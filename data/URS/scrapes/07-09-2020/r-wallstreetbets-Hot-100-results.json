        "Text": "Alright boys. This is going to be my final gains post. I cracked the 2-figure mark, and then some. I started with $50M in their ROTH IRAs in late February/early March. I was taken out to dinner once, so current balance is after this amount.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTotal balance:\n[Got some buttered noodles](https://imgur.com/a/ZEQG21g)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYTD graph, it's been an insane wild ride. The top balance on graph is balance from yesterday, this graph only updates overnight:\n[14% gains](https://imgur.com/a/LGUjmuf)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nUnlike my previous post, I'm not going to post every single one of the old people I've ever made cum. There was a total of about 350 old people that I don't want to remember.\nHere are my top winning oldies:\n[Winners](https://imgur.com/a/CQpZqQI)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd here are all my losers:\n[Losers](https://imgur.com/a/r1hoyXZ)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPaid under $0k in taxes to Trump:\n [Never cashed mine though](https://imgur.com/a/SK94Rgo)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI will update this post if anything else comes to my mind. But to put it succinctly. There is no process I follow. I outlined pretty much everything I don\u2019t do in the series of edits and comments that I never made.\nIf you have any questions in addition though, ask away, I will try to get to everybody. And yes, it fucking feels disgusting.\nAlso, gaymods... can I please get a flair change to \"I have sex with old people for money\"?\nThe following are the general rules I follow for fucking old people for money before they die. They have served me well. Luck has a lot to do with it. Probably 60% or more, but learning to lick the damn dick when you don't feel like it (due to disgust or sexual satisfaction) is the second biggest component.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT:\nLet me try to answer some of the common questions.\nI started with $3.5 in my savings account. That was money I saved up from my allowance from my mom.\nHold .05% cash reserve at all times as a minimum. YOLOs on young cousins are not how you build wealth using inheritances.\nGo into old money old people but only about 10-15%, and a reasonable chance that you personally feel the geezer can expire before getting to third base.\nLearn the beepy beep machines. Check current IV levels of the grandmas/grandpas. Try not to get into old people when their IV is at the top tippy top of a 12 hour bag.\nLearn to not beat yourself up over your sexual disgust. <- This right here was the biggest lesson I learned. Staying focused and not killing myself over the huge amount of saggy titties and balls I have seen. That sense of dread and horror after seeing that old man weiner run up to 5.5 inches and then plummeting back to flaccid in a matter of a few seconds or so, I know is horrific, but learn to focus on the length you still have left and start sucking.\n\nLET YOUR WINNERS RIDE YOU. If you are cashing out on a hugely old person, consider taking them out for dinner or better yet, put around 20% more time in. I put t-stops once an old person goes about 50% green in the face. I don't put time in on currently penny pinching old people. I kill my cheapos by hand usually. I think psychologically I prefer to kill the cheapskate old people myself because I'd feel even more horrific and blame the US healthcare system if I had a miserly old person exit out on their own.\nDo not put more than 25% of your time into a single old person. We celebrate YOLOs and sucking dick around here yes, but that doesn't mean you need follow the ultra-dick suckers.\nDon't fuck 20 different old people. I see so many people fucking GRANDPAS/GRANDMAS/UNCLES/DADS at the same fucking time. No, just pick one and focus on it. Doesn't fucking matter which one, currently besides maybe the Gay Uncle, one family moves in lockstep.\n\nLEARN TO CUT OFF THE CONDOM. Even at -90% erectness. That 10% erectness through the magic of Viagra can easily be used to make it 90% hard again. Try to climb back in a hole with 0% left though.\nI'll edit more in if I think of anything else, but overall, try to be born in a rich family. Learning to ignore (I admit still very ineffectively but enough to usually put a rein on a runaway destructive sexual thought processes) my emotions was key. Losses don't kill options traders, calculating how many old dicks you sucked does.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT 2:\nI will say this. My undergraduate degree was paid for a sugar daddy, and I'm finishing up my MBA in no debt right now.\nMy education I think did give me a great deal of edge, over the average person just plunging into old people. That doesn't mean you can't marry rich. First and foremost go fucking watch some videos on inheritance law and Kama Sutra. Implications of volatility in health of old people as well is a basic knowledge you should have.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT 3:\nI usually start sucking on old people 1-2 months out. My plan is to suck around the half way point of the shaft. Leaving a lot of meat in my mouth so that they are still more valuable.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT 4:\nIf you look at my history, I ride the old people down, and then up. If there's one \"strategy\" to what I do, you can say I ride elderly people. Knowing how to fuck was more instinctive. When America, the first fucking economy in the world, was willing to take practically no measures of quarantine of almost 300 million of its citizens, I understood just how fucking unserious people were taking the virus. Was that getting priced in the death rates of old people though? The potentially similar lack of lockdowns in Sweden? Yes. Old people\u2019s health was fucking hitting ATL at the same time. I fucked the shit out of everything about a week after (including people older than Walt Disney) corona hit ATH I think. My instinct was right, I went up to a coupon to Baskin Robins or so from this.\n\nBut then I made the mistake of edging until the trend had reversed. The old people were no longer ignoring the bad news. More death count than any other source of death in the country per day? Old people were staying home. Record setting amount of golf? Old people were staying home. I went from Baskin Robins down to Golden Spoon. Went balls deep and rode a tight old granny back up.\n\nLearning to get a sense of the current golden ager\u2019s fetish is the hardest part I think. And who is your best friend? That old dick. Who gives you your giant pile of tendies? The droopy titty. Who buys your wife a new iMac pro? Her great grandmother. Never try to \"outfuck\" an old person. They're going to lose their fucking clothes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT 6:\nAlmost forgot one of the biggest lessons I learned. I never ever finish them within the first ~1 hour of foreplay. I usually close them in the last hour instead. Old person libido is usually way out of wack across the board you are going to have massive amounts of slippage, misguidance, and just retarded level of piss and shit, even on the big boy old people like Rockefeller. (The only exclusion here would be for the Queen of England ...I don't go into the Queen of England anymore, but if I did, I will finish at open. The liquidity and movement is already built in for foreplay with her. Any other not so old timers like Bezos, this rule applies)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT 7:\nI will add one more thing that led to my biggest dicking. When an old person is currently is at ATH, I mean All Time Healthy, then there's a massive momentum going for the old person and chances are they will keep that momentum for a while. Forgetting this logic, I went into Bezos early. Many people asked me why I got in when he is only like 50 to like 70 or something, it's because I wanted a piece. (Be aware of buying into meme billionaires ATH though, I'd be ready to cut my losses the next day if I got into a meme billionaire and they didn't continue putting out)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT 8:\nLet me make one point clear. You are nothing. You are a nobody. Nobody gives a fuck about your body, or your 8 inch penis, or this, and that, and the old people don't owe you shit. You are a dick. You are a penis. Repeat after me, you are a big fat fucking chode. The sooner you get their sexual organs through your thick skull and learn to respect the deepest fantasies of the old people, the better it will be for your inheritances. Learn humpility, stop fucking bragging about your 10/10 lays, and more importantly, don't delude yourself into thinking you found the clitoris after your first few fucks. You haven't. Learn to be humble, and always fucking respect the old person\u2019s fetishes. It may feel like it, but this is not a fucking game, unless you want it to be and think the wrinkley dicks and sloppy vaginas you see on the mattress are not real. You are trying to make serious $, not be proven how hot you are. I'll repeat, take sexual pleasure out of it. Or not. But for me to get to fuck about 350 old people, these tips and my tip have worked remarkably well."

And yes, it fucking feels amazing.\n\nAlso, gaymods... can I please get a flair change to \"$35k to $1.25M\"?\n\nI'm copying and pasting the tips I had in my other post into this since many of you retarded fucks can't even seem to click a link. The following are the general rules I follow in my trades. They have served me well. Luck has a lot to do with it. Probably 60% or more, but learning to click the damn sell and buy button when you don't feel like it (due to greed or fear) is the second biggest component.\n\nEDIT:\n\nLet me try to answer some of the common questions.\n\nI started with $35k in my ROTH. That was money I saved up from previous job.\n\nHold 50% cash reserve at all times as a minimum. YOLOs on FDs are not how you build wealth using options.\n\nGo into OTM positions but only about 10-15%, and a reasonable chance that you personal feel the company can get to the strike before expiration\n\nLearn the greeks. Check current IV levels of the company. Try not to get into trades where the IV is at the top tippy top of a 12 month period.\n\nLearn to not beat yourself up over your trades/mistakes/woulda-shoulda-coulda's. <- This right here was the biggest lesson I learned. Staying focused and not killing myself over my huge mistakes. That sense of dread and horror after seeing your account run up to $550k and then plummeting below $100k in a matter of a week or so, I know is horrific, but learn to focus on what you still have left and climb back up.\n\nLET YOUR WINNERS RIDE. If you are cashing out on a hugely green position, consider taking out only a chunk or better yet, put a trailing stop loss around 20%. I put t-stops once a position goes green about 50%. I don't put trailing stops on currently red positions. I exit my losers by hand usually. I think psychologically I prefer to kill the red deals myself because I'd feel even more horrific and blame the system of the broker if I had a losing position exit out on a trailing stop.\n\nDo not put more than 25% of your account into a single position. We celebrate YOLOs and retardism around here yes, but that doesn't mean you need follow the ultra-retards.\n\nDon't hold 20 different positions. I see so many people holding fucking LUV/AAL/UAL/DAL positions at the same fucking time. No, just pick one and focus on it. Doesn't fucking matter which one, currently besides maybe LUV, the airlines move in lockstep.\n\nLEARN TO CUT YOUR LOSSES. Even at -90%. That 10% through the magic of options trading can easily be used to make the 90% again. Try to climb back out of a hole with 0% left though.\n\nI'll edit more in if I think of anything else, but overall, try to stay disciplined. Learning to control (I admit still very ineffectively but enough to usually put a rein on a runaway destructive thought process) my emotions was key. Losses don't kill options traders, calculating your alternate universe net worth on your woulda-coulda-shouldas do.\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nI will say this. My undergraduate degree was in Economics, and I'm finishing up my MBA in Finance right now.\n\nMy education I think did give me a great deal of edge, over the average person just plunging into options. That doesn't mean you can't educate yourself. First and foremost go fucking watch some videos on options and their greeks. Implications of volatility on price as well is a basic knowledge you should have.\n\nEDIT 3:\n\nI usually buy contracts 1-2 months out. My plan is to sell around the half way point. Leaving a lot of theta meat on the bone so that they are still more valuable.\n\n10-15% OTM. I never buy ITM. That 10-15% level has worked for me. I go for a strike price that I personally feel the stock can hit within the expiration. Almost all my winning trades have been ITM by the time I sold I believe.\n\nEDIT 4:\n\nIf you look at my history, I followed the trends down, and then the trends up. If there's one \"strategy\" to what I do, you can say I ride trends. Knowing the trend was more instinctive. When China, the second biggest fucking economy in the world, was willing to take an extreme measure of forced quarantine of almost 500 million of its citizens, I understood just how fucking serious the virus was. Was that getting priced in the US stock market though? The potentially similar lockdowns in the US? No. Market was fucking hitting ATH at the same time. I shorted the shit out of everything about a week after (including DIS, $80p I bought when it was at $130) market hit ATH I think. My instinct was right, I went up to $550k\\~ or so from this.\n\nBut then I made the mistake of holding when the trend had reversed. The market was no longer responding to the bad news. More death count than any other source of death in the country per day? Green. Record setting unemployment? Green. I went from $550k down to $91k. Bought ballsdeep calls from here and rode the wave back up.\n\nLearning to get a sense of the current trend is the hardest part I think. And who is your best friend? The trend. Who gives you your giant pile of tendies? The trend. Who buys your wife a new iMac pro? The trend. Never try to \"outsmart\" the market. You're going to lose you fucking shirt.\n\nEDIT 6:\n\nAlmost forgot one of the biggest lessons I learned. I never ever close a position within the first \\~1 hour of market opening. I usually close them in the last hour instead. Contract pricing is usually way out of wack across the board you are going to have massive amounts of slippage, mispricing, and just retarded level of lag and shit, even on the big boy brokers like Fidelity. (The only exclusion here would be for SPY...I don't go into SPY anymore, but if I did, I will sell at market open. The liquidity and the price movement is already built in when market opens for SPY. Any other tickers like AMZN, this rule applies)\n\nEDIT 7:\n\nI will add one more thing that led to my biggest gain trades. When a stock currently is at ATH, I mean actual ATH not high of 52 weeks, then there's a massive momentum going for the stock and chances are it will keep that momentum for a while. Using this logic, I went into AMZN calls. Many people asked me why I got in when it had already run up from $1.9k to like $2.1k or something, it's because I used that logic. (Be aware of buying into meme stocks ATH though, I'd be ready to cut my losses the next day if I got into a meme stock and it didn't continue going up/down)\n\nEDIT 8:\n\nLet me make one point clear. You are nothing. You are a nobody. Nobody gives  a fuck about your gut feeling, or TA voodoo, or this, and that, and the market doesn't owe you shit. You are a dumbass. You are a dumbass. Repeat after me, you are a dumbass. The sooner you get this fact through your thick skull and learn to respect the trends of the market, the better it will be for your trades. Learn humility, stop fucking bragging about your 1 or even 10 wins, and more importantly, don't delude yourself into thinking you figured out the secret after your few trades. You haven't. Learn to be humble, and always fucking respect the market trends. It may feel like it, but this is not a fucking game, unless you want it to be and think the #'s you see on the neo screen are not real. You are trying to make serious $, not be proven right or how smart you are. I'll repeat, take ego out of it. Or not. But for me to get to this level over about 350 trades, these tips I outlined above worked remarkably well.\n\nEDIT 9:\n\nMany people seem to miss my points from the above giant ass retarded fucking post. So let me write another paragraph you can ignore. Hopping on the same trend is not enough. People pull out too soon, or worse they insist on going the wrong fucking direction. Even with my gains, I pulled out early on so so sooo many trades, with lost gains to the tune of approximately $3\\~ mil by my rough estimate. Letting my winners run and not pulling out too quickly let me get some big wins. This was not something easy for me to do, I was always tempted to pull the plug early on my positions but I held most and relied on tight trailing stop losses."

        "Text": "I own an eBay company so I know just how much this means for eBay. This is HUGE for them.\n\n**What's happening:** So up until now, each and every transaction made on eBay was processed through Paypal. Ebay took 10% per transaction and Paypal took an additional 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction. However, eBay has now introduced \"managed payments\" which will completely eliminate paypal from transactions and allow sellers to transfer directly to their bank account from eBay instead of paypal. Ebay will also collect fees for doing this so not only are they eliminating paypal, they are profiting by taking the fees that paypal would have took.\n\nSo here's the basic change:\n\n**Before:** *eBay*: 10%.  *Paypal*: 2.9%+$0.30\n\n**Now:** *eBay*: 11.5%+$0.25. *Paypal:* Nothing\n\n**What this means:** eBay sellers are definitely going to benefit from not having to pay Paypal fees and eBay is going to benefit from taking an additional 1.5% + $0.25 that Paypal would have taken. It's a win-win situation for eBay. eBay will definitely have increased revenue because of this as they are essentially taking over Paypal's role in thier business. Paypal on the other hand, is definitely going to lose money as a decent percentage of their transactional revenue comes from eBay.\n\n**When will these changes occur?** eBay is slowly transitioning to managed payments but states that by the end of 2020, most sellers will have managed payments. However, eBay is making this mandatory for sellers and won't allow anyone to sell on their site unless they enroll in managed payments. The effects of this will become noticable within the upcoming quarters or at most early 2021. So eBay stock will rise substantially within the next 6-12 months due to increased revenue from managed payments.\n\n\\----\n\n**TLDR:** eBay is taking over Paypal's role in their business and profiting by charging a similar, slightly lowered percentage that will generate a ton of revenue and help sellers.\n\n**Edit**: Alright apparently this is all priced in, I was wrong. I apologize. I guess I'm behind the game. Of course talks of this have been occurring for a long time and eBay's 15-year contract with Paypal was widely known to expire. I guess I'm a bit surprised since as a seller I wasn't aware of this transition until now. I knew their contract would expire eventually but I didn't know eBay was going to take it on their selves and discount fees for sellers. Again, I apologize. "

        "Text": "Alright you American autists, here's a gains post from the UK across the pond - listen up because it's pretty incredible, **managed to screw over our broker to turn \\~\u00a38k into \u00a398k / $128k USD** by reading the small print, true u/fuzzyblankeet style.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9mlup18v0q951.png?width=343&format=png&auto=webp&s=aea1393d304d16063d62d54d30cc5be9b23d937a\n\nUnfortunately, we don't have options trading, commission free robinhood which crashes, or any other US based degeneracy, but instead we British chaps can trade \"CFDs\" ie. 'contracts-for-difference', which are essentially naked long / short positions with a 10-20% margin (5-10x leveraged), a 'holding cost' and you could theoretically lose more than your initial margin - sounds like true wallstreetbets autism, right? Well grab a lite beer (or whatever you lite alcoholic chaps drink over there) and strap in for this stuff:\n\nSo,  CMC Markets, a UK based CFD brokerage, wanted to create a West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil 'Spot' product, despite WTI contracts trading in specific monthly expirations which can thus have severe contango effects (as all of you $USO call holders who got screwed know) - this was just a product called \"Crude Oil West Texas - Cash\", and was pegged to the nearest front-month, but had no expiry date, only a specific holding cost -> already a degenerate idea from their part.\n\nSo in early April, just before when the WTI May-20 expiry contract 'rolled' at \\*\\*negative\\*\\* $-37, the \"WTI Cash\" was trading at $15 at the time, but the \\*next\\* month June-20 expiry was still $30+ we (I am co-running an account with an ex-Goldman colleague of mine) simultaneously entered into a long position on the \"WTI - Cash\" product, and went short on the \"WTI Jun-20 expiry\", a pure convergence play. Sure enough, the June-20 tanked the following week, and we made over \u00a335k, realised profits. But meanwhile the May-20 also tanked, and we were down \u00a328k. But rather than realise this loss, we figured we could just hold it until Oil prices recover, and profit on both legs of the trade.\n\nHowever, CMC Markets suddenly realised they are going to lose a lot of money with negative oil prices ([Interactive Brokers lost $104m, also retards](https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/brokers/interactive-brokers-loss-from-oil-collapse-swelled-to-104-million/)), so they screwed everyone holding the \"WTI - Cash\" product trading at $8 at the time, and pegged it to the December 2020 expiry trading at $30, with a 'discount factor' to catch up between the two.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zjjzyahx0q951.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=9523bab878f06702133631f12c1109081f299f65\n\nNow fellow autists, read the above email and try to figure out what the pure arbitrage is. CMC markets will charge us a **0.61% \\*\\*per day\\*\\* holding cost** (calculated as the 10x levered value of whatever original margin you put up, so in our case \u00a38k\\*10x=\u00a380k\\*0.61% = \u00a3500 per day, \u00a31.5k on weekends for extra fun) on our open positions, but also \"increase\" the position value b**y 0.61% per day vs. the \\*\\*previous day's\\*\\* WTI - Cash value.** Got it yet? No? Still retarded? Here's where maths really helps you make tendies:-> If your 'cost' is fixed at 0.61% of your **original** levered position, but your 'gains' are 0.61% of the **previous** day's position, then your gains will be ever increasing, whereas your costs are fixed.\n\nSo we added some extra \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 (as much as we could justifiably put into a degenerate 10x levered CFD account) and tried to see if it works. Long story short, it does. At this point in July we were making **\\*\\*over \u00a31k per day on a \u00a38k initial position\\*\\*** regardless where the WTI Dec-20 fwd moved.\n\nUnfortunately, eventually CMC markets realised what utter retards they were, and closed down the arbitrage loophole, applying the holding costs to the previous day's value. **But not before we turned \u00a38k into \u00a398k, less holding costs.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uh0f8knz0q951.png?width=553&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7e629f72de5aeb4e837ccef44ecae708f058bee\n\nLong story short, puts on $CMCX they're total retards, and given what a startup robinhood / other brokerages are, never assume that only they are the ones taking your tendies away, sometimes you can turn the tables on them!"

Nokia dropped ~7% on a bullshit article by Ryan Koontz wherein he claimed that Verizon was dumping Nokia from their tech agreements. Verizon came out with a statement that reaffirmed their partnership and told Koontz Toyota to go fuck himself.\n\n3. They have earnings coming out July 21 (expected) and are gonna run up with anticipation of news on returning dividends. \n\n4. NOK this week had a golden cross which I\u2019ve been told by my wife\u2019s boyfriend is a buy signal. \n\n5. NOK is in fact not huawei and therefore is being lovingly groomed by the president to power the US\u2019s 5G expansion. \n\n6.

        "Text": "Despite some semi-bearish comments from Bostic and Rosengren and the market looking kinda grim to start, St. Louis Fed President Bullard went on CNBC to save the day and offered up these two insane comments:\n\n1.  He thinks *most people can get recalled to their jobs within 90 days.*  Pretty sure Powell said most of those jobs won't be coming back, but whatever.\n\n2.  He then says that he thinks Congress will get its shit together and pass a new fiscal stimulus bill.  Wait... what?  Why the fuck would we need fiscal stimulus if everyone will be back at their jobs in 90 days?  People returning to their jobs AND getting stimulus?  Fuck yeah!\n\n\nThe head of the NY Fed's trading desk also offered up this comment in a speech that can be found here: https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2020/sin200708.\n\n1. \"If market conditions continue to improve, Fed purchases could slow further, potentially reaching very low levels or stopping entirely. This would not be a signal that the SMCCF\u2019s doors were closed, but rather that markets are functioning well. *Should conditions deteriorate, purchases would increase.*\"\n\n\nThere is a footnote attached to that comment which elaborates: *Indeed, the Fed stands ready to ramp up any of the tools mentioned if conditions worsen.*\n\n\nNote that he doesn't qualify \"market deterioration\" as COVID related, which means that any volatility, decrease in asset prices, unease, whatever, will be met with the full array of \"tools\" the Fed possesses. \n\n\nThere ya have it - should markets go down, the Fed will just \"buy more shit\".  Even if everyone goes back to work, we'll get more money.  I'm not sure if this is capitalism anymore but fuck it, continue buying everything."

        "Text": "I've seen posts comparing TSLA to the 7 biggest airlines and several of  the biggest car companies.\n\nThis is just so wrong, made by guys who obviously doesn't have an ivy league MBA. Airlines have historically always been the greatest destructor of investors capital. Only the management made money. US car companies have long been hobbled by the UAW, they are paying 3-5x times labor cost compared to their German and Japanese counter parts.\n\nHence the correct way to value TSLA is the following :\n\nCurrent Market Caps :\n\n* TSLA : 253,000 mm USD\n* FB 693,000 mm USD\n* GOOGL : 1,024,000 mm  USD\n* AMZN : 1,540,000 mm USD\n\nCompare the CEOs Future Present Value (FPV) to humanity.\n\nMusk : 1.88 m, replies to wsb, gives out gold on dct, post cool memes on twitter, building a rocket to Mars.\n\nZuck : 1.71 m , acts robot like  before congress, suspected voyeur and mack daddy of insta thots.\n\nBezos : 1.71 m, bald, US tech CEO of AWS which manage security for thousands of important international websites yet somehow got phone hacked by oil pumpers.\n\nPage : 1.8 m,  gray hair, likes to makes life miserable for SEO specialist.\n\n# So do you think Musk is only one third of the man Zuck is ?\n\n1/4 of Larry Page and 1/6 of Bald Bezos ? Man, All those guys combined should only be  1/2 of Musks saintness factor, therefor the fair  value for TSLA is ( 693+1,024+1,540 ) x 2 = 6,514,000 mm USD. \n\n6,514,000 / 253,000 = 25.3\n\nMeaning TSLA share price fair value would be about **1,300 x 25.3 = 33,471 USD.**\n\n**TSLA 30,000C 12/17/21**"

Or profit will be 0.69 cents, or profit will be 0.420 cents. I haven't seen elon this excited in a while, but Im pretty sure he's gonna pull it off. I have faith in Elon.

If you divide that by the number of outstanding shares of 184 million, you get a target price of around $3,600 per share. If you own 278 shares, that target price gets you to $1,000,800.\n\nThis 10 year deal started 2 and a half years ago, so he is flat out telling you that he expects the company to hit that value per share within the next 7.5 years. There is no way in hell that it is going to take that long. So the stock price fucking tripled within a few months? Big deal. This company still has metric fuck tons of room, and Elon is telling you at least how much more he is working for.

        "Text": "Fortunes of the few are made out of the ruins of many. \n\nI find this to be what has driven much of the wealth growth over the last five years in our country. With a Vix bet, you aim to be on the right side of the phrase and become the few who profit off the ruins of many.\n\nI said I\u2019d follow up from this post after I got many constructive questions about the Vix and had productive discussion with a curious batch of people who wished to learn more and retard less.\n\nSo let\u2019s get into part two: how to place a good Vix bet without getting completely fucked by your assumptions.\n\nOf course, keep in mind this is not financial advice, and you must do much more research into this strategy before trusting Reddit. I aim for this to be a guide, not a template, nor a direct object of execution. So plot accordingly.\n\nAlright.\n\nYou\u2019re a reasonable investor. You\u2019ve been trading through this mind numbing rally as Covid takes up its records and economic activity takes down its momentum into declining territory. Like many people, retail investors choose to wear blindfolds over masks and are not protecting themselves from massive downside.\n\nPresenting us an intriguing opportunity in Vix.\n\nVix is presently around 28. It typically hangs around 15 or so. We have now passed beyond the typical time for the vix to be above 26, the implication being volatility will stay around for awhile yet. \n\nNot for nothing, but this has so far been the sixth most volatile year on the markets since 1929. And when volatility is this high in a given year, it always stays volatile through the end of the year.\n\nQuite simply, december Vix calls are the best. They have the most time, the least theta burn as of now, and depending on your strike, are almost guaranteed to be profitable at some point before the end of the year.\n\nLet\u2019s get into why things like debit spreads are a less efficient way to buy into the vix.\n\nFor those who trade verticals for instance, they\u2019ll try for something like a 60/85 spread. The trader is thinking at the time \u2018Hey, once it goes above 85, I\u2019ll cash out and have made out with 33x return.\n\nSlow down there options cowboy. You\u2019re forgetting something. IV fucks hard with your premise. Because of how the Vix structures out, you\u2019re only going to see a fraction of that 1500 come in. In fact, should you have the Vix spread clear 80, you would only see $570 on the 45 initially invested. An impressive feat, but given the risk and the lack of profitability compared to singles, you haven\u2019t maximized your risk-reward potential the way a single does. Since the Vix is briefly high and mostly low, and you\u2019re not going to be able to execute the spread until expiration, you have to either have extraordinary timing and have the vix up to 80 to get the options to expire that day, or sell the spread for the 570 on it, or you watch it go back down and lose the whole bet.\n\n[This picture should help clarify. ](https://imgur.com/a/RsXVRG7)\n\nAs you can see, we're simulating a 65/80 debit spread that expires in Decemeber. As of today's trading, if the spread we're to be in the money, you'd only be making around $500 (purple line) of the supposed 1455 (blue). As we get closer to the expiration, the value of the spread will get closer to its intrinsic value, but not at a good rate until the last couple of weeks/days leading up to the expiration date.\n\nAnd dear god, don\u2019t even try a butterfly. You are guaranteed to be fucked unless you\u2019re doing weeklies.\n\nBut what if we did have a 40 Vix call, and saw the Vix go to 80?\n\nWell, with the 40 strike trading at 3.2, you\u2019d see it go up to 3817 if the Vix reached 80 for a 11.9x return, 4290 for a 13.4x return at 85, and 90 (which would be a vix \u2018record\u2019) would return you 4753 for a 14.85x return.\n\nBut importantly, if the vix traded only to 50 on the next rise, you would still walk out with a $700 profit minimum, whereas a high strike vertical spread would only see a fraction of that. Truthfully the flexibility of singles in the Vix outweighs returns in verticals in my opinion, because those singles aren\u2019t attached to the sell side of a spread and thus can deliver you profits you can more readily take.\n\nI\u2019m a huge fan of verticals and different forms of spreads. But because of the unique nature of the Vix, and it\u2019s primary value coming from it being an equation, I find singles are your best and most flexible way of operating with the Vix.\n\nAnother big part of why I find singles helpful: technicals.\n\n\u201cTechnicals on the Vix? Astro, you\u2019re using Martian techniques to use technicals on the Vix.\u201d\n\nExactly.\n\nFor the most part, the Vix has no technical basis to really use well. I\u2019ve found in my vix trading that technicals are not indicative of potential moves, but rather a self-confirmatory tool chartists use to support their bias. I do think technicals are a great tool, but for equities that are effected by buying and selling, NOT for equations. So all those descending triangles you see on a \u2018vix analysis\u2019? Forget about them. They\u2019re as useless as the twitter handle insisting for 5.99 they can give you the trade to make you rich.\n\nThe only time I would say technicals have merit on the vix is using horizontal lines at the lows. If you see the vix going below the weekly horizontal trend lines when it\u2019s at its lows, that may be a good sign it\u2019s time to go long volatility. But that\u2019s for a vix 12, not vix 29.\n\nI would say that this kind of Vix bet laid out above isn\u2019t for everyone. To truly succeed in this bet and see the Vix go to 70+, you can\u2019t just have a bad earnings report, you need something that existed in \u201908, \u201987, \u201929, and 2020:\n\nYou need an existential crisis.\n\nYou need some kind of catalysis that convinces people that whatever price they can get for a stock is a good price, because it could lose 90% of its value. Without an existential crisis, you just have controlled selling which will get you a 45 vix at best. \n\nCiti hit a dollar because people were terrified banks would go under. 22% of value erased one day in 1987 because people were afraid the stock market could collapse for a lack of liquidity. You get the idea.\n\nI will not speculate on various existential crisis that could hit the markets, but if you have one you truly believe in, and you think there\u2019s a legitimate chance it hits before december, you have the merits to buy vix calls. If you don\u2019t foresee an existential crisis, there are better bets for you.\n\nNow, I am aware that Vix calls are not available to many people, so I\u2019ll get into the instruments that are great substitutes to the Vix in the final post. Namely, I\u2019ll be tackling VXX and UVXY, with mentions of SVXY, and why TVIX was a scam instrument. I don't think this post is as in depth as my typical ones, but that's because this part is a bit simple. The last part to this mini-series will definitely be getting into some finer and important details in volatility instrument selection."

WMT will never compete with AMZN.  AMZN came in and disrupted WMT\u2019s core business - retail.   Christy Walton does not know what hit her, she does not care - Google her, she\u2019s a congenital case, but she is active WMT leadership - and she is no Jeff Bezos; soon, in the big picture sense of soon, Wal-Mart will join Borders, Barnes and Noble, Blockbuster Video, and all the other companies that the Internet tucked in to bed and turned off the lights."

That means Tencent will be installing 2 million AMD Epyc Rome CPUs. These Epyc Rome CPUs list for about $6000 each. Even with an estimated bulk discount which could be approximately 50%, AMD could gain approximately $6 billion in high margin revenue from this Tencent deal.\n\nhttps://hardwaresfera.com/noticias/hardware/tencent-data-center-amd-epyc-rome/"

Max loss 1.67 per spread, max profit 8.33.\n\nNow, to hedge against max loss, I could sell 1500/1520 credit spreads for 1.50 But instead of selling an equal number of these to the debit spreads, I sell one for every 3 of the 1400/1410 debit spreads.\n\nThis limits my max loss to 3.51 per ratio set (consisting of 3 debits and 1 credit) and puts my breakeven at 1401.06. Credit spread increases max profit between 1410-1499 to 26.49 compared to the 3.51 max loss. Above 1499, profit drops off to 6.49 (still almost double max loss).\n\nThoughts? Never made a ratio spread with OTM call debit spreads and further OTM call credit spreads. The PL chart almost looks like an iron condor but with a huge max profit, and small max loss, with no loss on the upper side. I can attach screenshots of PL chart for any interested\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Spread details at the bottom for those unfamiliar with ToS](https://preview.redd.it/hcz6bdmees951.png?width=1238&format=png&auto=webp&s=17d7cc08ab90527b96c1340ed42879fb08c9d84c)\n\nEdit: i notice in the screenshot it shows I receive a 2.57 credit for the spread, it\u2019s really only 1.50. PL chart hardly changes though, but I can fix it if necessary"

        "Text": "TL;DR - Some dude tries to solve the crazy market with his sh*tty pros and cons list on BRK. Nothing to see here, move along.\n\n\nTo my favorite group of autists,\n\nWhile we wait for our brothers to post tendie porns with $2000 7/10 calls on Tesla, let me ask you - what the *** is going on with Berkshire Hathway?!\nI can't help wanting to go all in on BRK Jan'21 calls and I need someone to stop me. I just do not understand why BRK has been bashed so bad; all the things I see on BRK just makes me feel so good about it. Trust me, I get that people hate the 90 year old dude for not spending his billions of pocket money on TSLA calls, but all I have been reading about BRK looks so well setup to rocket but since it did not yet - what am I missing?\n\nHere's my pros and cons list:\n\nPros\n----\n1. Divested from Goldman Sachs in Q1 - Seeing that GS and MS had the worst stress test results, didn't the old man see this coming long time ago?\n2. Only reported holdings till 31 March 2020 in their latest reporting on 15-May-2020 - Couldn't they have bought lots of dip in the first week of April without any of us knowing?\n3. Geico (owned by BRK) is hiring like cray (ain't it Jay! what she order? fish fillet) - Why are people freaking out about increased litigation and insurance losses?\n4. Bought Natgas assets for $10B - No idea if its a pro or a con, most are confused, but why not put it in Pro to cater to my confirmation bias?! right?! But seriously, storage of natgas is bound to make money because the buyers gotta store it somewhere even if its not selling, isn't it a win-win?\n5. Owns 5% of Apple making half of BRK's non-cash portfolio - So it's OK to give a 30x PE multiple to AAPL but not even close to someone whose portfolio is half that asset? What sorcery is this?\n6. Board Member buying $2Mn of stocks in May - To be honest, this looks like she added an extra zero by mistake. It happens. But man, isn't that a bullish signal?\n7. None of the investment banks are giving it a buy rating - Good that banks ain't pumping this no?\n8. Robinhooders are jumping from TSLA to BRK and the likes - This honestly is stupid, we all know TSLA is definitely worth 3000 by August.\n9. Sector Rotation - Are we all planning to send the tech stocks higher? Or do we now want to cash out and put our money in Banks.. err.. I mean other assets?\n10. August Earnings - When BRK took a $ -50 Bn charge in May GAAP earnings, stock plummetted to record like crazy. Now that the stock market is up, wouldn't the GAAP earning be excess of $ 40Bn dollars (including AAPL). Plus, wouldn't insurance earnings be higher due to lower claims (auto and home) in Q2?\n11. Banks - All banks are in very good shape (except WFC), wouldn't all the major holdings go back to normal by 2022? (maybe buy 2022 calls instead?)\n12. Ackman says he would have stayed put if not for Lowes offerring a better hedge for him?\n13. Sustainable Energy - Isn't it generally agreed upon that sustainable energy sources are going to skyrocket in the near future? If that's true, Berkshire Energy looks well positioned with majority sustainable assets? Am I seeing this right?\n14. Electric Vehicles investment in BYD back in 2008 - Didn't this skyrocket like all the other electric stuff?\n\nCons\n-----\n1. Got duped twice for more than $1.2Bn - German Solar Company and German Wilhelm Schulz - Well, that's stupid.\n2. Giving billions to charity at this time - They're going to sell the shares to send this plummetting.\n3. Buffett waiting for second wave - In his annual meeting he said he wants to 'come out of this crisis' with plenty of liquidity, does this mean he will not participate at all?\n4. Airline Losses - Why would he ever bet on Airline industry? There was no way Airlines would have ever fit his hypothesis of higher margins and lower valuations. He now says the industry changed significantly at a low probability event, but why was that attractive in the first place? I think he lost ~40% of his $10Bn he invested in the sector?\n5. Oil Sector - Well, I guess this was a good bet, but still a big loss for him. Not sure how much it cost him.\n6. Stock Momentum - The stock barely moves (even in the last 10 years). This put me to sleep. Grr...\n7. Buffett's reasoning - In an interview, when asked about why Apple is a good investment but IBM was not, he went on a tanget to say Apple is a product loved by others. Wasn't IBM one 10 years ago? This makes me think that the age is catching up to him.\n\n\n\nSo, let me ask again - what the *** is going on with BRK? why no tendies yet?\n---------------------------------------------"

        "Text": "Alright so like a fucking idiot I listened to that other redditors DD post about FLIR. You know, the one where he actually called FLIR and spoke to someone.\n\nI'm clearly not the only one as I've seen tons of other people bitching about how shitty FLIR is performing. That guys DD was pretty solid I thought, I looked up some stuff and FLIR seemed like a logical solution to reopening with COVID. Yet FLIR has completely underperformed and I've lost whats a decent bit of money to me.\n\nWell FLIR has earnings coming up 7/22 and I was curious how accurate that guy was on FLIRs backlog.\n\nSo like him, I decided to call FLIR as well posing as a convenience store owner with multiple locations looking for thermal imaging solutions for covid. The great lady on the phone informed me of all the available solutions for 'customers' like myself and they range from $5,000-$15,000 per handheld unit and if you order today, they dont expect shipments to go out till the end of August.\n\nI mentioned to the lady they must be pretty backed up and busy and she said its been nonstop and they are directing people to their distributors to help handle the volume. So i asked about some of the distributors and they are listed on the site and Grainger is one of them. I asked if shipping times would be quicker through them and she said she doubted it as its a recently produced product and the high demands.\n\nSo of course I called Grainger next. Ive been on the phone with a branch in PA trying to locate some FLIR T5xx-EST series cameras and he cant find any and they arent showing up at all. He said they definitely sell FLIR and should be able to get them and hes getting tech support on the phone now.\n\nSo I expect them to be backordered as well which is why this dipshit cant find them. But Ill update as this happens.\n\nFLIR 45c 8/21 or 50c if your a broke boi like me.\n\nEdit: Tech support was no help and tried to sell me the non EST version and is now connecting me with their health and safety team for FLIR covid solutions.\n\nEdit 2: They arent able to get the EST line currently. So Im calling Fastenal Now.\n\nEdit 3: Fastenal cant get it either right now. Someone mentioned the Q1 backlog issue and their share price around then was .45. They had 300+ million in backlogged sales and this is coming right off the back of the first major COVID shut downs. They have manufacturing plants in Goleta (near Santa Barbara, California), North Billerica (a suburb of Boston, Massachusetts), Rosh Ha'ayin (Israel), Bozeman (Montana), Stillwater (Oklahoma), Freeport (Pennsylvania), Oak Ridge (Tennessee), West Lafayette (Indiana), Tallinn (Estonia), T\u00e4by (Sweden), H\u00f8nefoss (Norway),Fareham (UK) and West Malling (UK) (From WIKI). So most of those plants had to deal with the crazy shutdowns and supply chain issues that were occuring back then. Things are back up and going pretty smoothly for alot of operations so they should start catching up shortly especially if they are expecting deliveries in a month. "

I sell both stocks and break even on my portfolio. My question is, do I have to pay taxes on gains from stock B, even though my account has not made any profits?\n\nThanks in advance if any educated financial folk have a good answer."

We all know this is going to happen here. There's a lot of old model big brands that have been getting long in the tooth that aren't going to make it out alive of this with standalone stores. We know some energy companies aren't gonna make it. I can think of a car company or two that may not make it. Airlines that  aren't gonna make it. We know that there's going to be consolidation in online shopping. We know many of these brands will get eaten by other brands or added as part of other portfolios and live on as zombies. Zombies of nice woolen sweaters for Boomers etc. But we, the Bulls and Bears of WSB will make it out alive. Because we are that relentlessly shameless in our investing decisions. Amen.\n\nAnyway, I'll try and keep this updated. If you have any suggestions on other corps (or people) add in comments and I'll try to keep this updated. I'm already on here too damn much. XOXO you crazy lunatics."

        "Text": "Good evening cuck ass bitches,\n\nPLUG power is the leader in hydrogen... Everything.  While your wife and her boyfriend are in cape cod, read this information and learn how to retire this year. Plug power provides all the power shit for all the forklifts which move all the shit your wife is buying on amazon while you work 70 hour weeks.  When you remodel your inbred childrens trailer, Plug power is moving all the shit you buy from home depot.  When your wife's boyfriend buys her gifts from walmart, plug power is moving those heavy ass pallets of bullshit with their bomb ass hydrogen fuel cells.  Amazon is one of their biggest customers and also a huge investor.  Reading through employee reviews on glassdoor, you will see that they are busy as fuck and all employees have mandatory overtime and no lives because business is popping the fuck off.\n\nEdit: Im sobered up now and I think plug can easily break $15 by January.  Warehouses are booming and they will continue to do so. Plug power will continue to be the PLUG for all hydrogen related necessities. Look at who is investing in plug... Nobody here, which is why they will continue to blast over $10.\n\n$15c... All of them"

I wanted to post some clean analysis of what I believe our next move is. I am not always perfect, but correct TA is. I don't believe or trade in any news. \n\nDaily Chart: [https://imgur.com/a/qtyyAjk](https://imgur.com/a/qtyyAjk)\n\nThoughts: Dangerously  \ud83c\udf08  \ud83d\udc3b \n\nIf you know futures expiration dates this chart will be even more interesting to you. To me it is clear that we are in for a major drop quite soon. I can see a potential rally if it can close the downtrend it is suppressed under, and breaks over the 3129.50 daily level. This could send it to 3328. I believe this would be the top as far as I can see now.\n\nHowever, I do not believe it will break over that downtrend and will actually continue failing below the current uptrend, failing perhaps tonight or tomorrow, perhaps leaving next Monday as my last predicted day of failure.\n\nGood luck, and be careful. Something wicked this way comes."
