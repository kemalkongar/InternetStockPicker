Based on this list, we can say that JP Morgan has a lot of exposure on mortgage backed securities to a point that Fed needs to back them up. (not a good sign)\\n\\nAccording to [its newly released transaction data for TALF](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/mlf-ppplf-pdcf-mmlf-cpff-pmccf-smccf-talf-7-10-20.pdf), it has made a total of $252 million in loans thus far \\u2013 the vast majority of which involved commercial real estate loans issued by the biggest Wall Street banks at some point over the past seven years. In the report, Fed says:\\n\\n>As described in the Board\\u2019s initial report to Congress regarding the TALF, the TALF includes features that are intended to mitigate risk to the Federal Reserve. The Board continues to expect that the TALF will not result in losses to the Federal Reserve.\\n\\nTALF loans are currently set to mature on June 26, 2023 \\u2013 which means that one would need an outlook that shows the U.S. recovering from the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression in a period of three years, not possible until a miracle happens.

I'm just saying that everyone is buying Ryzen anyway, because they are good enough and far cheaper. \\n\\n7nm isn't about gaming rigs. Gaming rigs are a tiny fraction of the consumer PC market.\\n\\n7nm chips are smaller, run cooler, and are more power efficient. This is critical for laptops and ultrabooks, and I have a hard time believing that companies like Apple and Dell will just wait for Intel until 2033 when AMD has these chips now.\", \"Intel's benefit is what is screwing them. They manufacture their die in house, which obviously reduces overhead but this could lead to falling behind which is happening. People bring up that intel current chips are as good or better, but at what cost. Usually it's power consumption and integrability. Used intel for the past 10 years and had to swap out motherboards for almost every upgrade. You can use the same motherboard for the last 3-4 generations of AMD chips, including the ones that are coming out.

Now imagine when Intel finally learns how to make 7nm chips.\", \"I think Apple is moving to in-house silicon anyway, or they want to. We'll see where the consumer laptop and notebook market goes, but it's quicker to change than something like servers. If Intel gets their shit together, they can eliminate this competitive advantage AMD currently has. It's a big if, of course. I like to think it's not blind faith, and that the company has proven itself over the years.\", \"I'm just saying that as Moore's law slows, the difference in generation becomes less important relative to the difference in design/performance.

Reason why i9 has performance crown is sheer clockspeed which is the one thing their 14 nm is good at.

Cutting taxes for wealthy business owners helps a little, but giving that money directly to the people would result in lots more spending.

Businesses would benefit a lot from this policy because they'll have a lot more customers. Less people would also be defaulting on loans and mortgages or skipping rent, resulting in a more stable economy.

AMZN has the 4th largest market cap in the world. Companies that have high market caps are much less volatile (aapl, msft, tsla, etc). On average, AMZN sees <0.5% pps fluctuations.\\n2. At the same time, AMZN's share price needs to increase nearly 17% in 5 days for your contract to expire ITM. This is almost unheard of for a company that has a share price at $3000. Remember TSLA's run up that brought its share price from $1000 -> $1700? This 70% increase took 15 trading days; so on average, it had a price velocity of around 4%+ every consecutive day for this to be possible. AMZN needs to increase its share price by 3.4% on average per day for 3500c to print; thus, it requires that level of hype and optimism that TSLA had and probably even more, since the price of AMZN's share is already high enough and it wouldn't flock in as many retards as it did. Further, a share price increase of at least 3.4% has happened merely 14 times in the past year. 6 of which happened during the corona recovery phase, so I would discount this. So 3% (8/253) percent chance that it'll see 3.4%+ in a day. And therefore, seeing 17% increase in share price within 5 days, is less than 3%.\\n3. High possibility of AMZN share selloffs post earnings. Remember when TSLA and MSFT beat earnings expectations, and yet its prices still plummeted? Who's to say the same won't happen to AMZN despite their earnings expectations and already inflated prices? Furthermore, do you have any supporting data that their earnings beat isn't priced in?\\n4. Unlikely, but what happens when there's good vaccine news within the next 5 trading days? AMZN is a COVID stock, so if there's any good news from any of the 100+ biotech firms that are racing to produce the first vaccine, AMZN's stock price will most likely fall.\\n\\nAMZN needs to overcome so many hurdles for your calls to print, and it has to be one of the most retarded bets I've seen to this date.

AMD's current 7nm are equivalent to Intel's 10nm, if you don't agree do a quick Google search. Intel is simply better in the architecture area and due to their limitations on 7nm they've had almost a decade to improve it behind the scenes.

Which meant that if you lost your job in March you could tell yourself a comforting story that bonus unemployment would easily tide you over until you went back to work in June or whenever. Less stress, more optimism versus 2008 when if you lost your job, it felt like it could be forever.\\n\\n3. The Federal Reserve REALLY got ahead of a potential financial crisis and nipped it in the bud.

What got us out of 2008 was quantitative easing, but the government did not put this into effect for quite sometime.

Like a cure for recession, why doesn\\u2019t every government do this? \\n\\nBecause they don\\u2019t have reserve-currency status, the USD does. Given that the oil-trade and much of the world\\u2019s debt is USD-denominated, it can only be dealt in USD, leading to significant demand for the dollar. This is one of many (but is the biggest) reason why we can print so much money without seeing any negative effect... in the short term. Long-term this destabilizes the dollar and adds to the growing case being made for why the world needs to move away from the USD. Without reserve-currency status, we\\u2019re left with massive asset-inflation, and old Sam\\u2019s printer being out of juice, we\\u2019ll have to stomach the effects of a recession greater than anything we have seen before.

The specific issue is with a process called patterning which involves splitting up features into different masks and then lining them up on the final die. Keep in mind that the intel 7nm process works just as TSMC's process works. The difference is that with both the amount of reject dies is very high but TSMC/AMD has elected to deal with higher reject levels.

This means a single error would leave that die unusable, while AMD could still use 75% of it.

What people don't realize is that most enterprise software charges based on the number of cores on the machine, and those software licenses are generally several times more expensive than the processor in the server.

The thought process is very similar to a run on banks in that if you're holding mid term corporate debt that you intended to liquidate in a year or two you think \\\"wow, the corporate market is really running in to issues, I'll sell now\\\".  This creates a cascading effect where liquidity just continues to dry up and spreads continue to widen - the Fed simply stepping in and promising to open a corporate facility alleviates this.  They may never need to purchase a single bond but the promise is there.  So now your institution that planned on liquidating in six months or a year doesn't run for safety today because the Fed has effectively promised to backstop credit availability should they need to - in this sense the promise is more important than them actually injecting anything in to markets.\\n\\nIn simplistic terms rolling out the corporate credit facilities was effectively just \\\"I'll catch you if you fall\\\" to allow the market to continue operating without fear of credit crunches down the line.\", \"An actual high quality post that challenges my view.

They just can't talk about the work they did for the other company, or directly replicate it (in the sense of discovery - if you were paid to type up letters you can obviously type up letters at the new company, but you can't tell your new boss that your old boss is working on a new product line which you learned from typing up one of his letters).\\n\\nJust about every company requires NDAs and they're really not a big deal.  They still get skirted to a degree - you can't talk about exactly what your employer did before but often people end up taking advantage of processes they learned about.  However, if a battery chemist at Tesla ended up introducing the same chemistry at Ford, they could get in a lot of trouble.\\n\\nAlso, you're allowed to use the benefit of experience.  If you do some job for 10 years at one company, chances are you're a lot better at it after 10 years, and you don't have to pretend that you're fresh out of college at the new job.  You just can't actually borrow your previous work products at the new company (like copying source code as a programmer).\\n\\nReally though the laws for NDAs are pretty reasonable and practical.  It is non-compete agreements that tend to get a lot of abuse.

How everything fits together.\\n\\nDue to COVID-19, the Federal Government has been implementing a number of measures to save the economy, namely printing and injecting enormous amounts of cash. I get the general idea: people having more cash will stimulate the economy. Stimulus checks will alsp help people pay this months rent. \\n\\nBut from a high level, it makes no sense to me. What even is money? The whole purpose of money is to facilitate exchanges, and there is no inherent value in cash/money itself. They are just pieces of paper. \\n\\nSo even if the Fed prints all of this money, how does that actually help the situation? Obviously, I immediately see that it would help a family pay this months rent. But fundamentally, there was literally nothing done.

Person A owes person B rent, but both can't produce food due to the virus. All of the sudden, there magically appears pieces of paper (money) for person A to pay person B, so the rent problem is solved. So? They'll both die because they can't make food anymore.

On p.28 of their 2020 10k they throw shipping costs in as a fulfillment cost rather than a separate obligation.

So the fact that Class C shares of $GOOG with no voting rights are trading at a premium to Class A shares of $GOOGL with voting rights seems to imply that the addition of voting rights actually is a net negative in some way. Are there any reasons as to why this might be the case?\\n\\nMy initial inclination is that while retail investors would likely see little to no benefit from having voting rights due to holding a negligible amount of shares individually, an institutional investor would with the amount of shares that they might amass definitely derive value in being able to influence the direction of the future of the company with added voting rights. Perhaps there are legal aspects, however, to owning shares with voting rights versus shares without voting rights that have an impact?\\n\\nAnother possibility I thought of that might be responsible for the price discrepancy was a potential difference in liquidity between $GOOGL Class A shares and $GOOG Class C shares. I don\\u2019t think it would be unreasonable to assume that $GOOGL shares with voting rights would be held more by longer term investors and thus be traded less often.

This discovery, now called the [Hall\\u2013H\\u00e9roult process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall%E2%80%93H%C3%A9roult_process), is still the only process used to make aluminium (however, see also [Bayer process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_process)).  \\\"\\n\\nSo that's an intangible asset, right?  How much would you pay for that intangible asset in 1886?  Would you think the processing plant is the important part of Alcoa, or his secret recipe of smelting?  So, in a sense, if you paid $1 for that recipe in 1886, you would have $1 of goodwill on your books (roughly).\\n\\nIf you have a company that has $500 bil in cash and it generates $50bil, I would look to where that money came from...I know that interest rates are about 1%, so that's $5 bil of the return, so they are generating $45bil somewhere else.  If I paid $500bil now, I would own the whole company, could pay myself back $500bil immediately, and then still get $45 bil somehow.  That's a really good definition of an absolutely fantastic deal.

For Munger\\u2019s letters, look for Wesco annual reports/letters\", \"There are a few components to the question and I'll unpack them in pieces.\\n\\n*What are the differences between loan (receivables) sales and ABS securitization?*\\n\\nFirst, a semantic point that becomes important when we get to securitization, Loans from the perspective of a company are different than receivables. A company issuing a loan takes on liability in the form of debt to a lender. A receivable from the company's perspective represents an asset, an amount they are owed.\\n\\nThe company is able to monetize the receivable by selling it to another party, often at a discount for the immediate liquidity.\\n\\nFrom here on I will assume the company is a bank or lending institution. Companies that sell widgets won't be issuing loans and selling them whereas a bank or lender will.\\n\\nNow let's add the layer of securitization.\\n\\nAn ABS, asset-backed security, can be characterized as a basket of securities. The basket can comprise of anything really such as [credit card](https://www.cibc.com/en/about-cibc/investor-relations/debt-information/cards-ii-trust.html)s, [bank loans](https://www.naic.org/capital_markets_archive/primer_180821.pdf) (CLOs), mortgages (RMBS,MBS). All of which can be viewed as receivables from the perspective of a bank. The bank can make money in two ways, lend money out and wait until they're paid back or lend money out and sell the risk to someone else. The securitization process allows the bank to do the latter. The former, holding loans to maturity is often a poor use of the bank's balance sheet. This is because the purpose of a bank has evolved over time to be that of an intermediary and not an investor. There are certain situations where they will but I won't go over them here. Another caveat, I'm assuming large banking franchises, not sure how regional banks, coops, or credit unions operate.\\n\\n*They both move assets off balance sheet. Loan sale seems a simpler (and shorter?) process than ABS esp. if there are existing buyers for the company that is selling?*\\n\\nReceivable sales may be simpler and faster but the market it smaller. This type of sale is also known as [factoring](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/accounts-receivable-factoring/). This normally applies to widget making businesses.\\n\\nFrom the perspective of a lender, this is a little different. Loans, credit card receivables, mortgages and etc from a bank are often warehoused on the relevant banking division's balance sheet until there are sufficient loans for it to be packaged into an ABS. The capital market division will take those loans, package them, and sell them off to an institutional investor (pensions, Fidelity Fixed Income Portfolios/ETFs/MutualFunds...etc). A sufficient size, for context, will be north of 150 million. Going to caveat this with large banking franchises, not sure how coops or smaller regional banks do it. I'd imagine they act as brokers for securitization divisions at the investment banks without a commercial lending business.\\n\\n*What about other aspects? Price? Risks? Logistics? When is it good/bad for the company to use one vs. the other?*\\n\\nThis depends on the company, going back to the widget making businesses. I'd imagine if they have to factor receivables they're fully drawn on their credit lines and have very short term liabilities that cannot be met. It's also possible that the receivables are past due and the company prefers liquidity. A widget making business wouldn't really choose between one or the other. If they need to borrow they'll likely use their credit lines, and for longer-term go to their local bank and get a commercial loan. The bank will take the loan and securitize it for sale to an investor. This would all happen in the background and the widget company will be none the wiser.\\n\\nA lender only chooses to sell the receivable if they can no longer package it for sale or have an expectation that recovery is going to be too troublesome. These are normally [debt collectors](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/15/magazine/bad-paper-debt-collector.html) or distressed debt investors.\\n\\n*And is it fair to assume that if the lender sells/securitize most of its loan assets then effectively it becomes an originator and earn fees as such?*\\n\\nyes. SoFi, what started as a student lending refinance company does this. They give students money to pay their existing student debt. From the perspective of the student, they are swapping on liability with another. The student now has a loan with SoFi as the lender. SoFi loses some money but creates a loan asset that sits on their balance sheet. Once there are enough loan assets they'll sell them to [Goldman Sachs](https://www.sofi.com/press/sofi-completes-960-2-million-student-loan-securitization/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=ab338b5b71c7e62481b9850518e1ec0e7acac1c6-1590097403-0-AR37iw_9lEGIOZgV5rJF9aw6Z8Lez11BgPJ4tpaQMeS6a8jmb3CkkOyZwxQaKf_R2VGZBqs_NRFSfpvHlgRiyJQ-e0oyS2oQcP4BY76sVKCsfcthFnXPYrU8LNFIvS75wM3TR2_pykzjG3mx6SyBcaMQalIZOqa3t_qLvhv1aaBV93KE9nwJX2_zVBtkty30gfn-VXzxvtX4urFG8TfdG5N_p5AsolLZnuPZlUO2LXM-hKHYJZ2uXvy3Zb3NBs7TzlFK6KF-s9hTleD1UUq9e2ns7EuhQ1Iuw6VcTsECFOitY_XkL16mB-DozlndB3F5pci4c1q_OhM-jXBYB_q9re4S6OnRw0U7Ulg8v0LvCeLM7UKvDpnHYUvdKkPkt6R0awFd49hKrCSEvppRvjV9LLcAbhTeKpYH90Xmz9OYC5jK) to Securitize and sell off to investors. Along the way, SoFi likely charges some origination fee or they'll take a spread on the interest they charge.  Don't quote me on this as I haven't spent the time to look into their business model. Then Goldman will charge an issuance fee on the securitization, this normally gets bundled into the principal payments of the ABS. Last time I looked it was about 3% in Canada, but don't quote me on this. If you look hard enough you should be able to find the issuing docs and they'll spell out the fees the investment bank charges.  \\n\\n\\nAnother example is of Candian Tire and Scotiabank. Canadian Tire is a retailer that sells mainly home goods. They issue a branded credit card with much of the capital coming from a large Canadian bank (Scotiabank). They list the structure and update the business regularly in their [investor relations section](https://s22.q4cdn.com/405442328/files/doc_presentations/en/2019/Glacier-Investor-Presentation-September-2019.pdf).

Although I want to emphasize the passive nature of what I'm hoping to accomplish.  For example, shifting my portfolio towards bonds/equities given some evidence that one side has become expensive/cheap is something that would occur passively, i.e., instead of re-weighing my portfolio by selling shares I currently own and buying shares I want, I would only change my buying strategy.  This would make my strategy much slower and less reactionary, so that it'd probably only be effective in long time ranges.  But I agree that ultimately it's like trend investing, just that the trends would need to be very macro.\\n\\nI think this context is important since it kind of addresses your comment that normally ETFs are already diversified.  I agree, and hope to leverage this fact.  So, instead of trying to analyze any specific stock or industry, I'm looking at analyzing the US equity market as a whole and comparing it to the credit market as a whole.  This means that it's not very feasible and probably not very fruitful to analyze the underlying stocks comprising such ETFs (i.e., SPY).  For TLT, there's not even an underlying company to analyze since it's based on US treasury rates.\\n\\nSo, to me, it would seem what influences the price of ETFs like SPY or TLT is from global macroeconomic events rather than any particular company or even set of companies (to some degree), and I'd find more success in analyzing such events.  Obviously the most recent (and ongoing) example of such an event is this coronavirus situation.  The equity market took a major hit due to global events and government actions, while the Fed has been implementing economic actions which have obviously affected the credit market.\\n\\nNow, obviously the pandemic is unprecedented and I don't think anyone, with typical information on these events, can properly \\\"time\\\" any of this and consistently take optimal actions in response to it.  But, at the same time, the various government actions can be analyzed themselves and give some clue into how the future will look, at least in longer ranges of time.\\n\\nWhich leads me back to my question: where's a good place to start in terms of analyzing such events and actions in terms of how the effect broad markets in general?  I can appreciate that I'll have significantly less control over my portfolio versus someone who focuses on individual companies, but I'm only trying to improve on a naive passive portfolio rather than trying to beat the markets or anything.

Icahn long before the downturn (\\\\~2014) and a bit more in the downturn. The company trades at $6/ share and has $6 cash/share. Moreover, the company is trading at a p/b ratio of 0.5.\\n\\nAlso, I have found that the company has a cost structure of \\\\~25% fixed costs and 75% variable cost, giving it some flexibility in this downturn.\\n\\nI have had trouble understanding how the company finances its money losing operations and what these investors see in the company, as there are other competitors such as AVIS which is FCF positive and, according to the company's managers, is able to face the current situation to the end of 2020 and a bit more. Moreover, AVIS' price has decline in a similar way to HTZ \\\\~(-70%). However, AVIS has a D/E ratio of \\\\~20x while HTZ \\\\~9x.\\n\\nThe major risk/competition I have seen attributed to HTZ and AVIS is increasing competition from ride-sharing apps such as UBER/LYFT.\\n\\nHowever (on a quick analysis), some of these companies rent cars to ride-hail operators such as LYFT and UBER - they are partners of UBER and LYFT not/ or not just competitors. Moreover, before UBER existed, companies such as HERTZ and AVIS were mostly focused on renting cars for leisure (i.e. long-distance rentals for tourists) not short-distance such as UBER/LYFT.\\n\\nAs HERTZ/AVIS mostly buy the cars they lease to customers, these new partnerships with UBER and others could potentially increase their economies of scale \\\\[more bargaining power with suppliers (auto manufacturers)\\\\]. Moreover, they have another difficult to replicate point which is that they have a global presence across different airports which is hard to replicate and partnerships with hotels etc...\\n\\nConsequently, when the economy picks up again, it is unlikely that their competitive positioning will be completely eroded.\\n\\nThanks\", \"i meant something like that  [http://rnm.simon.rochester.edu/research/OSoV.pdf](http://rnm.simon.rochester.edu/research/OSoV.pdf) .

I thought it was too specific of a question for someone to take the time, so seriously thank you.\\n\\nIf I correctly understood you, all this tells me is that this valuation method is flawed. The example you proposed with borrowing $1,000 makes sense because I BORROWED $1,000. So yes, I would essentially be losing money if my cost of capital was 10%, and that $1,000 returned me 0.3%. In other words, there exists an opportunity cost of earning 10% elsewhere, so that is equivalent to me destroying value.\\n\\nHowever, the residual model is being used to value actual companies. I am not borrowing money to purchase their equity (book value). I agree that this the model would make sense if we lived in a world where the book value cannot be liquidated. Because in that case, the only thing that matters is what it is returning for me compared to my cost of capital. So even if a company had a trillion dollars in book value (but cannot be liquidated) that will return $3 next year, it's still only worth $30 to me because that's the return required to cover my cost of capital (10%), and that's the only thing I truly keep.\\n\\nBut that's not at all how it works in the real world. As a shareholder, you quite literally owner of a company's book value. If someone offered you a savings account with a trillion dollars that will return $3 next year for $30, would you take it? You obviously would, and so I still can't wrap my head around how this makes any sense. \\n\\nThanks again. Looking forward to hearing what you think.\", \"Pretty good.

Opportunity cost is a real cost, so you are in fact destroying value if you invest suboptimally. \\n\\nI think the big takeaway here is that the model makes the assumption that the companies are, as you said, going concerns. Whatever is in the \\\"BV\\\" is locked up. In that case, yes, I agree. The initial BV then doesn't matter since you can't \\\"cash out\\\", so the company's value is only derived insofar as how much it'll return for your capital. A trillion dollars in BV returning $3 is \\\"worth\\\" only $30 because I can't do anything because I can't liquidate. \\n\\nI still think that the model is flawed. In my opinion, models are only great insofar as how well it fits into reality. The fact that it is going to value the trillion dollar BV company at $30 makes no sense because in reality, someone will come in and liquidate. Book value does matter because that's what you literally own as a shareholder. \\n\\nNow I get that in most situations, shareholders can't liquidate immediately, so it'd be inaccurate to assign complete value to the BV. But I still think that's hell of a lot closer than what the model would suggest. \\n\\nLet's consider the example again. A trillion dollar BV company returning $3 per year. For further simplify, let's assume all of the BV is in pure cash. The model will calculate its value at $30.\\n\\nTwo ways to think about this. Pretend that this company really exists in the real world.\\n\\n1) The company is a going concern, and shareholders usually can't liquidate whenever they want to. Therefore, the only thing that matters is the percentage return, so $30 is the correct value. \\n\\n2) The shareholders legally own a trillion dollars in book value now. Therefore, the actual value would be the BV (trillion) + $30. Therefore, even if the company is trading for say, half a trillion dollars, it makes sense to purchase it. As a shareholder, you expect its market value to eventually align with reality. \\n\\nNow, I get that the actual value is probably less than BV (trillion) + $30 because it will take time for the market to align. But I am of the contention that 2) calculates the company's value much, much closer than 1). \\n\\nLogically speaking, which method makes more sense to you if this happened in real life? 2) makes much, much more sense. \\n\\nTherefore, I would propose that the model is only used when it calculates a value greater than BV. If not, the floor should be \\\"capped\\\" at BV at most.\\n\\nAnd since we're on the topic, I'd love to get your thoughts on the idea on required return / cost of capital vs risk. I can't quite reconcile equating cost of capital and required return. \\n\\nI get the underlying reasoning. Your required return, at minimum, should be at least the cost of capital because that's supposed to be your opportunity cost. If I could have gotten 10% elsewhere, my \\\"cost\\\" is 10%, so my required return better be at least 10%. \\n\\nThis logic is crystal clear to me when we consider risk free returns i.e. your required return should at LEAST be whatever the risk free rate is. But when we add in risk, it gets a bit hazy for me. \\n\\nLet's say I have a risky company, so I arbitrarily set my required return at 20%. Is that really my cost of capital though? I guess it COULD be, but that makes the grand assumption I could have made 20% elsewhere with similar risk. That is impossible to know, so it is my view that equating the definitions of \\\"cost of capital\\\" and \\\"required return\\\" is inaccurate once we factor in risk. Sure, it's my required return based on my subjective assessment of risk vs reward, but in no way it is necessarily my cost of capital, I'd never know unless I was God.\", \"Right. Let's say there is not stock option exercised line item in the statement. \\n\\nBut in the notes there us information regarding PSU's and RSU's exercised/vested.

The 62-year-old titan of the $3.2tn global hedge fund industry predicted the downfall of US energy giant Enron almost two decades ago, making a fortune in the process. But the course of true riches, it seems, never did run smooth. On the day of our encounter, Tesla, which Chanos has bet against for the past five years, overtakes Toyota as the most valuable carmaker in the world, leaving him nursing heavy losses. But more about that later.\\n\\n\\nI am ensconced at Oswald\\u2019s, an elegant London members\\u2019 club for oenophiles. It\\u2019s the first time I\\u2019ve set foot in a restaurant in four months. But where more appropriate to interview the short-seller than an antique mirrored dining room in Mayfair, the heart of the European hedge fund industry? It\\u2019s three days before \\u201cSuper Saturday\\u201d, when London\\u2019s restaurants and bars can reopen. I\\u2019ve been granted an exception and am the sole diner. Social distancing would not be a problem here, however. The round tables are generously spaced apart, designed with discretion in mind.\\n\\n\\nI am to have early dinner \\u2014 Chanos is to have lunch. He is in Miami Beach, where he has been stuck since the start of lockdown in early March. For our encounter, he has persuaded Prime 112 steakhouse, his go-to place on Friday nights, to allow him to use its private room. When he comes on screen, his air is more benevolent academic than pantomime villain, dressed in a white open-necked shirt and blazer. Chanos likes to present himself as a \\u201creal-time financial detective who is incentivised to root out fraud\\u201d. Or, more prosaically, a \\u201cforensic financial statement junkie\\u201d.\\n\\n\\nTo critics, short selling represents the scourge of modern capitalism. Whereas so-called value investors such as Warren Buffett try to buy shares in companies that the market is underestimating, short-sellers such as Chanos seek out overvalued companies. They borrow shares and then sell them, hoping to buy them back later for less. In short, \\u201cthey are profiting when others are losing money\\u201d, says Chanos \\u2014 and this makes some people uncomfortable.\\n\\n\\nChanos is buoyant. A week earlier, one of his largest short positions \\u2014 the German payments company Wirecard \\u2014 filed for bankruptcy, after admitting that \\u20ac1.9bn of its cash probably did \\u201cnot exist\\u201d. This followed a five-year FT investigation into its accounting practices. Chanos\\u2019s funds made almost $100m from the trade, according to an investor. He laughs: \\u201cIt\\u2019s bittersweet, Harriet, because short-sellers put up with weeks and months of misery, and you feel good for hours and days.\\u201d\\n\\n\\nEven its detractors acknowledge that short selling, in a normal environment, helps the markets to question conventional wisdom. But a sharper complaint, usually heard from targets, is that short-sellers acting together to sow FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) about a company\\u2019s accounting or financial position can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. In the past, investors such as Chanos have moved markets just by revealing a bet against a particular company.\\n\\n\\nIt\\u2019s bittersweet\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009Short-sellers put up with weeks and months of misery, and you feel good for hours and days\\n\\n\\nChanos happily concedes that he talks frequently to other short-sellers. He shorted Luckin Coffee, once touted as China\\u2019s answer to Starbucks, after Carson Block of Muddy Waters encouraged him to look at it. (The company is now being investigated for accounting fraud.) But it\\u2019s \\u201ca myth\\u201d that short-sellers act together, he tells me from Prime 112\\u2019s private room. \\u201cIf there were conspiracies, we\\u2019d be in something much more profitable than short selling.\\u201d\\n\\n\\nI mention Canadian insurer Fairfax Financial. It sued a group of hedge funds, including those run by Chanos, Dan Loeb and Steve Cohen, for allegedly driving down its stock under a short selling scheme. \\u201cThat was the perception, but it wasn\\u2019t true,\\u201d says Chanos. \\u201cThe case was thrown out [in 2018] on jurisdictional grounds. Our allegation was that the company was overstating their earnings, and during the process they restated their earnings.\\u201d\\n\\n\\nChanos\\u2019s hedge fund manager Kynikos Associates is named after the ancient Greek word for \\u201ccynic\\u201d. His pitch is that he can identify corporate disasters-in-the-making. The New York-based outfit employs 20 people and has $1.5bn in assets under management. Chanos also teaches a course on the history of financial fraud (\\u201chow to detect it, not how to commit it\\u201d, he quips) at Yale University, his alma mater. The syllabus stretches back to the 17th century. Today, he says, \\u201cwe are in the golden age of fraud\\u201d.\\n\\nChanos describes the current environment as \\u201ca really fertile field for people to play fast and loose with the truth, and for corporate wrongdoers to get away with it for a long time\\u201d. He reels off why: a 10-year bull market driven by central bank intervention; a level of retail participation in the markets reminiscent of the end of the dotcom boom; Trumpian \\u201cpost-truth in politics, where my facts are your fake news\\u201d; and Silicon Valley\\u2019s \\u201cfake it until you make it\\u201d culture, which is compounded by Fomo \\u2014 the fear of missing out. All of this is exacerbated by lax oversight. Financial regulators and law enforcement, he says, \\u201care the financial archaeologists \\u2014 they will tell you after the company has collapsed what the problem was.\\u201d\\n\\n\\nAll in all, it\\u2019s \\u201ca heady witch\\u2019s brew for trouble\\u201d.\", \"I\\u2019d like to kindly remind investors on three crucial points:\\n1) Chanos is long an index and short individual constituents\\n2) The FED can stay irrational longer than you can stay liquid\\n3) Long post do not equal good posts.\\n\\nLast point can be expanded on with one of my favorite quotes: \\u201cI can write concise, but sometimes I get lazy and keep on writing.\\u201d\", \"So Chanos is right. But there's plenty of slack left in the system. Without writing some massive comment, I'll just quickly point out the obvious. The next stage of monetary policy is what I would consider a primary indicator of such a catalyst. I guess the demand side has technically already started with the so called stimulus checks, but for some reason it feel incongruous.   I mean it seems apparent now that we're likely to see an extended period of stagflation, which many predicted.\", \"~~Wallstreet~~ Fraudstreet. Yea, we know.\", \"Yes sir.\", \"It'll get flagged if somebody were to copy and paste, plus there's a graph. See PDF of page [here](https://www.docdroid.net/UlaFuWT/jim-chanos-we-are-in-the-golden-age-of-fraud-financial-times-pdf).\", \"Chanos\\u2019s mission is focused on understanding a company\\u2019s business model and then ascertaining if its financial statements reflect it. Certain themes crop up time and again in his hunt for short positions: technological obsolescence, consumer fads, single-product companies, growth via acquisitions and accounting games. Notably he looks for \\u201clegal fraud\\u201d \\u2014 where companies adhere to the accounting rules and regulations but there\\u2019s still an \\u201cintent to deceive\\u201d. Enron epitomised this \\u2014 Chanos identified that it was using aggressive accounting to front-load profits and hide debt in its subsidiaries.\\n\\n\\nHe wasn\\u2019t the first short-seller to the Wirecard party. Chanos initiated a short in the German payments company last year and increased the position last autumn, when the FT published documents indicating that profits at Wirecard units in Dubai and Dublin were fraudulently inflated and that customers listed in documents provided to auditor EY did not exist.\\n\\n\\nWirecard\\u2019s collapse, when it finally came, was dramatic. But, says Chanos, most fraud is on the edges. And these days, often it is \\u201cstaring at you right in the face through the use of company-designed metrics\\u201d through which they are \\u201cgaming the system\\u201d. He is referring to creative accounting measures used to flatter companies\\u2019 books, notably office-space provider WeWork\\u2019s now infamous community-adjusted ebitda. The coronavirus crisis has spawned \\u201cebitdac\\u201d, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortisation \\u2014 and coronavirus \\u2014 where companies are adding back profits they say they would have made but for the pandemic.\\n\\n\\nRegulators, he says, could be much firmer in clamping down on metrics \\u201cthat just are increasingly unmooring themselves from reality\\u201d.\\n\\n\\nGrowing up as the son of Greek and Irish immigrants who ran a chain of dry-cleaning shops in Milwaukee, Chanos says he was interested in stock markets at an early age. After Yale, he worked for an investment bank in Chicago and then retail brokerage Gilford Securities, where he began writing research on individual stocks. He had a baptism by fire: \\u201cThe first major company I looked at and wrote up turned out to be an immense accounting fraud.\\u201d\\n\\n\\nBaldwin-United was a piano company that had morphed into a financial supermarket. Chanos\\u2019s research pointed out inconsistencies with its numbers and recommended that investors sell the stock. It went bankrupt the following year, in 1983, at the time the largest-ever US corporate bankruptcy. Baldwin\\u2019s collapse piqued the interest of Gilford\\u2019s hedge fund clients who followed its stock recommendations, notably George Soros and Michael Steinhardt. \\u201cWhat else does the kid not like?\\u201d they asked, Chanos recalls.\\n\\n\\nSoon afterwards, he joined Deutsche Bank in New York. It was a shortlived affair. In September 1985, The Wall Street Journal ran a front-page investigation into the \\u201caggressive methods\\u201d of a network of short-sellers that it alleged was driving down the shares of US companies. The then 27-year-old Chanos was portrayed as an enfant terrible at the centre of the network. \\u201cPeople think I have two horns and spread syphilis,\\u201d he quipped in the article. Deutsche fired him and his boss. \\u201cThe postscript is that nine of the 10 companies mentioned [in the article] either went bankrupt or were prosecuted for fraud,\\u201d he says.\\n\\n\\nJim Chanos pockets $100m from Wirecard short\\nChanos\\u2019s wedge salad and my own starter (a plate of oysters, deliciously juicy, with a glass of crisp white Burgundy) arrive.\\n\\n\\nIt must take a certain personality type to be a perma-bear, I venture.\\n\\n\\nA long time ago, Chanos believed that going short was just \\u201cthe mirror image of going long\\u201d. He has changed his tune on this, however, \\u201cbecause there is a lot of behavioural finance at work in the markets\\u201d. On Wall Street, he says, \\u201cthe bull case is everywhere\\u201d \\u2014 optimistic management projections, takeover rumours that boost targets\\u2019 stock prices, and company earnings estimates revised upwards.\\n\\n\\n\\u201cSo I think that it does take a certain peculiar personality \\u2014 and I\\u2019ll leave it at that \\u2014 to say \\u2018OK, here\\u2019s my facts and here\\u2019s the conclusions I draw from my facts, and that\\u2019s why I think there\\u2019s an opportunity on the short side here.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\n\\nMany can\\u2019t stomach it. Less than a year after the 1985 launch of Kynikos \\u2014 amid \\u201cthe rip-roaring bull market\\u201d of the time \\u2014 Chanos\\u2019s business partner declared that he wasn\\u2019t comfortable with the pure short selling side of the business. He said his accountant had advised him to sell back his stake to Chanos for a nominal amount of $1. \\u201cAnd I paid him right there on the spot out of my wallet,\\u201d says Chanos. \\u201cIt was the greatest trade I think I ever did,\\u201d he adds with a chuckle.\\n\\n\\nChanos has put the remains of his salad to one side to make way for the steak. I\\u2019m delighted by my main course: deep red toro tuna carpaccio, garnished with avocado mousse.\\n\\n\\nMy guest has one of the best track records in the hedge fund industry. The Kynikos Capital Partners fund, a long/short equity strategy, has gained 22 per cent a year on average over the past 35 years \\u2014 double that of the S&P 500 index. In the same period, against the backdrop of rising equity markets, its US short-only Ursus strategy \\u2014 named after the Latin for \\u201cbear\\u201d \\u2014 has lost 2 per cent a year.\\n\\n\\nKynikos performance chart against the S&P 500 \\nThe past decade has been a difficult one for short-sellers in general, as trillions of dollars of central bank stimulus have lifted prices of assets indiscriminately across the board. How do you trade that? \\u201cVery carefully and painfully,\\u201d he says.\\n\\n\\nFundraising has been tough. Kynikos\\u2019s assets peaked at around $7bn after 2008, when short-only Ursus gained 44 per cent, net of fees. They have slumped to $1.5bn since then. This year Chanos sold a minority stake in the management company to boutique investment firm Conlon & Co and the family office of Richard M Daley, former mayor of Chicago.\\n\\n\\nProlonged periods of quantitative easing \\u2014 most recently to ease the economic pain of the coronavirus crisis \\u2014 is \\u201cadding to inequality\\u201d by benefiting the people who own financial assets, says Chanos. He believes that the Federal Reserve ought to cut credit card rates for consumers, which are still 15-18 per cent in the US, and sees a potential political backlash against the central banks for their part in how \\u201cthe rich have gotten much richer and the vast majority of people have not\\u201d.\\n\\n\\nWould you like to see how James Ferguson draws his marvellous Lunch with the FT illustrations?

For more information on our online extravaganza of big debates, specially commissioned live performances and to purchase a festival pass visit: ftweekendfestival.com\\n\\n\\nPolitical risk is one of the reasons that Chanos is shorting gig economy comp\\u00adanies such as ride-hailing apps Uber and Lyft and online food-delivery platforms Grubhub and Just Eat Takeaway. Not only are they losing money, but he believes that there is going to be a greater political focus on low-wage workers, which poses an existential threat to their business models.\\n\\n\\nChanos sits on the finance committee of US presidential hopeful Joe Biden, who is supporting a new California law to strengthen legal protections for gig economy workers. A Biden administration raises the prospect of higher taxes. \\u201cI think it\\u2019s fair that rates of taxation on capital probably should go up, relative to rates of taxation on earned income. I know that makes me a communist on Wall Street but I\\u2019ve always felt that.\\u201d\\n\\n\\nChanos declines a second glass of wine, joking that \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to be drunk for this.\\u201d Defeated by his huge steak and salad, he asks the waiter to put them in a doggy bag. On my encouragement, he decides to be a good sport and orders the \\u201cdecadent\\u201d fried Oreos that the restaurant is famous for. My own dessert is a coconut choc ice.\\n\\n\\nI return to the subject of Tesla, whose shares have surged around six-fold in the five years since Chanos began shorting the company. What is going on here? \\u201cI think Elon Musk has personified the hopes and dreams of this bull market,\\u201d he says, setting out his bear case against Tesla, which he sees as unprofitable, highly leveraged and facing increasing competition.

Not exactly a controversial view right now. I was pointing out that despite running out of rope in terms of interest rates, and then QE, and then QE on  steroids, I'm looking for the next phase of MP, namely on the demand side, as primary indicator that impotence has arrived. At that point the next crash, after paving over and paving over, what you'll get is a massive sinkhole instead. I was also just pointing out that while yes, they have already gone down that road in terms of the so called stimulus checks, I don't really consider this included just because of circumstance. I expect it'll happen on a much larger scale as authorities grasp at straws. And in the US where market fundamentalism, particularly supply side,  is basically the state religion shifting to a demand side heavy approach is a solid indicator of desperation and the end of the line. Then I was merely commenting on the shorter term, which seems quite apparent with stagflation, but all that is still playing out in real time. We didn't and still don't know exactly how the pandemic is going to pan out. If the thing had just vanished already the economy would have been strongly overheated, but it's actually gone on longer that expected so now we're stretched, hence more so called stimulus on the way. That's basically the long and short of it. After this near term reflation, it's pretty obvious the market is going to move sideways or negative and likely stay that way for a while, hence stagflation, particularly if Trump's tax plan is revoked. What I'm saying is, they have another rabbit they can pull out of that hat. But after that, that's all she wrote folks. As it pertains to Chanos and shorts. The post 2009 environment is the worst possible scenario and it just got put on steroids. So of course when you have effectively negative rates, just think about it like when oil went negative, they theoretically had to pay to get the oil off their hands, that's the situation with money in that kind of environment, so it's not a surprise when you see the massive lets just be polite and say misallocation of capital. What Chanos is doing either takes some real conviction or perhaps some real insanity in a monetary environment like this. Especially with some of the lets say better known among his short positions. You combine ESG and basically fighting the fed, that's probably not going to end well, and it hasn't.

In the US the corporates get the cake and eat it too. They get similar loan/grants like EU, but they still laid off the workers. That's very bullish.

TSMC is crushing them on process, capacity, and has no strategic incentive to help Intel until they're much weaker.

Because it's online, I naturally would want it to expand it beyond my school hence this post.\\n\\nIf a person can understand the moats of a company or lack thereof, how they make money and how solid/protected are their revenue streams, the direction is the company going in, any obstacles and risks they may face, and a reasonable price to buy its shares, then its reasonable to say they understand the business and can make an informed decision on whether or not they want to invest in the company or not. \\n\\nThis framework isn't meant to turn people into investment gurus or anything but people who are interested in investing should be able to actively participate in the research process and share that with each other. I just want to point them in a direction that could help them start the research process. By having a framework, it will force them to understand the business and therefore hedge against their emotions amidst the day-to-day volatility of the stock market and just focus on investing strong companies with durable moats for long periods of time.

At the same time, the Government in the United States is taking a confrontational stance towards China both legislatively and economically as it negotiates the political and economic reality of China's burgeoning superpower status.\\n\\nThese two facts suggest that the period of relatively close economic ties enjoyed by China and the US may be coming to a close. In my view, this may have an effect on neighbouring countries in East and South Asia, who may benefit from an uptick in demand for manufacturing and other services from the USA. Whether this demand can be capitalized upon depends on if the construction and creation of infrastructure and regulatory structures can be implemented effectively in those countries. China, in its' current position as a transitioning economy, may outsource a part of its' domestic production to Africa, an area of the world where it has significant financial interest, and may attempt to transition to a service-based economy serving it's growing middle and upper classes by reducing its' reliance on the manufacturing sector.\\n\\nRegarding issues such as social unrest, political instability and COVID-19, it's my unfortunate view that China is in many ways more adequately equipped to counter these threats than the USA. China has a very extensive and pervasive system of state control and surveillance, both economically and socially, which enables it to be very decisive with its' policy creation. The Chinese people are also generally patriotic and fairly nationalistic, preferring a 'strong' China with a resolute leader to a free and democratic China. The Chinese Government has an easier time enacting policy, and has an easier time convincing its' people to obey and support that policy - this is useful, for example, for enforcing the wearing of masks and social distancing. It also has more effective means of surveillance and a less accountable police force and legal system, which makes the suppression of political dissidents less cumbersome than in the USA, where principles of fairness and justice come before the well-being of the State.\\n\\nThere's also the issue of military aggression from the Chinese side, against India on the border and against their disputed territories in the South China Sea. Tensions flaring in these regions, as well as the presence of Chinese neo-colonialism in Africa, indicates China's desire to spread both its' physical borders and its' political and financial influence independently of the USA. This may have the effect of dividing political and financial allegiances globally between the USA and China, as countries weigh up their options and decide which global superpower offers them the most in exchange for the least.\", \"I think it's awesome actually.

The idea that one should receive a superior reward for a superior contribution is called meritocracy, and it's not an idea I find too much fault with if I'm to be honest. If we were all exactly the same, with the same assets and the same net worth, why would anybody try to excel, to innovate, to stand out? It's one of the problems they faced in the Soviet Union - how do you inspire people to excel and innovate, if those innovations are not rewarded? There's also the risk and reward argument, which states that we should demand greater compensation for taking more risk. Since any entrepreneurial venture is risky by its' nature, those undertaking entrepreneurial ventures must be motivated by the prospect of greater reward. Why would any rational person take the risk of innovating - that is, taking the risk of losing everything to advance humanity - if they were offered no reward for this undertaking?

They are unimaginative and bound by ideological rigidities. The domestic political trend of the US is toward becoming a Latin American style country. This country will not be structurally capable of competing with China.\", \"I think you're going to see more supply chain diversification in other low-cost labor countries rather than a manufacturing return to the US\", \"You have to consider, why is so much manufacturing being done in China right now. Why not India? Why not African countries? Many of these other countries have much lower prevailing wages than China.\\n\\nThere are many costs, because there are many inputs to manufacturing. Labor is simply one input, and it is an increasingly minor input in manufacturing. Depending on the particular product, the cost of capital, energy, logistics, and supply chains can be much more decisive than labor costs. \\n\\nChina is low cost because of a combination of many factors. Chinese labor is no longer cheap, but it is comparable in quality to that of developed countries while being cheaper than developed countries. Eastern China has better infrastructure than most developed countries, this gives Chinese manufacturers some of the lowest logistic costs in the world. China has a domestic abundance of capital and savings, this gives China a massive cost of capital advantage over every other developing country. An example of this is the Shanghai Gigafactory. The government of Shanghai was able to finance most of the factory and offer Tesla a turnkey factory without any up front capital investment from Tesla. Most developing countries that have to pay a cost of capital >6-10% can't afford to do this.\\n\\nThe really major one is supply chain costs. If you manufacture in India, but all your component inputs still have to be imported from China, you will incur higher supply chain risk and cost which will eat into your labor cost savings. Attempting to replicate the supply chain locally will require massive up front capital investment, and India has a much higher cost of capital than China.\\n\\nIn practice what this means is that China can manufacture things for cheaper than countries with far lower wages. Chinese products can undersell African producers with wages that are 1/5 of prevailing Chinese wages due to the greater internal supply efficiency in China. A worker in Senegal that makes $100/month isn't as cost efficient as a worker in China that makes $700/month.\\n\\nChina's high savings rate and cheap capital means that China can upgrade its capital stock far more cheaply than poorer countries. The rise of automation actually makes Chinese manufacturers more competitive relative to poorer developing countries. At the same time, the size of the internal supply chain makes China more competitive than smaller countries with less population. The cost of labor makes China more competitive than developed countries with higher wages.\\n\\nIt is a combination of these factors that makes Chinese factories sit at the sweet spot of factors that give them the lowest production costs across a very wide range of manufactured products. Moving manufacturing out of China will mean giving up many of these advantages. Diversifying supply chains across countries increases risk and cost. For example, during the COVID-19 crisis, cross border movement of people was shut down. Many factories in Vietnam rely on access to Chinese managers and technicians to function. With borders shut down, these people can't go to Vietnam, so the Vietnamese factories had to shutdown and the orders had to be given to factories in China. Every time you cross a national border, you are subject to an extra layer of border controls, customs, tariffs, and political risk. These all add to the cost of the final product.\\n\\nWhat is really special about China is that it has a work force that is larger than the previously industrialized world put together, so it is able to absorb a massive number of different types of manufacturing because it has enough workers. When you put all these different types of manufacturing in the same country, it drastically cuts the frictional costs of combining the outputs of these intermediate producers. The only other country with comparable work force size is India, but India internally does not all speak the same language. India has 22 official languages internally, and the largest one, Hindi, is spoken only by 43% of the population. So in practice, even India can't match the economy of scale of China, since no single language community within India has the scale to compete with the Mandarin speaking population of China.\\n\\nThe more technically sophisticated manufacturing becomes, the more important the size of your language community. You need to be able to communicate increasingly sophisticated technical concepts effectively with a wide network of suppliers, and doing so across a language barrier sharply reduces communication efficiency.\", \"China used to subsidize production industry.

The best we can do is predict 1 generation ahead.\\n\\nThe main cause of low fertility in China in the present generation is compressed urbanization.

Urban cost of living is far higher than rural cost of living, so this suppresses fertility among first generation \\\"immigrants\\\".\\n\\nThis will likely change in subsequent generations. Those who are too poor to get married won't have kids. Those who have kids generally only have one. Their kids will inherit a ton of assets from the accumulation of the previous generation. When 2 people who are only children get married, they inherit the combined assets of both families. This wealth will enable them to start families much earlier and have more children than their parents generation.\\n\\nI expect Chinese population demographic trends to reverse in about 20 years due to this wealth effect. The rate of wealth accumulation right now in Chinese families is extremely rapid due to the 4-2-1 family structure.\\n\\nIn both China and US, realized fertility is lower than desired fertility. The main constraint is financial. Many women cannot afford to have as many children as they want due to financial constraints.

China could have permitted foreigners to leave while preventing its own nationals from leaving, and that would have done a great deal to slow the initial spread out of Wuhan.\\n\\nAt the very least, China could have been open that there was extreme risk on flights coming from Wuhan to international destinations, which was clearly its assessment given that it banned those flights internally. If other nations had known how wild the pandemic was in Wuhan, and that China had stopped internal travel, they would have had more information to justify applying strict quarantines to incoming flights from Wuhan. If they did, much spread would have been prevented.\\n\\nIn fairness, in mid January our countries were still mostly up our own asses at that point over how \\\"racist\\\" travel restrictions were, so it's not clear that China's being open would have been effective given that Western countries might have chosen to not apply blanket quarantines.

Explanatory power goes to the social sciences, perhaps the usual stress-induced sexual activity hearkening back to the human impulse to have more children during bad times, like famines, human emotions and anxiety within individuals don't differentiate the severity in absolute terms across history.

In many developed countries, the cost of daycare for 2 children will equal the median income for women. The cost of housing requires 2 incomes to finance a family home. This is a sign of poverty rather than wealth.\\n\\nMany middle class in developed countries are extremely time poor, and raising children is a time intensive activity. They are wealthy enough to afford material goods, but they are not wealthy enough to pay the time opportunity costs of raising children.\\n\\nFertility rates will bounce back when average people have lots of free time and energy to do whatever they want.

Ambani achieved what he achieved, most likely, through corruption. All of the stuff he did wasn't possible for other providers (for example, carrying voice over data) because Ambani paid people off.\\n\\nWhat Ambani did also wasn't some tech masterstroke, it was a function of the high levels of regulation in India (and his unique ability to ignore those regulations). All of the voice over data stuff occurs everywhere, in most countries (afaik) the issue is regulatory because there tends to have been a monopoly provider who owns exchanges/copper so voice over data is less about cheaper hardware but less friction (in most cases, your traffic is still going through those copper wires to an exchange...you just don't need to pay all the ludicrous \\\"line rental\\\" charges). The big issue in many countries is access. These services are mainly marketed to business but there is a concern about whether all retail customers will be able to use this service (where I am, the monopoly infrastructure provider is moving 100% to voice over data).\\n\\n(Also, the article says that the govt generated revenue from this...no, they lost revenue because of the way providers pay the govt in India).\\n\\nThe other big \\\"innovation\\\" (again, not really) in this space is internet over mobile.

All the backhaul stuff is basically unchanged. I have never found any of this to be that interesting tbh. It is a race to the bottom, and these companies are really just innovating in marketing...that is it (and backhaul fibre generally hasn't been a good investment, towers have because the economics are different).\\n\\nAlso, the point of the article really isn't about Jio but the splintering of the internet. This is definitely happening but it isn't really black and white. EU data protection rules really aren't some onerous threat to innovation...like it is your data, and you should be allowed to choose whether another company sells that data.

Airtel's biggest strengths are:\\n\\n1. Significant % of urban Indian elite are with Airtel and though that number is shrinking, it has not alarming.\\n2. Again in the B2B context, Airtel has a much better market share than Airtel and from what I know they are focusing on building a better B2B internet app ecosystem, unlike Jio which has a stronger B2C app ecosystem. While Airtel does have a good consumer app ecosystem, it is not easily understood as Hike, Wynk stand as independent units and not do brandish Airtel brand.\\n3. Airtel has better partnerships with global telcos unlike Jio with their top brass having done significant stints at British, Australian, and Singapore telcos.\\n4. Airtel is a market leader in many African countries too where they seem to be attempting the Jio model.\\n\\nBeyond this, Airtel makes a great partner for Amazon to counter JioRetail and Airtel's B2B ecosystem to complement the AWS suite. Previously the Softbank group had invested in Airtel Africa and there were rumors of an investment in Airtel India too. It does not seem coincidental that Airtel's 5G partner Ericcson is the same as Softbank's 5G cloud vendor. \\n\\nI am not an expert, just someone who has made some observations.  \\nTL;DR Jio is not a monopoly yet and might see some significant competition but so far, Jio seems to be much more ambitious and well equipped.\", \"My understanding is it will be better for backhaul as opposed to direct user access, but maybe that will differ by region.

In that respect, I suspect recent rulings are more an attempt to get around the law to disrupt US corporate hegemons rather than to \\\"advance\\\" EU citizens rights.\\n\\nThe article also ignores an up and coming sector- Africa.

But value stocks should benefit from lower rates in the same model.\", \"I guess we'll see. I think Wells Fargo's deposits have risen each year for like 100 years, with a few exceptions. Maybe this will be the turning of the tide.\", \"They do for now, but I think the inherent problem with things like Netflix is how low the switching costs are. There's no contracts like cable TV (though, this can admittedly be switched), and it's hard not to imagine someone makes something that allows you to share/switch memberships easier so you can easily access more content. Maybe everyone ends up owning subscriptions to several streaming services due to laziness, but the only way that happens is if they remain 'cost effective' which takes away the upside from raising prices. \\n\\nI think operational data is overstated. It seems pretty common when you talk to VCs/people in the industry that the value of data isn't as great as you'd hope. The first 10% gives you enough to understand the customer.\\n\\nMaybe engineering and culture won't be replicated, but I'm not sure that can offset what seems like an ok/decent business vs an amazing business. I'm not saying Netflix won't exist in 10 years - I just don't see why it earns the multiple it does vs. something like Disney.\", \"Quick question:  How do you think Netflix is currently valuing its non-current content assets?\", \"No, now you're changing your argument. You originally stated that his argument could be refuted because index ETFs returned a positive CAGR over the past 20 years. I responded by pointing out that that's a false comparison because it completely misses the point the author was originally trying to make.\", \"Any.

My portfolio is posted on my profile if you're curious what I hold.\", \"not if their earnings are front loaded and declining.\", \"Do a simple 10 year before terminal growth valuation and you'll see how sensitive growth stocks are to lower interest rates. If memory serves me correctly, assume terminal growth of 4%, a drop of WACC from 9% to 8% increases npv of a company growing at 20% pa by 30%. By contrast, that effect on a company that has 5% pa growth is just 10 - 15%.\", \"The second argument was in support of the first. Namely, etfs are okay to be used because it smooths out issues with selection effects and just pure randomness of companies being good or bad. No one expected IBM, or Intel to be as inept as they ended up being. \\n\\nI also pointed out that there might be a Gettier problem occurring cause PE is a really bad metric to use. As I said in the first post no one is going to disagree that you should be wary in the price you pay.\", \"It's still yes because lower rate means higher NPV. And since when did value mean declining or distressed business? But of course, you are right if you never say yes.\", \">and I agree on growth stocks being affected more\", \"The fact that ETFs smooth out selection effects and the randomness of companies being \\\"good\\\" or \\\"bad\\\" is exactly why they aren't a good comparison metric. If you had an ETF of, say, **only** companies that were trading above a 100x PE multiple and didn't re-balance when companies were de-listed or acquired (SM by ORCL for ex.), then I think you'd have a good comparison. \\n\\nBy using SPY or QQQ, you're including companies with price-earning multiples below the threshold set by the author, which is why I said it isn't comparable - because he is very specifically **not** talking about these firms. \\n\\nWhether P/E is a good measurement to use when valuing a firm is irrelevant, since in this case we're only concerned with P/E. \\n\\nAlso, the fact that IBM & and INTC performed as poorly as they did directly supports the author's argument - namely, that the companies were unable to generate sufficient returns (growth) to meet the expectations of investors.\\n\\nThe companies were as expensive as they were because investors were front-loading expected future growth by bidding up the price. Unfortunately, they weren't able to meet investors' expectations.\", \"This is a really good point, thanks for clarifying. Basically saying an index isn\\u2019t the same as a stock pick.

Leader in the enterprise area as a cloud-service provider, team communications provider, Office 365, data analysis and BI facilities. Missing AI component, but their business is well diversified and very steady. International exposure.\\n* AAPL - until revolution in smartphones (like NeuraLink or any other interface which will remove smartphones at all) very decent business. 5G is coming, a diversified business, large pile of the cash in the pocket. Apple Music is eating Spotify pie, new SE & iPhone 12 should be a best-seller during X-Mas time. International exposure.\\n* V - leader in the world of payments, slowly entering the crypto area, and its balance-sheet a bit better than Mastercard. In general both are good choices. The only issue is that for Visa default currency is USD, while for MA - EUR, and USD might be weakier soon.\\n* INTC - leader in the retail chipset area, right now controls almost the entire CPU area.\\n* NVDA - one of the few \\\"growth\\\" stocks here. Its P/E is very high, but low leverage, impressive P/S and amazing return on employed capital is making the day. NVDA is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI industry coming, as well as auto-pilot vehicles.\\n* CTXS - ok, there is another growth company. Citrix provides capabilities to work from home without buying dedicated hardware. It means you don't need to buy everyone a corporate laptop to enable them to safely join from home. It is held by top index funds, and attracts a lot of S&P 500 clients, who have high hopes in them.\\n* BABA - yes, not the AMZN. BABA right now is extremely undervalued. They look absolutely amazing in every financial aspect, and thanks to extreme digitalisation of Asia, their revenue is growing super fast.\\n* NKE - from one hand this is a consumer cyclical company, but from another - very strong brand. Their online shopping presens is huge, as well as exposure to a world market including China. I might assume they will stay around for a while thanks to the new trend of being healthy.\\n* ACN - top IT consulting company, basically working for every Fortune 500 company. Right now I see 3 factors they will keep growing. At first, companies needed expertise to migrate to new cloud infrastructure. At seconds, companies will reduce their hiring budget for a while, but will instead hire external resources more intensively. At third, ACN made few acquisitions in the cyber-security area.\\n* (Disclaimer: I had worked for EPAM for 5 years and might be biased)  EPAM - one of the faster growing IT services companies in the world. They have a very strong expertise in almost every area, like integration of complex IT solutions, cloud migrations, online shopping, etc. I see them a long term winner of the current setup. Also they start expansion to the Asia market.\\n* CIEN - another long-term winner of working from home setup providing hardware configurations for organizing IT servers, clusters, telecommunications, etc.\\n* LDOS - one more IT services company but working in the aerospace & defense area with governments. One of the key vendors in the area of COVID-19 tracking facilities and digitalisation of government infrastructure to control COVID-19. Currently holds a portfolio of almost $30 bln agreements.\\n* AVGO - another 5G chipset producer winner. Very solid diversified portfolio, good fundamentals.\\n* TSM - semiconductor manufacturer, one the largest in the world. Produces chipsets for NVDA, INTC, AVGO, AMD and others. In my opinion, if I bet on the chipset industry it would be weird to not bet on TSM who is located in COVID-19 free area now and also has clients not only from the USA.\\n* LRCX - yet another semiconductor company, but this time a leader in the area of automatisation of production lines. They produce solutions which help to automate facilities - the thing most factories will look into to reduce risk of COVID or any other pandemic.\\n* MRK - one of the biggest healthcare companies. While everyone is watching Moderna, MRK also participates in the race for COVID-19 vaccine and has a very decent fundamentals and portfolio of products.\\n* REGN - innovative bio healthcare company, their financial and earnings are skyrocketing with a huge potential to grow.\\n* ROG - Swiss based healthcare company, very strong portfolio and financials\\n* BAYN - I am not a super big fan of Bayer, but they are definitely undervalued now due to all PR recent PR issues. Expect to grow 50% in upcoming years, with strong fundamentals. \\n* VIAC - one of the most undervalued TV companies right now. Very strong portfolio and strong fundamentals, clean balance sheet. Frankly I spent hours trying to find a reason for such a low price and didn't manage to find any except for \\\"index fund problem\\\".  \\n* CI - insurance industry under the huge hit due to increasing expenses (people suffer from COVID) and reduced payments (people loosing job and might start cutting their spendings), but Cigna looks like one of the best to survive the storm and has a bright future for a long term. Faitly under-valued strong balance-sheet company.\\n* SU - European large cap producer of energy, data and sustainability facilities. \\n* BN - Another European large cap company: food producer. They position themselves as a healthy food producer, and COVID should not distract them as much as Americans food producers are. \\n* HD - One of rare bets on American consumer spending. Leader in the area of organizing houses in sub-urban zones. With growth of WFH setup, more people expected to migrate to the country-side, so in the long term HD might benefit. Their balance sheet is also very solid.\\n* VMC - Basic materials bet. Among all other basic materials companies, VMC looks the best. Also, despite I have high doubts about 1 tln infrastructure package to pass the Congress, VMC would benefit from this idea.\\n* BRK-B - no introduction is needed. Buffet underperformed S&P for a long time, but his portfolio is decent, he sits on a large pile of the cash and proper timing of deploying this cash would result in a great return later on. Still pretty safe to add BRK into my portfolio, their long term run looks pretty good.\\n\\nAlso I am considering adding 4 strong dividend companies with still promising futures.  \\n\\n\\n* IBM - it might look like a dying mamont, but IBM for years is a leader of patents. They year by year increase their presence in cloud infrastructure, AI, robotics and other topics. With new CEO targets growth, IBM has a pretty decent future for the moment with a diversified portfolio of technologies & patents. High hopes on IBM AI technologies. As well, IBM pays very huge dividends, so why not hold them for some time?\\n* T - the same story but in another segment. Might benefit from 5G, has a diversified portfolio, enters the \\\"stream wars\\\" area and pays a huge dividend. As a diversification for stocks who pays small dividends but grow in market cap, good choice. \\n* STX - Another high dividend representative from the hardware storage business. This area will stay around for a while, and STX is healthier than their competitors, look like a safe bet for a long term holding. \\n* ABBV - And the last high-dividend company from the healthcare segment. There is a lot of analysis of ABBV around, so no reason to repeat it all.\\n\\nAnd 1 ETF:  \\n\\n\\n* EXV6 - since I am EU resident, I need to invest into UCITS, and this is a basic materials ETF mainly RIO, BHP, GLEN, AAL. This segment supports all manufacturing around the world, why should they have gone?\\n\\nThat's basically it.

I would argue this approach only makes sense in a broad market index - like VOO you mentioned earlier. \\n\\nIndividual stocks are volatile and there is no evidence to support an average retail investor can project the future returns of any single company. You hear stories about people who double their money on AAPL or AMZN but you rarely hear about the people who lose all their money. An important property of a broad market index like the sp500 is that it represents approximately the average of all returns on the market. So when you invest in VOO you don't match the highest return available in the market but you avoid the worst possible return. If you go the other route and invest in a single stock, I argue there's no way for you to know which investor you'll end up as in terms of returns relative to the market. A interesting fact I a friend told me once was 2 out of evert 5 portfolio managers beat the market in one year. Only one of those two will beat the market two years in a row. If you invest in single stocks and try to beat the market, then you are no different than these professional portfolio managers (who frankly have more information than you).

I've learned that there is a better way to place this exact same trade though. \\n\\nA put credit spread sounds like the opposite, but it's actually get similar bias wise. So, imagine being the person who bought/sold you those calls. They have $5000 held for collateral and are hoping your contacts expire worthless so that not of it is used, but they get to keep your premium. So buy selling a call spread  you are being for the stock to go down below the lower strike. Now imagine it's puts instead, puts are opposite of calls and so you would be being that the stock price will be above the higher put strike. \\n\\nWhy would we want to do this? Because option prices decay over time. When buying options, you have to be right about the movement, but you also have to be right about WHEN it will move. If you sold the option though, and are eventually going to buy it back to close the spread, the time decay works in your favor. \\n\\nAdded perks: \\nPuts usually are more expensive, and you're selling them, so that's good. \\nYou have to lock up collateral but you take in credit to offset a good amount of that immediately. \\n\\nThe only con I can think of is that the collateral requirement in selling a spread tends to lock up more money than buying the spread. In my experience your increased chance of actually turning a profit, mostly due to time decay (theta), more than makes up for the extra up front capital.\\n\\nYou'd think you would lose more per trade this way, I did too. But when you set them up correctly, high probably debit spreads cost more per profit potential, if that makes sense. \\n\\nPro tip: selling a single credit spread is alright, but you can sell the opposite spread on the other side of the stock price using the same collateral because only one can possible lose at one time.

If you want to make a huge profit, that's going to come with more risks and if that's the case, wait til under 1000 and pray that it goes back up. If you want to invest in the company because you like what they do, just invest whenever because you believe in the company. You'll probably lose money short term but will gain money long term. If you just want to make money, I'd avoid a stock like TSLA until Price/Earnings comes more in line with car companies (obviously it'll be a little higher, but it's way out hand).

On top of that income disparity is growing, and housing is at all time highs on costs while wages remain stagnant. On top of that the us currency is being devalued by a lot of this stimulus (which is necessary and I think a very good thing, but is bad for investing). I think investing in the stock market with a healthy ratio of bonds to stocks, is a good idea, but you should be aware that the market looks extremely scary right now. It could keep going up 20% or it could plummet 40% in a week, it's hard to know. Last bit of advice, this sub doesn't like it usually, but diversify outside of the stock market.

If successful, it could move energy production/distribution from energy companies to consumers.\\n\\n> Has congress decided that completely autonomous vehicles are allowed to operate on all roads?\\n\\nNot as far as I know, but I think everyone will agree it's not a matter of if but when.\\n\\n> Has the liability issue of autonomous vehicles been settled?\\n\\nSame issue as the previous.

How many people are technically filing for unemployment but are still working or have agreements with their employer to go back to work? Or are being supported by the government?

I would absolutely buy a lot more if we saw the stock fall substantially (e.g. to somewhere near $200). Not probable, but not impossible either given how volatile the stock is. The stock is very expensive, so I would not get into a large position at the current levels. But if I had to buy one of them, I'd buy NVDA. Important to emphasize however that I invest for the long term (think 5 years from now and longer). If you look at NVidia as a company, they've had some good luck historically, but they are a terrific company with a great track record.\\n\\nINTC (although you probably didn't ask about INTC), I might still buy INTC if it falls substantially (say we see a price close to $30). Despite their difficulties, they can always turn around and e.g. Altera alone is worth a lot as a business.\\n\\nAMD, I have no idea. I don't trade, but if I did, then maybe the \\\"short INTC, long AMD\\\" trade has some runway left still. Like I said, long term, I am not bullish on x86 servers (and certainly not desktop) anymore.

It shouldn't be hard to convert a lettuce farm to cauliflower if demand for the latter booms enough to offset switching costs. \\n\\n2) the value of the underlying farmland increases indirectly from a cauliflower boom. Remember much of the value of a farm isn't necessarily from the crop it produces but the underlying dirt, the capability of production.

I'm not sure if all brokerages automatically exercise spreads, so I won't comment on this, but it they don't, it would be extremely reckless of them.\\n\\nI lost on a credit spread on SPY, so I had -$30,000 or so in my account for a few days, but I knew it wasn't accurate since I also saw that both legs of my spread exercised. There was another trader who committed suicide because they saw negative $730,000 in their account but didn't understand that their actual loss was much less. Please educate yourself on options before you start trading them.\\n\\nEdit: I just noticed that you were wondering about what happens if the put you bought is out of the money. In that case, I believe you just sell the 100 shares at market price, so you lose the difference between that and the put you sold. If the price were less than $1 under the put you sold (so $2,994), you'll still come out of this with a profit. The put you bought is only there to cap max loss.\", \"Yes, yes you are at risk!

Dump them before. Even if it's max loss. Better max loss than 300k from an assigned short and worthless long.\", \"If it's ITM it is exercised. If OTM it is not. If it's OTM the shares should be sold at a market price above the put price.\", \"and putting money into schemes about which you know very little is not?\", \"How does that even work though, doesn\\u2019t the broker force exercising the bought put to cover anyways? How can someone possibly be assigned several hundred thousand dollars in shares without the collateral?\", \"ok sold both my spreads, and actually between the two made $100 profit.\\nSo in case both Puts expired in the money how are the exercised? do I lose my collateral and get some shares in return? I'm confused how would this work any different than a cash covered put... this is simply a cash covered and hedged put? right? please? tell? me?\", \"Can you dump a put that you sold? How does that work? Just FYI I have never done a credit spread.\", \"Is it possible to close a put you sold before expiration? People are telling OP to close both positions but how do you close a put you sold?\", \"> How does that even work though, doesn\\u2019t the broker force exercising the bought put to cover anyways?\\n\\nBefore or after expiration?\\n\\nBefore:  Not if you don't have enough buying power to cover the exercise. A risk management team on the ball would close (buy to close) the whole spread before that could happen, though. They don't trust us to have the smarts to do that ourselves. Not all of them are on the ball though (I'm looking at you, Robinhood).\\n\\nAfter: If the long is ITM, yes. If it is OTM, I'm not sure what brokers would do. They are not obligated to do the exercise for you.\\n\\nBut it's not a good idea to trust a broker to do anything automatically. They could have all kinds of reasons why they don't do what you expect them to do. Don't leave it to chance, take your own action and control your own money.\", \"> So in case both Puts expired in the money how are the exercised? \\n\\nIn the perfect situation, you get assigned on the short put and your broker automatically exercises the long put. \\n\\nYou have to deliver shares to the long put and will receive the strike price x 100 in cash. You may be temporarily short shares until the assigned short put settles, but you'll have ~300k in cash.\\n\\nThen the short put assignment happens, and you have to deliver cash to the assignment and will receive long shares. The cash required will be less than the cash you collected from the long, by exactly the spread width, so you keep the difference. The long shares you receive cover the short shares.\\n\\nSo by Tuesday of the following week, you'd have the max profit of the spread in your account and no shares.\\n\\nBut that's the ideal situation, when everything works perfectly. It doesn't always work out that way. If both legs are deep enough ITM on expiration day to have low risk of getting split, call in an exercise order to your broker, at least 1 hour before the cutoff time (which ranges from 4 to 5:30pm EST, depending on your broker). Don't leave the automatic exercise of the long to chance. Keep in mind that there are long hold times on broker phones these days, so 1 hour ahead might not be enough.\", \"If both puts expired ITM they would both (*probably*) exercise and the long stock and short stock would cancel out. You would be left with no position at all.\", \"Yes, it's called legging out. You buy-to-close the short leg and can let the long leg ride.\", \"Yeah, but by close, they mean buy back the put they sold and sell the one they bought.

Canada\\u2019s big banks have already booked about $11-billion of provisions for credit losses in anticipation of projected losses from an array of debt, such as credit cards, credit lines, mortgages and other loans.  \\n>  \\n>Despite the economic plunge, consumers have so far remained largely current with their debt obligations. Personal insolvencies are below average and credit payments have remained stable.  \\n>  \\n>That stability has been made possible by extensive government programs, such as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit for people out of work and a wage subsidy provided to hard-hit businesses to keep staff working. The CERB, however, is set to expire in the fall and the wage subsidy is set to end in December.  \\n>  \\n>\\u201cOnce government support measures wind down, consumer loan charge-offs will rise as workers struggle to adapt to the postpandemic economy,\\u201d said a report published Thursday by Moody\\u2019s Investors Service.  \\n>  \\n>\\u201cThe main concern is that the economy is going to change in a post-COVID world, and many sectors and jobs may take a very long time to come back or not come back at all,\\u201d Jason Mercer, a Moody\\u2019s vice-president and senior analyst, said in an interview.  \\n>  \\n>The question is whether Canada\\u2019s banks have already booked enough provisions to cover loan losses down the road. Canada\\u2019s banks have allowed hundreds of thousands of customers facing financial stress to defer payment on a variety of loans, including more than $250-billion of mortgages. It\\u2019s not clear how many of those customers will be unable to fully catch up on their payments when the deferrals end.  \\n>  \\n>\\u201cI would suspect that we will see more provisions in the third quarter, but likely not as severe as the second because the economy has partially reopened since,\\u201d Mr. Mercer said. \\u201cLonger-term, future losses will depend on the duration of the crisis and whether we will be able to reopen more of the economy or be forced to reclose sectors if the pandemic worsens.\\u201d  \\n>  \\n>The banks\\u2019 full potential for credit losses is not \\u201cfully baked in\\u201d despite the $11-billion in provisions already set aside, Nigel D\\u2019Souza, an analyst at Veritas Investment Research, said in a report last month.  \\n>  \\n>\\u201cWe expect impaired loans to drive peak credit losses during this cycle. Impairments typically do not peak at the start of a recession and tend to lag as economic stresses mount,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe expect provisions to move higher over the coming quarters as deferrals and government support programs wind down.\\u201d  \\n>  \\n>Each bank has a different mixture of loans in its portfolios \\u2013 making provisions a tricky calculation. In addition, in late 2017, a new accounting standard called IFRS 9 has made forecasting losses even more complicated, requiring banks to divide provisions into two broad categories.  \\n>  \\n>One is for impaired loans, which are in arrears, but haven\\u2019t yet been written off as losses. The other is for performing loans, which are still being paid back, but are deemed at risk of becoming impaired based on economic forecasts and financial models.  \\n>  \\n>\\u201cWe continue to believe that the Canadian banks are well-capitalized to absorb elevated loan losses through the remainder of the current downturn, due in large part to the benefits of regulatory forbearance,\\u201d Mike Rizvanovic, an analyst with Credit Suisse, wrote in a research note.  \\n>  \\n>\\u201cHowever, we do see meaningful near-term risk of PCL (provisions for credit losses) and earnings volatility as some of the sizable portion of deferred loans as of Q2 migrate into \\\\[impaired loan\\\\] classification, the extent of which will be determined by the trajectory of the economic rebound.\\u201d  \\n>  \\n>Banks in Canada have worked in concert with the federal government to help blunt the economic effect of this crisis through targeted and tailored relief measures for individuals and businesses, Mathieu Labr\\u00e8che, a spokesman for the Canadian Bankers Association, said in a statement.  \\n>  \\n>\\u201cCanada\\u2019s banking sector is very well capitalized, has increased lending capacity and will continue to bring solutions to Canadians to help foster a strong recovery.\\u201d\", \"Pretty much.\", \"The last of the V8\\u2019s\", \"It would be like that movie bird box.

For me It was when I noticed most casual stoners I know switched to the stores recently. And it's only been what, a year and a half? This sector is in its infancy. And I don't even have a store near me in downtown Toronto.  There's so so so much more room to sell more weed. What other sector has that much untapped markets? I'd happily invest there then.

The other is the black market is pricing better quality weed (shipped) for what like half of what OCS is selling it for?  Why would you buy retail, unless you're in a rush and need a pre-rolled joint, when  you can just order online.  Canada clearly doesn't care about the missing revenue or this would stop tomorrow with strict enforcement and fines for black market goods.\\n\\nOh and a third thing just for laughs, you can grow more than you can smoke, legally, in your yard.  It's a weed at the end of the day, yes some are fussy but you can grow your own and save a ton.

I also am looking at smaller town Ontario, with older (boomers) folks. They're not going to have an ability to order and get weed delivered. They'll go into town for a booze run, and pick up some weed on the way. Look at the LCBO count in smaller towns. Huge amount for such a small population. If they slowly get into it, more than they already are, the retail shops space will grow. BM Dealers will slowly dissipate, allowing more demand for legal market. Plus all that BM stuff can get laced. People are currently lacing their stuff with fentanyl, etc. Those old boomers with retirement monry will want someone to talk to and have it regulated. They have lower risk tolerance than some teens trying to smoke out of a pop can behind their parent's garage\", \"I don't think it will be 2x priced for long.    I think the quality will increase and I think it takes more than a year or 2 to break people's black market habits.  As a grower I can near guarantee everyone won't be growing their own grade a weed to replace buying it. That shit takes time/effort that most people just aren't that interested in. Gardening isn't for everyone. Anecdotal but i used to buy from moms until I started growing at legalization. I've temporarily taken a break from growing and can't be arsed to order online when I can drop by the beer store/pot store next to each other on the way home from work.  Fair enough if you disagree but what other sector has a black market that big to potentially capture. I'd imagine there will be less new high school dealers or dealers in general deciding to start selling weed with legalization.
