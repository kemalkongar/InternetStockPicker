Bezos is fire because he’s a fucking ruthless tyrant who will watch the world burn if it means domination.

Gates is the foundation; without him, entire governments fail because they’re all still running Windows NT Server. And he has a literal foundation.

Elon is air because saving the planet and smoking dank buds etc.

And finally, Zucc is a giant like Bezos but made of more malleable, liquid-y material and because he can’t give a straight answer to anything.Is earth trying to dab?Captain Planet...None of these motherfuckers have a HeartThe water must flow.That's when the fire nation attacked.Everything changed when the Fire Bezos attacked...Fire Lord BezosThe last freedom bendersFire water earth fireNo heart cuz we dead inside.NiceWith your powers combuned!Brought to you by Google.Go Captain Planet!

Is that where the 🌈 🐻 live?But there is already a FranceI bet they could buy like 90% if they really wanted.Let's see. According to Google:

* Bezos = 183 billion
* Gates = 113 billion
* Zuckerberg = 88 billion
* Musk = 72 billion

Total = 456 billion

They could buy one year worth of every product and service made in Austria or Norway.

The actual value of the country is harder to estimate. I'm going to assume you need at least 20 years worth of GDP. This means the largest ~~EU~~ European country they could buy if they pooled all their money is Bosnia and Herzegovina.Damn, how do I apply for citizenship?Actually not even close to 1%[deleted]Naming rights are already in use in College StationFAGMANFirst rule of Faggyland...They shouldAckchyually their net worth together only represents .01% of the worlds net worth.He went surfing and forgot to program how to apply sunscreen.he's doing the rare 'whiteface' and I am offended.Bullish Zinc oxide.Davos Bukkake Breakout?I can’t believe his wife let him go out like that.your night terror demonHe went straight for the thermal compound on his face.https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/09/DataTNG.jpg

Being an IT expert is not a requisite to being a tech CEO.

I personally wouldn't trust a CEO to do anything except delegateYou mean a program installed.Tasha Yar already taught him everything he needs to knownah I saw that one episode, he's fully functional.He has kids tho?Lol theres a vid of young Elon after he sold PayPal making a quote along the lines of "look at all these Benjamins" or w/e. Stupidest line said in the fucking nerdiest way possible, dude looked like a total goober as well.

These guys are the prime examples of "be nice to those nerds because you're going to work for them some day".

But the world is better with them...except zuck. He creeps me the fk out.Elon has a lot of children tho from multiple baby mommas. He does give off Chad energy. He fuckin left big tiddy goth gf while she was pregoBill has always been a chad: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqfjiuqVrV4Elon's got like seven kids by a bunch of different women, he definitely fucks.Elon is alpha as fuck.Yeah 4 guys show up to restart your modem and end up fucking your wife.You can already see the facial on Zucky.She belongs to the streetsThat's where they're sent to dieDepends on how these SPY $280p faggies play outNo, that's San Francisco.Rainbow bear?It's not 70% of the Earth though.They could buy 99% of it, then send every other retard to the 1%, that way we wouldn't feel left out and would be a part of *some* 1%[deleted]Just a correction, Bosnia is not an EU country.I had no idea, until now, that it was Bosnia **and** Herzegovina. I thought they were two separate countries. TILThey can set their companies to do some of the buying and domination though. 

All you need is to buy off the world leaders and influence elections. (wait they already do that).

What if Miicrosoft made some viruses undetectable for their own benefit for example. Then stole a lot of stuff from people who couldn't complain 

Information monopoly = Facebook.
Market monopoly = Amazon.
Computer Infra monopoly = Microsoft and Amazon
Space race = Musk.So they buy it with a loan.  It's a fucking joke.I hate reddit dipshits who keep espousing this garbage. "BuT iTs nOt ThE AmOuNt oF LiQuID cAsH ThEY hAvE."

Hey idiot, they still have a fuckton of liquid cash. They can also take literally billions of dollars of loans from any bank they want at near 0% interest rates whenever they want for whatever they want, leveraged AGAINST THEIR FUCKING SHARES.  You pseudo-intellectual fucktard.

When you have that kind of wealth, you can buy anything you want.Still have a lot of liquid wealth.Still, if you calculate right and take everything into account... everything in the whole world is worth around $3.2billion

Edit: wow. Do I really need to add an /s you retards?I forgot no one is trying to acquire Amazon stock right now.Yeah, all of those illiquid assets provide no value or financial advantages they just sit there being worthless right. Honestly idk why they hold on to them they should just give them to me.That's aggy land though.You have got to be shitting me

People joking about him being an android and he literally becomes Data from Star TrekAh I see he got stuck in a sunscreen loop. Wonder if they fixed this in the latest releaseI think someone said it's a mineral sunscreen that doesn't hurt the reefs he's surfing near. He's being a good guy in this case.I thought you were joking.

It's really him, and it's sunscreen. He went surfing.He didn’t apply it incorrectly. It’s mineral-based sunscreen so that’s is safe and legal in Hawaii while also not coming off immediately in the water.

If you’ve ever been around open water swimmers they also go for the silver surfer look to protect their skin. Just google open water swimmer zinc and you’ll see tons of examples.Sir i dont appreciate u getting more upvotes than me, please delete it or my day is ruinedExecute: Open sunscreen bottle.

Execute: Apply sunscreen bottle.He was most likely wearing a zinc oxide sunscreen. They are really good for sun protection but often leave a terrible white cast on the face.It's zinc oxide, not regular sunscreen, dumbassracist aliens smhIt's ok when white people do it but when androids do it it's racist.

TNG's Data is the only only that gets a pass.no no no.. it's coo'.  He has a white friendDamn! That's a good one. Paging /r/4chan to create zucc `whiteface`rage.Hey I'm a white Martian and I'm offended. 
Green martians get all the love :(If a black guy is a mime is he racist for doing white faceslurpJesus fuckFuck humanity right now.Not-Mexican jokerZinc Oxide doesn't have to be expensive though. The stereotype of lifeguards with the white noses is zinc oxide.Oh so he is using a special type of sun screen that is better for the environment, typical mouth breather reactions trying to destroy the zuccAnd it’s required to be used versus traditional sunblock where the photo was taken.Nice referenceNo. Lafitte at least has style. Zucc will never have style.It is better for the environmentSorry zucc, I'll stick with my plebscreen!Long term I still think tech's going to outperform, but in the short term it'll probably trade sideways as money starts flowing into the more beaten down sectors.it's the eXPerience!Teletubbies background?XP wastePeople remember XP as being a horrible OS.  At the time though, it was a godsend of clarify after muddling their way through the clusterfucks that were windows 95/98 and dear god, that M.E. dumpsterfire.TIL that background actually belonged to a previous version of Windows.Ah, glad to see I'm not the only one who got crabs as a result of runescapeWhere can I buy Jagex shares?Selling coal certs is what got me into options cuz$11  🦀🦀🦀

The only one I got -.-Pestilence = Zuck because he makes us all sick of our parents posting shitty boomer humor on their FB walls

War = Elon Musk when he secedes from planet Earth and becomes King of Mars 

Famine = John Bezos because his employees must starve in order to meet the Amazon Prime^^^TM Fulfillment Quota

Death = Bill Gates because his shitty laptops are always dyingFacebook is war— flame wars

Amazon is famine (for its warehouse workers)

Microsoft is (blue screen) of death

So Tesla is... pestilence, sucked into your lungsPestilence - KILL Gates and his fake china virus manufactured in a wuhan lab

War - ZuCC because Facebook breeds hate

Death - The Bez for working his peons to death.

Famine - Musk Daddy because when you get that fucking high you're stomach is a bottomless pit.ThisYou must be fun at partiesIn like 1 religion.But when the world needed him most he vanishedBuffet the last cash benderHis first element to bend is liquidityI was waiting to read a reply like this LmfaoHe has a lot of printing to do before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe.. JPow can save the world.Cum contains waterThat’s his true form.Hes in Hawaii where they only allow reef safe sun screen.It’s sunblockLike wharf from Star Trek. With all that shit all over his faceIs it supposed to be Jeff the Killer from Internet Historian's video? (Zuck was used as the face)Reptiles burn very easily.Coolant leakZinc based sunscreen, it doesn't really soak into the skin and leaves a white filmPretty sure he was surfing. It's probably zinc, the stuff you see "lifeguards" put on each cheek. But instead, he covered his entire face which is fairly common practice.

EDIT: To the people saying it's not common practice, [here's a picture](https://www.singlequiver.com/enelpico/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/john-john-florence-biografia-750x321.jpg) of John John Florence, one of the best surfers in the world, with zinc on his face. Just compare his face color to the rest of his body.

Keep in mind, he is a pro and so I image more often than not the color is photoshopped down. I also believe he uses a [skin-tone zinc product](https://www.vertra.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/VERTRA-STICK-TINTS-WITH-FACES-1.png) now. 

But yes, covering your face in zinc is very common in the surfing community if you plan on being out in the water for a long time.Triumphant Roman generals would paint their faces red

Zuckerberg has a thing for Augustus

Maybe it's something to do with that

Maybe he's been initiated into an ancient Roman mystery cult

Maybe nothing can stop him nowHe was molting.He heard humans wear sunscreen on their facesEvery day he strives to become more and more like his god Data.He's finally become his final form, Jeff the killer.Two guys fucked up the fusion dance....men?Alert fake tendies at 1:40Happy cake dayBro wtf how? proof he’s not that great a programmer, can’t even get pull off a basic applicationhide it in the terms and conditionsTurns out it’s just softwareFapping to her facebook pics using sunscreen as lube is different to actually fucking someone..U asked for it"Shakira's daughter""No u" - Person who gave you goldAhh this guy is Zuck. Triggered.The world isn't better with Bezos.no the fucking world is not better because of them lmao

amazon is a massive monopoly, monopolies are not good for the world

even the founding fucking fathers of capitalism (who I'm pretty sure most of the people here masturebate to while reading their writings) said a true free market system could not exist with massive monopolies

zuckerberg is responsible for massive amounts of bullshit fake news being spewed for years and years

he created an entire industry that has quite literally created a generation of highly anxious, highly depressed people who constantly feel inferior and insecure, and are addicted to their dopamine drip phones

give me a fucking break

the negatives of those two heavily outweigh the positives

facebook was a net positive for the world probably the first 5 or so years of its existence, then it gave fake news the biggest platform on earth and also helped contribute to big data and spying.cyborg, cybernetic organism, terminatori mean yeah, he was a nerd, and then he started partying and experimenting with acid - and now he's not a nerd anymore. so he's basically like every person that's ever been to a music festival.Can you source that Elon vid? Can't find it. I need it. I need it bad. Real bad.Care to explain why the world is better with Bezos and Elon?They're all psychopaths, not one of them made the world better.

XP was an awesome OS. ME was the horrible one, as well as 8. With honorable mention to Vista, the 32-bit version.

I remember 95/98 being pretty serviceable, although needing some overhead if you were an enthusiast builder?Literally no one remembers XP as being a horrible OS, watchu talking about.XP was widely regarded as one of the most well designed and stable OS in modern times, in fact it was so popular that millions of machines were still running on XP up until a few years ago when Microsoft announced that they wouldn’t be updating it anymoreWtf? Nobody remembers XP as being a horrible OS. People remember XP as being a badass stable OS that ran the world for a decade straight. ME and Vista were awful, but XP was pretty much perfect.Windows 7 will and forever be the best OS Microsoft ever made.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bliss_(image)

Anyway, Amazon is optimizing inefficient distribution networks of the past out of existence.1. I said everyone except Zuck...not sure why you felt the need
2. Amazon isn't a monopoly. And even if it was, they don't dont employ a number of 'concerns' that these founding fathers had.

Zuckerberg is an awful person, IMO, but people making fun of him for surfing in Hawaii either 1) don't understand Hawaii's sunscreen laws to protect coral; 2) understand how zinc oxide based sunscreen works / look; or 3) both.

Zinc sunscreen is going to give anyone a white cast and if you're participating for a long time in a water sport you have to pile it on and basically look like silver surfer when you start so it stays on. Your other option is "clear" sunscreen that destroys marine life. This meme is stupid and we shouldn't be deterring people from protecting their skin in the sun because they don't want to look "silly." This needs to be normalized.He applied it correctly. What's the joke?:)Dude Franky has the most super style out of everybody.> XP was an awesome OS. ME was the horrible one

Hey man, I'm agreeing with you.  Over the years since I've just come across IRL and online discussion where people seemed to just have shit to talk about it and left wondering what timeline they were living in.

> I remember 95/98 being pretty serviceable

There I'm going to disagree.  The man feature 95 introduced us to was the BSOD.  They were still trying to make this "Plug and pray" snake oil work out as advertised.  You were still dealing with the driver hunt and IRQ jumpers on some boards to work properly.

Of the pre year-2000 OSes Win 98 SE with all the windows updates was the most stable from my recollection.

I don't count win 3.x and prior as an OS b/c they weren't, it was just the program manager GUI dos program.[imagine](https://i.imgur.com/5uTICdw.jpg)> Runescape is like their only profitable thing they own

OSRS has a way bigger userbase nad paying subscribers than Runescape 3Yeah, realistically, I'm just memeing. Love the game but in terms of its success as a product, it's primarily due to its incredibly loyal customer base and not the product / game itself being great. The game would be considered a pretty terrible product actually, by relative standards.Yo wth, Baller is worth 71B? Dude is super under the radar all things considered.Just chapotraphouse as far as I know, and when it happened the users just shrugged it off as “yeah makes sense lol”. Why?So I picked the bad researchers? -.- And how do you know my wife???Most religions don't have those characters, I'd be willing to wager that more have the system of elements than Pestilence, War, Death and FamineYou are true, we cannot fathom the final form. This must be one of his chrysalis phase.You ok?It’s pretty much the only sunscreen that’s completely reef and marine life safe so it’s a stupid thing to make fun of him for imoJust has the adverse affect of looking like a shitty mime.Yup, I know. This is all coming from a fairly pale-skinned person who was born and raised in Hawaii.A robot bro come on..

We got Alien Musk trying to get back to home planet .

Zucc is AI from Foundation trying miserably to hide with the humans.

Gates is the Rugrats dad trying to make wacky inventions. Revolutionary condoms to turning poop into drinkable water. 

Bezos is Lex Luther.Uh, I count at least one alien.Something firm is included in the updateUnderated CommentBecause of the implication.Is it possible to learn this power?

r/kowalski_memesThere's always an argument for all sides to everything. 

That said, the Amazon commercial that uses a deaf employee to talk about his job and how great it is in sign language while putting up captions so the non--hearing impaired folks who aren't illiterate but can't understand ASL can know what the commercial is talking about gives me some hella creeps. 


I don't know why, I can't put my finger on it. 

I mean, younger me would've thought it kind of nice that they're playing nice with the deaf community, I suppose. My brother was deaf, he had a lot of obstacles, all that jazz, ya know? 

But then, it's just with every single thing going on in the world, it seems a little weird that now all of sudden they're seeming to pander to that community and it feels slightly gross, I guess. It's like the chose the one group you never hear anything about and said yes, let's use these people as a stepping stone to get the masses to believe we are benevolent and to pave the way to world domination or whatever.Slavery made life convenient for some people. Having clothes made in sweatshops makes life convenient for some people. The world isn't made better by the existence of either. If what you care most about is convenience you need to reassess your priorities in life.Go shill for a shitstain billionaire elsewhere, brother.Amazon isn't a monopoly?

Uhhhhhhh, counterpoint: Yes they fucking are.how do 1%er cummies taste?Hes your typical nerd, oh wellI fucking love it, but has it improved my life? I save a little money and in the long run it's going to fuck our economys and the only one profiting is Bezos.That is not the metric by which innate goodness is measuredSo it all comes down to increased productivity of wage slaves? How do these guys make computational power and the internet available to me? That's taking it too far.And, then a cop shows upBüblyWell obviously. But that’s not the point.I was being pedantic / playful, but you thanked me.

Last time, I was being genuine and I got insulted.

Well, thank you for not insulting me.So the trick is to not have americans build it. Okay got itNot many aircraft carriers really exist. Specially civilian onesDoubt he could get a 10bil line with no covenants actuallyNo banker would be dumb enough to give money like that. Depending on the reasons for the loan, it could even make TSLA stock tumble. A bank would wonder why he would be first of all getting a loan instead of just liquidating a few billion and conclude he fears TSLA stock will plummet in the future. Business/home loans are a totally different deal that make more sense.A higher concentration of it. Many surfers who spend the entire day in the oceans have faces like zuc. But, of course, Zuc just got the most potent sunscreen for two hours doing whatever the fuck that was in the ocean.Zink oxide is in all sunscreen. It’s just nano particles. Older cream uses macro particels which makes the sunscreen thicker and difficult to applyI think it will be hard to normalize something that is rarely used and makes you look like silver surfer or a mime but I see good reason for it. Would be cool if someone made clear sunscreen with the same advantages of mineral basedFine...Kuma> There I'm going to disagree. The man feature 95 introduced us to was the BSOD. They were still trying to make this "Plug and pray" snake oil work out as advertised. You were still dealing with the driver hunt and IRQ jumpers on some boards to work properly.

Yeah I phrased this badly, there was a ton of driver hunts and IRQ BS to get through - I think I enjoyed it a little because it paved the way for my troubleshooting skills and IT career?Fuck you got meYeah I'm counting both of those as runescape - the company owns other stuff. But also FYI I think RS3 still brings in more money through loot boxes and keys and stuffDude is absolute GHis net worth sky rocketed in the past 5-7 years, along with MSFT stock.  
It’s kinda like Bezos who went from a “top 100” billionaire to the worlds richest person -by a huge margin- in less than 10 years.Where did religion come in ?? The title says the four horsemen of the apocalypse. The facts are these horsemen are: pestilence, war, death and famine . It's not about religion , these are the literal factsHe said he's dying, so maybe noAgreed. I hate zucc as much as the next guy. But I feel like the people that make fun of him in this photo have never been surfing / snorkelingFirmware or software ?yeah but you have to give somethingTrue but I mean what company doesn't pander.

Some people call it pandering. Some people call it marketing...Could you go back to my comments and point out exactly where I said what I cared about **"most"** was convenience?Shit, good thing you made your own cellphone.In what?So what’s your grand plan? nationalize all the companies? Then one government “monopoly” will control every aspect of our lives

You’ll change your mind when you get your first big boy paycheckNot sure if one day shipping and refunds without questions asked would be a thing today without amazon.Who said we measure goodness? They make certain aspects of life on the cost of other people. As a customer they make your life better (you can argue not for americans, because they evade a lot of taxes) , as a worker or rival they make your life worse. Its not just Black and whiteMicrosoft is a big reason why computers are the way they are today... If you seriously cannot comprehend how Bill Gates has positively contributed to your life then you’re pretty ignorantWage slaves? Wtf?

Billy organized a company that made computers cheap so a few decades later you can use it to bitch and whine about him. Seems like hes helped you too much.What is the point? 

Americans are overworked, depressed, obese, and killing themselves. 

Clearly there's something more than being wealthier than an Old Navy employed five year old Bangledeshi seamstressthey can just make one. buy samsung or somethingtheir yachts have helipads and hangars.  Maybe go with the Japanese designation of "helicopter destroyer"Most sunscreens sold are still chemical sunscreens and don’t contain any zinc or titanium.They make “sheer” versions too but they can still cast. There are different products out there that are made for beach goers vs people spending hours and hours continuously in the water.

There’s a zinc based product called eme and they basically advertise the white cast as a benefit—once you cant see the sunscreen it is time to reapply.The Four Horsemen are religious symbols, sorry, I hadn't noticed the small print, my bad.Which is like most people.HardwareI’ll give 3 inchesNot an unexpected comment from someone with a username like that.I could also explain to you how gravity works or why the sky is blue but I really don't have the time dudeThe comment I was replying to was saying that people “could be a part of some 1%”

I was pointing out that most Americans already are part of the 1%

That’s all.Yupwrong, sunscreen with a UV value above 20 is not possible without Zinc oxideThat's more than you've ever given before3 inches is 7.62 cmSo you dont have an answer. This would literally be a 1 word answer for you, instead of the excuse you wrote.The global 1%, not their own.Stfu casualI wouldn't answer somebody who asked me why water is wet, eitherDont be stupid. They dont have a monopoly. But keep the excuses going.Don't be stupid says man claiming Amazon is not a monopoly

😔 thanks, robinhood$0.01 or $0.05 is a value

Now I’m all in on MSFT.Have 205c for 8/14.  IT WILL PRINT.JPow is coming for you.If my call doesn't print I'm coming for ya. Don't put that juju out thereAfter the wasp nest falling on youWas trading RTX, DAL, MSFT, XOM, BP, SPPI, PRU, SPDR, QQQ. Sold all of it picked up 1400 shares of ZNGA at 10.37 (-9.16%

Still holding GUSH picked up at 49.80. (-35.98%)Blue chips will absorb the struggling companies. You will brag to your friends that you bought amazon at 3300 while being laid up in an Amazon retirement home one day.[deleted]At least your dad doesn’t mind you being there#**SHUT THE FUCK UP OR I WONT LET YOU WATCH ME FUCK HER AGAIN**this is the most hackneyed shitguys what's up with this joke about your wife's bf?The window or the bat?So you are hoping SPY his ATH's ? 

I doubt it will hit 400 this year, even if we cure covid there is a ton of other issues we have to address because of covid. Like the rising unemployment, impending homelessness crisis due to evictions, etc.its nice due, i know a guy he has - 530.000, he lost his depo and has debts for the rest of his lifeThe world is fucked who wouldn't want a trip to space right now?Don't you jinx spce thats where all my money is right now and I'm quite happy with itWhat's Ford got to do with this?Migrate over to biotech.I had iron condors on TSLA at 1300 and 1400 for Jul 10. Both got blown So I finally decide to go long volatility with 7/17 TSLA 1570 Calls and TSLA ends up at 1500 (my next Iron Condor target). TSLA has lost me 15K this year. I have bought puts, sold calls, sold condors. All have been a loss. Its wiped out the 10K I made on TSLA stock last year.

Elon giveth and Elon taketh awayit can. Literally nobody knows. obvious levels are 175 (will probably break it), 172.5, around 170, from just looking at 15 min chart.

It can start going up as well, we don't know.Damn!AZN is gonna be lit on MondayThis is the way.

Edit: Thanks for the award!That's only for calls, with puts you roll up and out"And I trade on Robinhood, so..."G double O....SameBuying puts but can't afford eye care?[deleted]I don’t wish that upon my greatest enemies.Wasp Street BetsYou have WSBSTNG tanker gang shall rise againInverse ETFYo lemme hold thatThat must be after hours when you have gains all day.Nah the pole falling is when your calls go -80% so you sell.  The window falling is when the stock rebounds and your calls are worth 10x.Cover those kneesBOTCHED. BOTCH JOB. GET ME SOME TRASHaaand the giant stick, lengthwiseCan this guy get a gold?Why znga?Why the fuck would you buy gush?You bought zynga near the top . GjHave you ever spent money on a ZNGA game?  ATVI?  EA? TTWO? NTDOY? Now think of what gaming stock to buy.Until the big bear market comes and blue chips fall 50-60%NoI am holding but felt a pinch after whole week it kept dropping. I have confidence in Amazon because I understand how much AWS alone is raking.
I am planning to buy a bit more this week to average overall cost lowerWhat about Costco? Still seems like they're poppin offYea I concur, it’s boring regurgitation every time it gets repeated.It's a joke on being a cuckold because they are losers for losing money.

It's not an unusual joke in any of the more niche subs that also double as meme subs on reddit tbhIt's called "gambling", sir! 

I don't really think it will either, but seeing as I've sold five times more calls at +80% to +130%, I'm willing to risk -99% for that slim chance it moons!! XD 

I honestly expect there will be another dip soonish, which is when I will buy 10x more calls at discount :3

Edit: why are you being downvoted?? This is called a DISCUSSION; if others don't agree that's fine wtf XD[deleted]Are you holding any Tesla calls today? Elon saw your comment and wants to pay you back today.Maybe. We will see. They are the most promising, but remember these are phase 3 trials. The FDA can approve after the completion of these trials. But that doesn't mean it is safe. Phase 3 trials simply means that it is a large testing sample, and it is supposed to be for a long period of time. 

These vaccines are being rushed to market, which is concerning. 

Vaccines are super easy to create, it's the safety of them that usually takes a long time to nail down.

AZN has over 30k participants in their trial, so it is the best to date. But that doesn't mean they will yield satisfactory results. 

The point of the vaccines is to increase our immunity without being exposed. If the vaccine causes adverse effects, or provides a middling immune response, it's dead in the water. 

If you are going to play AZN on monday, scalp it for quick profit on the way up, but I wouldn't hold through the annoucement. You can always get back in by selling puts and stuff if their stock soars.YES SIR!!!I just watched that the other day so now I finally get the jokeD E Y E good eyeee good eyeeBeing able to clearly see the charts seems needlessly stressful.So far buying puts has proven pretty difficult for me to figure out how to make money on. Even when The stock did go down. Am I an idiot??-3 downvotes? So 3 upvotes?20 downvotes**Stare two red buttons and wipe sweat out*.jpeg

Red button 1: Wasps

Red button 2: AutistsNo enema is that great."Sorry to hear about your cancer diagnosis.  But don't worry, you still have AIDS!"NAT any time soon.*Holds breath in MRNA*.  I hope AZN’s vaccine results are not as good or validates Moderna’s.Lmfao.... criesThey've consistently missed their EPS and their P/E is 7 times higher than it should be.... There's no logical reason why anyone should buy ZNGA. YOLO!The real question is which is actually worse GUSH or Zynga.[deleted]They will still hold out just cause of the massive inventory, way the goods are sold in bulk and good pricing. The only way for them to really grow is to do what Amazon is doing while keeping shipping free, returns easy, same day shipping and all that with a good online interface (outside of filters which suck on amazon it is a pretty appealing looking site).

They need to compete in that quick free easy shipping to your house and I've already gotten Amazon next days a couple times. It feels good and people will be chasing thatClinical results supposed to be announced monday. May boost them more.I am but they are not going to print as stock will dump after earnings like always.

[Here’s my high score from Friday.](https://i.imgur.com/uiXn4gg.jpg). When this hits $10 I’m already a millionaire. I got 100K shares by trading with VISL - bought 100K at .43 and it gapped up to 1.1 turning $43K into over $100K. Then I traded up the NKLA IPO. Then moved over to MVIS with 100K shares. I’ve since purchased more. Putting me over 104K shares. I suggest you do some research and by MVIS before it’s too late. This isn’t a pump and dump. Go look at the charts and read what I posted. I can’t force you to believe me.It was. Reached $3.45 on Friday. Discount at $2.75 now.

[https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640)> Tesla CEO Elon Musk added a whopping $5 billion to his net worth on Monday thanks to Tesla’s never-ending stock rally, allowing him to finish the day as the fifth-richest person in the world with a net worth of $74.2 billion.

> Musk, who as recently as a few weeks ago was No. 20 on the global rankings, according to Forbes, is now behind only Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Microsoft’s Bill Gates, luxury goods titan Bernard Arnault and Amazon chief Jeff Bezos.At least use freedom units, not this queen currency...Okay buffetA penny saved is a penny earned.

I can no longer tell the difference between fantasy and reality on this subIt's 2 pennies actually, WAY more gains than 2 cents.[deleted]Depends if he paid commissionIt just wouldn’t make senseIn the UK, we have a Capital Gains Tax Allowance of £12,300.The whole thing?!GoddamnIronically, in this case the gain in karma is equal to the total loss in dollars.6.6M Karma in a year with icelake.Funny L = Lira.

I can better inform the masses once I'm done with season 3I do the same. It doesn't have to be Dec 31st though. I just delete after I send my taxes in and reinstall when I get my return (normally send it second week of January and get it electronic return by early Feb). Zero paper trail, suckers.

 Last year I lost 17k trading YOLO options, it sucked, but at least they can't tax me even more on it since I deleted everything while they were looking over my taxes. Got my refund and everything no issueIt’s 2 euro cent coinsWhat are taxes on 1 dollar? 30 cents? Wait...is this negative gains? Lmao.I know nothing about UK taxes. Is that for real?FThat's £ not $So he lost moneyThey only round up to a dollar if it’s .50 or more. Otherwise they round down. So in this case he wouldn’t pay any at allYeah, it takes all day - poor guy doesn't even get a lunch break.

Non US residents do not pay US capital gains tax.[deleted][deleted]Shutup and take my USD!If you get that money from OP, then DM me cuz Joe Biden is doubling any money we send to him. So I was thinking we could double that money, and then send it to Barack Obama for another doubling because he is also doubling moneysmooth 🧠    
  
makes his thoughts aerodynamicWait, are we allowed to use anything other than Robin Hood here?Thanks. I will start trading options, so I'm looking for a broker. My broker doesn't have options. Btw, the YouTube chanel of trading212 is awesomeI guess I need to be a UK citizen to use it right?Would totally do this, but trading212 has no option trading..BeCum*Cum filled gay retardsThey don't realize it's stupid, AKA they don't see it as something you need balls to do...I still can't fix my fucking account from starting out options with about $3k in spy puts bought 3/21. I could not have been more certain, but still didn't play with more than I could lose.Look what sub you're in. We're all retardedBothLosses can be written off, no?Well that’s only if this was your *only* trade though. Only the final value of your costs vs proceeds is rounded, not every single trade.[deleted]Why would you pay the US anything if you didn't live there and weren't a citizen...?Huh? This post is in pounds...You type in the cost basis and the proceeds, each one gets rounded to the nearest dollar. In this case it would be the sameI thought it was Soulja Boy who was doubling money?Only if you are a UK/European tard.To be clear Trading 212 does not offer options. For options trading the main options (lol) are Interactive Brokers (IB) and TastyWorks. Both of which can have pretty pricey fees 

What trading212 offers is commission free share dealing and leveraged CFD trading.

I agree the youtube channel is great I would recommend it to all beginners looking to trade CFDsFilthy franks YouTube this doesn’t? /sNot just the UK, basically anywhere except the US and Canada.#best use of cumWhy is he getting downvoted? He’s not wrong tbh.I'm not cum filled!Borrowing money to trade with isn't stupid, just risky. What's stupid is paying 15 percent interest on money you're borrowing to trade with.There wasn't any capital loss here, so you can't write it off. He would only lose money from taxes, and of course you can't write off taxes to reduce your tax burden.First £12,000 tax free.

£11,999.98 gains to go before tax lolto use their stock market and all that.Global police protection. Sorry, did you not want a real answer?[deleted][deleted]No you're remembering wrong. Soulja Boy is doing a special deal- $10 per crank.I am Argentinian, so of course I am European.Also for broke-ass lurkers they also have a “practice” option which gives you 50,000 to fake spend on fake stocksOk thats a difference. So this post is a stock cfd?> pretty pricey fees 

Last I knew, Tastyworks is $1/contract to open and no fee to close. Is that considered pricey?Eh, kind of a lame joke in hindsight I even laughed way too hard at....YetAt 2% it's risky, at 5% stupid and at 15% you have abandoned conscious thoughtExactly! That's exactly what I was talking about...IRS is a 501c confirmed[deleted]Out of curiosity, why are you not using the 212 ISA account? You pay 0 tax. You could make 1 million and pay no tax on itI guess I just assumed TSLA had a ticker outside the US. That does not appear to be the case.Uhhh nothing there says it rounds up to the nearest dollar...? Am I missing something?.... ya fuck me for asking the person who stated something as if it were a fact.You wish, gato.Found Hitler> broke ass-lurkers

^(Bleep-bloop, I'm a bot. This comment was inspired by )^[xkcd#37](https://xkcd.com/37)No this post is just a standard share on Trading 212 invest by the looks of it.> Is that considered pricey?

Sir this is /r/wallstreetbets 

Seriously though, $45 for cash withdrawals is pretty steep but yeah Tastyworks is definitely more affordable than IBYou’re just getting downvoted by the gay retards, not the cum filled ones. Don’t worry about it shorty.Cum here then;)YepI did look at that but I do not expect an annual return of over £12,000, which is the tax free capital gains allowance in the UK, so I won't be paying capital gains tax anyway.For what it is worth, in the UK, income of each type is rounded down to the nearest £ before taxes are calculated.r/merval is leakingI AM CANADIAN! Wealthsimple trade is where its atYepYoung, dumb and full of condiments, as they say[deleted]Fair enough - you should just use that anyway. It’s the exact same as the invest account except you just pay 0 taxI think you mean dripping into the carpet, sinking beneath it and leaving a funny smell for months.it's not a livable wage though, it's in an alright place imoCannot argue with that.Is it just realized capital gain though? If you can have a normal salary from a job on top that is pretty solid.That's rightYeah you get a taxable allowance of around 12k as well, can’t remember exactly.yeah, that's why I say it's in a good placeDang that is a good deal.i might actually do better without a strategy**M**ake

I loved Trump so much, I had all the MAGA hats and Apprentice shows. I pray to Trump every night, thanking him for the life I’ve been given. “Trump is love” I say, “Trump is life." My wife’s boyfriend hears me and calls me a gay bear. I knew he was just jealous of my devotion to Trump. I called him a cunt. He hits me and sends me to sleep. I'm crying now and my Positions hurt. I lay in bed, really cold. I feel something warm... It's Trump I was so happy.

He whispers in my ear "This is my market." He grabs me with his orange hands, and puts me on my hands and knees. I'm ready. I spread my ass cheeks for Trump. He penetrates my butthole. It hurts so much, but I do it for Trump. I can feel my butt tearing and eyes watering. I want to please Trump. He roars a MAGA roar as he fills my butt with his love. My wife’s boyfriend walks in. Trump looks him straight in the eye and says, "It's all puts now”. Trump leaves through my window. Trump is love. Trump is life.Microsoft

I spent a lot of time learning the terminology and such, but the tutorials I've watched don't have the same interface as the program I use (Ally), so it still confuses the shit out of me a bitM

**A**gainThey've all been made great again under TrumpI don't have much advice other then make sure if you're using a tracker to be using minute to minute since ive had prices drop 10% and more on me about the same time.    Uhh something something balls of steel,  dont pull out to early and dont pull out too late.     Also look up theta gang strats on youtube once you get more into it etc,   I used to not really have a strat and went with gut feelings but theta strats have made me a steady flow of cash lately.Have you tried paper trading? If not, I highly recommend it before wasting a bunch of real money. Just treat your paper account like real money (like actually convince yourself you're investing your own money) and you'll learn a lot.if your option experiation date is about a week out, if the stock doesnt move up you will lose 20-30%. get ready to sell if this happens. i lost 2.5k on first call option just last friday. learn from my mistakes.Which tutorials did you watch please?I’ M  O L D  G R E G🎵BRENNAN HAS A MANGINA!🎵

I've actually been buying and selling stocks for over a decade, just new to options!That's wild! I set the exp for next month and only bout a single contract across a few companies. Spent less than two hundred bucks all together to learn how it worksThis is it right here.  Just the one.  

Can. Not. Go.  Tits up.Here’s a painting of baileysWhatever the point is I liked the copy pasta and I would give it a perfect scoreNp happy cash flow!  also remember despite what these awesome morons do daily,   dont fucking yolo all your money on a "sure thing"Afaik 6/9 is a perfect score no?Oh definitely not. I've allotted myself a small portion to learn on using profit I made off of NVAX at 40$ a share.

Would you be cool if I PMd you what I bought and you can tell me why it was a shitty move?But... but what if it’s a sure thing?Search the origin of the 5/7 meme ;)feel free my friendo,    I'm hitting they hay for tonight,  but i can look it over in the morning if you don't mind.  Provided these arent positions that close tomorrow but I doubt thats the case.Only if you think it's a sure thing ;) but I dont listen to wsb too much on sure things lolOh yes it is quite excellent.Yeah I need to rack out too! No rush at all. Thanks again!born 69 days after 4/20 it’s a sign i swear we gotta go all in.. my crystal ball says 4,269.69 by thursdayTrue autist move : checking the stock every ten seconds to do the right 69 420 screenshoot to make us retards happy. Thanks for your service, it's honest work.I bought in at $192 not as a smart investment but because I own a Tesla and like the company. I’m up over 50k since June of 19’. Sometimes it’s better to be lucky than good.Show this to Elon on Twitter, he will probably let you design his next car, Simpson’s style.Nice.N“Sees the picture” and replies Ughh I’m that guy😭...I can show you 100 other intraday charts that read -$69.00 (-4.20%), because I stare at the charts all day like a 🤖 because I don’t trust algos yet...timeing is everything I never use condoms . 
I have a NICE pullout gameAt this point you should go all in

These are the gods telling you the earnings are goodWell, I got my beginners luck with Tesla shares. They weren't the first share I bought, but like second or third. Lucky break, lol, didn't buy many though. 

Obviously I have no idea what the fuck is going on. I literally have no clue when to sell, or what profits I should take. They may fall to $200 tomorrow for all I know. I could make 20K and I'm literally - literally - a retard. God Bless America (and Australia).Stock symbol TMT (Time machine travel ) had a huge day - lots of investor interest in traveling to the past  to repurchase Tesla as well as eliminating Covid before it begins . Definitely a stock worth looking into . 
Big announcement tomorrow morning form CEO Michael J FoxThis is the way.How to investElon can sell everything he has. Then tweet something to tank the stock and then take it all private himselfWow. U waited way too long to get those numbers lmao. If u would spend that time making money instead maybe u would actually be able to afford some Now go buy Elon’s short shorts and the circle will be complete!Old timers said, "never try to time the market"

This autist did not listen and he got rewarded!The possibility of having your account liquidated in the AH is such bull shit.NiceNiceJust remember everything that has happened since the begining of the universe , every single particle movemenet has led up to this moment.You son of a bitch, I’m in.

edit: It was like 2 shares. 5 total, but some at like $890.How long did you have to wait to capture this slice of perfection...Bought a lot at avg ~315 so this makes me not give any fucks.

Nice screenshot grabNicecockbite buddy of mine picked up 20 shares near it's low while i was sleeping on it to see if it would go down another $30...I bought Tesla at $225 and sold at $330. 

Fuck me.In and out on that first dip 1600c was niceOh my goshIt's so they can pretend everything is normal.I sold at $560 last year for a loss. That’s why I quit stoxks and started options.Would that be a good time to buy hypothetically? Jokes aside.

Just you wait for the earnings report....Anyone know if usps stopped delivering mail?Someone had a big 'ol DD post about Tesla that I read and it inspired me to buy a put. So, I owe my tendies to that big post...

Although I think the post was telling me to buy calls, but I didn't read it anyway.I'll never know this pain(?) cuz I have absolutely no idea how to play the stock market!!I bought at 230 and sold at 560.  thought i was a genious but nobody told me it could go higher :(NiceNiceNah just OP.

OMG NO WAIT ITS THE SEXNUMBER AND WEEDNUMBER OMFG DUDE THATS SO FUCKING HILARIOUS420, I bet the Saudi wishes they both tsla at $420.For those that don't get it.

The percentage decline is related to a famous Musk tweet.

Inside joke I guessIt's the holy sign, calls for days to retire soon!Oh look it's the daily post with the two numbers. Indeed what are the odds that a community of people who stare at numbers all day would come across these two very hilarious numbers? Can't wait for tomorrow's postIt's going to be even funnier when it's down $420 (69%).NiceNicemy grade 11 economics teacher told me i shouldn’t buy tesla. school is for fools.I literally screen shotted the same thing, but was at work and couldn't post.

I’ve been got about 25k in right now and have slowly pulled out around another 25k which is now in total market and all-world. I’ll probably just keep doing this method. I’m cautiously optimistic.With positive news about a vaccine, Trump acknowledging the disease again, and the irrationality of the market, I honestly wouldn't be surprised if it jumped to 2000.I will trade all my fiat for gold, silver, Marijuana, and Tesla.

Bust in her to mark your territory and make her eat a Plan B.Thanks Tom Segura3. ???
4. ProfitShort my credit scoreOkay dude, see on battery day!I had two shares at $265 at one point smh.Hindsight is 420/69

In 2009 I played around with the idea of using one of my schools computer labs to mine Betco1n during the night or on the weekends, it wasn't that uncommon for me or other students to use the lab to render 3D animations overnight and I had full admin rights for the lab. 

Oh no I just did the math. I would have been able to mine around 300,000 co1ns in a single weekend. Fuck.Bought 10 shares at 420.69 just for the luls no regrets today still holding thoughMy cousin has never mentioned this place but bought 20 shares at like 480$ and has held onto them, something tells me he might be here.Very doubtfulHow are you even allowed on this sub with logic like thatI'm excited for you!  I like the slow pull/diversify idea. Maybe one day I'll have a few k to play with. I'm just getting my nest egg together and in a few years I'll be eating from the traders trough (hopefully).NiceThey went out of order. Therefore, they must suffer the inevitable fate of the retard downvote.They must pay for replying to the wrong commentNiceEEEGClearly you’re a new fag just like all the people downvoting me
>Bust in her to mark your territory and make her ~~eat a Plan B.~~ husband raise your child.Chew*I was trying to remember who I heard it from and just couldn't. Definitely Segura.I meant like to begin with before you profit you stupidWhat’s this meanAnd you didn't believe in papa Elon?!I bought 9 at about that price and sold one at 270 still got 8 though.I sold 200 shares at 670 a couple of month ago with a 400%+ return. This makes me a retarded 🌈🐻 all the way. Meanwhile, all this time I thought I was an extremely effective autistic bull.

I only blame myself for ignoring the signs. Papa Powell's printer going brrr, wall street not giving a flying fuck about main street, stonks always go up, elon musk had a baby named whateverthefuckhisnameis, nkla is worth 15B+, Covid-19 infections rising, but mainly, printer always go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrI had 5000 shares at 189 last year. FMLI had 10 shares at $20, sold at $30...

Then bought 10 shares at $200, sold at $300...I bought 48 shares at 400 and still holding. Basically this was all my savings. Hoping for 4000 in a year and 8000 in 2 years.I had 600 at $36 back in 2011 or 12😭

buy and hold, kids, when you have something this good.Bruh. I had my finger on the button to buy at $26 (not a typo) and I talked myself out of it.Lol yeah I had 5 at 330...........I bought 220 shares shortly before it had a peak around the $260’s. I didn’t know shit about stocks (still don’t) and panic sold when I lost $1000. 

Now I just buy a stock or two of whatever seems cool and figure I’ll let them sit for 20 years.I had 10 shares at 176 @ one point. 😬What's with the 1Jeez what's with buying the stock. This is a casino bro. If you'd gotten yourself some calls you might have been someone's wife's boyfriend rn.Imagine rubberbanding so hard you get from full on gambling to reinvesting your winnings. Thats monk grade discipline.It’s a fun grind. Good luck to you!NiceNice.Nice.Goodbye.SaveCLI love hearing, “Make me a single mom”. 

They already know the drill.Good ol Tommy Buns1. Buy stonks 
2. Stonks go brrr
3. ????
4. Profit
I literally can’t be more clear.It means credit score is falling

And short means profiting when prices are fallingYears ago a professor of mine said he liked TSLA and we should all check it out. I didn’t buy and it was at $25 fmlI had 500 shares and sold them for $250 for 10% profit. Imagine the FOMOdon't beat yourself up too bad, 400% is still great.That woulda been $8 million dollars nowLmk when you buy 10 shares at $2000.When Tesla hits $3,000, you're gonna be loaded!Go on...You should be proud bro. If you make 10% ten times you double your money, and y'all jabronis beat that.attention:

someone hopes to sell in 2 years for more than 400

this is the confirmation that the course will fall under 400 until then!TSLA worth $1.5T in two years?  It’s nice to hope I guess...That is a FAT L750 at ipo. I feel your pain.ouchThe Illuminati broB word is a ban wordCause - Invest 1st, then trade. If you don't have any long calls, you're doing it wrong.NiceNiceButler or butt-ler?Not too late to buy though. Tesla will be $300,000 in 10 years while Berkshire will stay at $300 k. You’ll regret it more looking back when you could’ve bought Tesla at $1,500tbf why would you listen to your professor unless it was an elite school. if they were any good at picking growth companies they wouldnt be a professor.

well I guess they dont have to be any more lmaoAh well, happens. MIT students could get $100 in Tulips for free back in 2014. A big percentage of them didn't even bother. Another big percentage took it and immediately cashed it out for Dollars. They could have been your wife's boyfriend rn. I see TSLA more or less the same way. And I'd still buy puts all day if the IV hadn't mooned along with the stock.I did buy it them then sold at $58Wow, did you hold them for long before selling? I'm sorry man, that sucksI guess so, that's what I tell myself everyday to feel better. But printer keeps going brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr



I predict here and now in front of all you retards that tesla will one day, for at least one day, be the most valuable company in America before the year 2025. Elon will then have the most tendies and Bezos will be never again be the OG autist. Mark my words for they will become true.Thanks i has no idea! My diamond hands held all the way to 350 and i soldThat math doesn’t check out if i got 100 dollars 10% i get 110 then i get another 10% i have 121i would have more than double by the tenth timeThat double door at Salty lmaoololHehe I know it’s a stretch. I’ll be happy with 4000 in 2 years. 🤣Hmm didn't know  'b'  was in coin.NiceNiceI was hoping for a Thornberry.username checks outCoincidentally, also the price of a ham sandwich.You ever see some really dumb shit and can’t tell whether it’s satire or not?The best time to buy tsla is yesterday, the second best time is today.I had a prof who ran derivatives trading for all of Europe for a large bank before he started teaching and doing deals on the side. Three classroom hours per day is eventually more appealing than 20 hours a day worrying about €100 billion of nominal risk.Yes but no. There are some folks out there that genuinely like what they do.I have a boss at work that showed me his port of 1k shares he said he bought back when they were in the twenties. 

He works a thankless $25/hr job because he enjoys it, even though he clearly doesn’t need it. Might be the case with profs who have good advice; doubly if they’re proffing a relevant field.Who says I didn’t go to an elite schoolBecause there is more to life than stacking bread. 
“Something something... retarded yolo”Please don't go to collegePretty sure one of my professors was literally a billionaire.

&#x200B;

Wasn't that great of a professor though...til about tulipmania, but I feel like thats not what you were talking about.I'll sell ya some putsWell, everyone was declaring Tesla is going to go bankrupt in a year. I was in the red for 3+ months with all my net worth on Tesla. I was happy to come out of that rollercoaster positive. If I had foresight to hold for few more months, I would have come out much richer.Imagine spending $1M on long ass callsMy grandfather used to do that in brazilThis is not incorrectYou only compound if you sell *wink wink*NiceWtf. Didn’t know “username checks out” will get you 60 upvotes. What a s***erYou just described 2020.And at that point the teaching is a side hustle.Had a science teacher with the same mindset. Always said he would walk right out of the building and never come back if the administration pissed him off enoughYour presence here says soI actually own a put on tesla that I'm totally ashamed of, but my plan is to sell when tesla comes back down to 800-1000 and buy my shares back at a premium. Tesla will be the most valuable company in America one day in the next few years in my opinion, but right now it's too expensive for meSadly I also bought a shit ton of 300 strike leaps in June of 19 expiring June of 2020. 


Sold for a modest gain and I don’t want anyone to do the math on what those were worth if I didn’t have paper hands.Bro wants to math when he could be trading tsla calls. Smh.NiceNiceUsername checks outBecause Telsa having a market cap of 60 trillion dollars is pretty fucking crazy, you professional autist.[deleted]Pretty sure teaching is a side hustle for most teachersDon’t certain Ivy League programs get tax breaks for admitting retards, though?NiceI’m bothered.Yeah. I though most professors are there to conduct research and are forced to teach by the department.Like Wharton?Nice.NiceNiceNiceNiceNiceNicePapa Elon if you are reading, show me a sign!Notice how weirdly placed his **3** right hand fingers are.

TSLA 7/31 **$3,000c** ??????He's prolly looking at the kid thinking, "Next version will have built in wifi and auto diaper change"[The sign](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1285816082045865985?s=19)Elon feeling cute Idk might fuck your puts laterDon't call me Papa. Call me Daddy. Who's your Daddy!?Post this with crying baby photoshop if Tesla stays flat after earningsIf they get added to the S&P who gets bumped out?\*goes up 70% in a month\*

\*panics when it corrects 10%\*I can see Elon having the time of his life tonight and tomorrow. If TSLA goes up, he can share in his accomplishments, and make some serious cash. 

If it tanks, he still is going to be up, because he hit his contract bonus (i think it was 12b?) and he will get to read all the drama online.Plz let me suckle your tendies, let me suckle those beautiful tendiesElon, give me gold if TSLA will beat tomorrow.

Actually, I too think Tesla may go bankrupt with at least $1 trillion in market cap.I guess all the car companies running scared like shit with no product to compete with and huge factories that can't just be turned into efficient EV production facilities is no big news?Because unlike most companies, Tesla actually makes money and is *actually* growing exponentially. 

Explain how Lyft or Uber is worth more than zero?

Tesla's stock could drop to zero today and their company would still be the world's largest, most in-demand supplier of electric cars producing more than any other EV maker.... That's why.>no big news

Now, if you had a daughter, it's likely that if she had a son, that son would be very likely to have similar hair to yourself.Keep backtracking lmao delusionalEven in a highly volatile stock with a wide spread of predicted motion, the most likely outcome is horizontal (flat). Imagine a normal distribution with a wide spread (+-200pts). The most likely outcome is the middle of that distribution (0pts).

This all assumes the distributions is normal and not bi-modal... but I"m 99% sure whatever assumptions went into that "expected move" calculation assumed normality.

Downvotes? Am I wrong? Educate me.ok COTY puts seem to be beating everything else in my portfolio today. Not a ton of money but the $ action so far is in the right directionP49D, babyTheir stock really isn’t indicative of supply and demand, it really is more indicative of people’s hopes and dreams lol and it really is paying off but no one is realizing their gains so eventually their has to be losers. 

The market is almost pricing in that every car on the road will be Tesla, every solar panel will be Tesla. But the balance sheet/income statement isn’t showing this.

This has to get bloody at some point and people will hate Elon although he said this has already gone too far -53% ago lmaoAhh, forcing their workers to come back during explicit county-wide lockdown seemed a little panicky to me.You still feel bad?Why? because they are making more than you?I said "big" news. Of course theres been positive news, but it's the kind of positive news that's been business as usual for Tesla for several years now. Or its papa Elon tweeting something. Nothing that justifies such a large sustained rise in price.That’s not how stock prices and valuations work. If Tesla stock dropped to zero it wouldn’t have value. I can sell cars that are “highly in demand”, but if I don’t make and money on them, I don’t have a sustainable business. Suggesting that demand for the autos is the driver here shows you do not comprehend the connection between stock price and company value. You’re not alone, which is why I am not missing this opportunity. Please keep buying TSLA with your “profits”.Nothanks, my next step is take a step back for some time, going on a vacation domestically (I live and work in Taiwan so it's quite safe and orderly even during this global epidemic), and looking at non-profits to donate to.Shake that 🐻Elon simps have that same weird cult energy thoughIs that a call or put?

https://www.bosley.com/blog/do-you-inherit-hair-loss-from-your-father-or-your-mothers-side/

Even at face value it makes no fucking sense based on the 50/50 gene split.Cry more.The point is the only thing that will drag this stock down is a loss of demand causing losses that depletes cash until bankruptcy.

If tesla has strong demand, there is nothing dragging the stock price down.  Future value will keep creeping in and it will only go up.Not only does Tesla’s stock rely on the hopes and dreams of we lesser men, but I think people take into considerations Elon’s other companies. People are excited about the boring company, solarcity (obviously merged but tesla powerwall and stuff like that gets people hyped). Every time elon sells a limited edition item like s3xy underwear boom.Their demand is so high they can't keep up with production. That's why he is building giga factories everywhere while the competition still has shit to show for. What will be really bloody is the car companies once the taxpayers get tired of bailing their asses out.And a massive short squeezeDo you know what a convertible note is?What the hell are you talking about?

Those people are free to shop at walmart and work, schools being closed are the exception here.

But that is also meaningless.  Even if we had full shelter in place with no one allowed to go shopping, that has no bearing on schools.

Schools should open if they can implement safe protocols within the building with real data to back up that the transmission rates are low.  Schools should have been testing their protocols all summer.  If they failed to come up with a working protocol, then schools cannot open.

Schools are unique because procedures to prevent spreading can be implemented from the bus in the morning to the bus in the afternoon.  If transmission risk can be mitigated while the child is under control of the school, schools can open.

>forcing their workers to come back 

Here is a great litmus test, any teacher that thinks going straight to online without meeting in person first and training students has given up.  That teacher just doesn't care and knows no one will learn.  Teachers that want 1-2 weeks in person before going online actually give a shit and know meeting in person for younger grades is critical for it to work in any way.  Obvioulsly online is less effective the lower the grade, but if we have to do online, you want to do everything you can to make online work better.Yes. Of course. No question.Nope. Not the reason, or the case. I feel bad for them for throwing their money away.welcome to robinhood>I can sell cars that are “highly in demand”, but if I don’t make and money on them, I don’t have a sustainable business.

No you can't sell cars that are "highly in demand." Lots of companies have tried selling cars and have failed.

Tesla has succeeded. They have also made money on every car, but have reinvested in future growth.> If Tesla stock dropped to zero it wouldn’t have value. I can sell cars that are “highly in demand”, but if I don’t make and money on them, I don’t have a sustainable business.

Except that Tesla DOES make money when it sells a car. 

Are you suggesting that the multiple gigafactories and years of orders would somehow be effected by the price of a piece of paper???? 

You have no idea how REALITY works. Go back to r/stocks so you can circle jerk about Greeks and imaginary knowledge.YesThat’s a rare meme but real ones know 😏shure and would you like fries with that?Cheers for this, didn't actually know. Although your source doesn't really go into genetics as much as I'd liked. I had to get a lot of information elsewhere.Edit: It’s pointless to argue with bigly smart armchair science retards. Yeah, there are a lot of factors that affect baldness. Read into them what you will. 🍻Oh, if someone else gets to market with a driverless system that is actually being used then there could be a die off. Similarly if a battery tech comes along that is better and out of their control. The whole business is priced based on a lot of speculative future earnings and a massive amount of investor confidence. Sometimes that can be a little sketchy.You didn’t read my comment.

Much like tech companies, Tesla’s stock isn’t based on demand but future expectations 

If hype dies off, which is what is keeping it going right now, Tesla will drop like a rockLol okas if tax payers decide who to bail outWhat? I'm talking about a historical event at this point. April? Nobody could open, it wasn't debatable, and Tesla did.Never confuse being a good trader with being in a bull market.>They have also made money on every car, but have reinvested in future growth.

BINGO. 

Tesla is a REAL company, the share price has NO effect on them (as evidenced by Elon saying "Tesla share price too high imo") except that they wouldn't be able to just print money whenever they wanted.Unfortunately that is reality. Sears had lots of buildings and years of sales too. As a public company, the price of a piece of paper is exactly what dictates it’s value. And I’m not arguing- right now that’s some very expensive paper!so basically calls..Cold beer and wings would do. Can you make wings ...Feel free to link a respected source then because all you're doing is repeating the same talking points for that myth while apparently shit talking one of the largest hair organizations that employs MDs and PHDs.

>Actually, patterns of baldness are inherited from many genes, which can come from both sides of the familyI'm pretty sure Ford are focusing heavily on both of these right now.>Oh, if someone else gets to market with a driverless system that is actually being used then there could be a die off. 

That isn't possible.  It is completely impossible for anyone to have a system in pure secrecy that is better or even close to anything tesla is doing.

>Similarly if a battery tech comes along that is better and out of their control.

It isn't feasible because if there is a tech tesla doesn't control, why would another car company control it?  Car companies farm out r&d to 3rd parties, so if gm can buy someone's 3rd party battery, so can tesla.  Tesla has contracts with every battery supplier already, they are going to have dibs due to their existing relationships and their much higher volumes.  Meanwhile other car companies have no access to tesla chemistries.  This also ignores that two companies with the same chemistry won't even have the same performance or longevity.  The software controllers for the batteries are tweaking power in and out of the battery thousands of times a second to increase performance, charging rates, and longevity.  Anyone using tesla chemistries will still have to do all the research to tune the battery controllers on their own.

>The whole business is priced based on a lot of speculative future earnings and a massive amount of investor confidence. Sometimes that can be a little sketchy.

Stocks are always gambling, that is no different than any other investment.  Tesla just has a lot of growth potential, so it stands out more.All stock is based on demand.  Tesla would crash if they only sold 30k cars when the expectation was 100k.

Tesla has reached the minimum amount of demand needed to keep the compay near a break even point and even profitable in some Qs.  That is a floor that prevents the stock just crashing.  They won't have any major losses in any Qs and will still be expanding new stuff.Because I am biased by saying "a company that breaks even on existing operations, has billions in the bank, and can fund all the r&d it wants" isn't going bankrupt?How old are you? You vote for people that represent you. If those that you vote for don't represent you but you still keep voting for them, shits on you. Like a woman complaining about all men being assholes, but likes bad boys...Here's the original comment: 

>People still bullish on $TSLA like going up 500% in a year with no big news is somehow normal. They're insane

My point is that Tesla *is* valued so highly *because* it's share price is *not* what gives it value. 

But go ahead: short Tesla and tell me how that goes LMFAOThe entire auto industry basically dropped everything they're doing 2-3 years ago and started plowing all of their available cash and manpower into EVs and automation. They are all still doing that today- 1 Eventually. Driverless tech isn't a sprint.
- 2 Not just car companies. Not by a long shot. No one even cares about the cars. Batteries for the sake of batteries are more important.
- 3 Sure, lots of growth potential and lots more needed for the price justificationYou talk a big game, but do you even know how battery chargers work?if a politician represents your interests you're either rich or dumb. US is a demonstrated oligarchy where the views of the masses have little impact on public policy.But now you are saying tesla may have a competitor in 10 years.   Wild speculation generally doesn't matter.  But even if you think they will have competition in 10 years for sure, you would be comparing 2030 tesla with 10 years of success and expansion against the small remnants of vw releasing something that matches tesla exactly(still not realistic).  Even if someone else matches tesla, that only makes them a competitor, simply matching a competitor doesn't mean you are going to draw their customers away.  If vw  has to sell what tesla has for less price to survive, that won't be a strong competitor.If you are implying software doesn't enable faster charging speeds, then lol!

A lithium ion battery would destroy itself (imbalance) without software that controls the charging for each individual cell.  The sofware that controls the charge and discharge of the batteries is more important than trying to tweak chemistry for any improvements.I wouldn't bother with him, he's an Elon simp and clearly betting his farm on Tesla. 

The other people who responded to him laid out solid arguments and he's just repeating useless rhetoric that he heard someone say on CNBC.Well, then you are just saying how stupid the public is for voting against its own interest despite knowing the politicians don't represent their interest.Tesla isn't a car company and never has been. They are just there for cash flow until they hit it big in either driverless tech or battery tech. Or miss of course, they could always miss.Im not implying anything about batteries, what im implying is you dont know what the fuck you are talking about. If you, please enlighten me(since we are on the subject) of how you balance the individual cells.Only the people who use the word simp in unrelated convo are simps.  You just want to project.I actually don't blame the average person. Millions upon millions of dollars are spent to keep them angry and planted firmly on one side or the other so that our leaders can rig the economy to extract money from the middle and lower income strata. It is not their fault that they are stuck in partisan trench warfare. Entire industries are devoted to keeping them there. Is it a coincidence that the Rs and Ds have the same mega donors? Or that despite popular opinion, US doesn't have a form of universal healthcare? Or that every elected president says they want to reduce foreign wars, but put us in more to the benefit of the military industrial complex? Or that healthcare companies are the most profitable businesses in several states despite US having worse health outcomes than most developed countries? The system is working as designed and a handful are benefiting. Most just trust the leaders we have and trust the system and act in good faith based on a foundation of American values. The problem is our elite know how things really work and are using that to their benefit exclusively.But the cars will lose the company money if they lose money.  Tesla is strong right now because they don't have to covrer car production losses with new investment.  New investment goes all into actual r&d.That is funny, you challenged my knowledge, I gave a basic explanation, and now you go into full vapid mode.

If you don't understand the words people like me post, the issue is you, not society.Nicely done. What's next, " I'm rubber you're glue..."If intelligence is not at fault here, then how come we are immune and see the manipulations of the political system? I'm certainly no millionaire (yet!).   


If the people are stupid and care more for lies than reality, it will be reflected in the votes. Politicians aren't stupid or evil, they just know what their voters want to hear.What basic explanation? Nowhere in any of your posts is there an explanation of anything. Also, what do you mean, people like you? You mean full on window lickers like you? Dude, face it, you wouldnt be able to explain it if you had a textbook in front of you. Its ok, electronics isnt everyones cup of tea. Its ok not to know how electricity works, plenty of people dont and you arent alone in that. If you ever do want to learn though, id be happy to help, and dont worry ill make sure to speak slow for you:)a glitch in the matrix? beats me. consuming independent news instead of cable certainly contributed my current views. Also, if an authority figure tells you something you're likely to believe it unless you have some evidence to the contrary from your personal life or something. I go out of my way to listen to views of both right and left. If you only get one side, then nothing ever contradicts and you don't have to think, only believe?

By "care for" you mean they like the lies? Of course they do, otherwise the lies wouldn't work. I'm not saying they know they are lied to though. Also via the media, the elite (media, politicians, wealthy) inform us what we want to hear. It's not like we (average american) decides what is important in a vacuum and then go see if the politicians will say it. That's the industry part. They manufacture your desire then give it to you. At least in part and the less you think about it the better. Were your outraged about Clinton's emails when you first heard or not until weeks and weeks of endless 24hr coverage? Do you really care about Trump's phone call with Ukraine, or is that a media ploy to wip up rage and distraction while BOTH parties vote to expand military budget and give tax cuts to rich? The Ukraine case is perfect because while Pelosi decries Trump as a puppet of Russia, the dems vote to give Trump more missiles to launch/sell to whoever he wants.

Another factor in the system of control is the two party system. The elite get to decide the two options presented and you "have" to pick. You can see if on both political sides right now. This election is existential, you can't afford to vote Bernie cause you might get Trump another term!! or if Biden wins its socialism and the end of the world and America! In reality, Biden and Trump are a hairs breadth apart on economic issues and guess what, the rich will still get richer.

I could go on, but this is wsb lol.lolHm ok, but you're still saying the voters are too stupid to think and just believe. I don't see how that is not the very definition of stupidity.

&#x200B;

I myself don't care for superficial things. If Trump gets pissed on by some hookers who gives a shit. I care about policy. Although I'm german, not really invested but every country is the same, always a big part is stupid dumbfuck voters who always vote the same, because they have always done so in the past...stupid dumbfucks. And the same idiots are the loudest when the consequences they directly voted for impact their life negatively.Now to 140k!! You got thisHow many kids do you have?

Robinhood just calls everything investing so 90% of their gamblers that attempt to trade always say they’re investing in their posts and it’s hilarious.

Although I do see your point.Same. My 2020 chart is going to hilarious looking back.Yep, tuition for stock investing is steeeeeppp!  The lessons ain't cheap!Only if he sell, next timeFuck the way, the empire is grabbing trendies while you Jedi scum fuck with the force.I was actually out for a little bit at the top, this is a number of plays since February or thereabouts.You're my spirit animal, or maybe I'm yours. I trust MSFT but it doesn't stop me from losing my mind. It isn't right.It was just open seasonU can see it, to see how long it takes on the way back to homeI have a death wish.I spat my drink while reading this. Well put.I used to think my life was a tragedy.

But, now I realize it's a comedy.You know what sub this is rightI see this so many times. No one ever cashes ANY profit out and then they end up losing it all. Greed is powerful.Need the right market conditions. If market consistently moves up or down people can make easy money. When they try to trade a flat and choppy market that's when they lose it all.Greed.I am independently wealthy.  This is not my bank account lmao.Extreme luck.It started with a TSLA call I bought for 1k that turned a 20k profit after that it was rounds of puts during the crash and then a few bull plays during the recovery.  The recent chop is what killed me.Hydrogen infrastructure is shit compared to electric.He would have said exactly this.I made a supersonic man out of myself.The environment for making this kind of money with relative ease is gone and will likely not come back for another 10 years (next crash), sorry to say.  We might crash sooner depending on the world situation.He never gave upMake this man a mod.

This is amazing.You mean on the way up and downcall options lolNKLA puts to 140kDo you know what leverage isit's really more like 20k to 70k considering that first 1k to 20k was pure luckGrindrHe had a 6900% return on his moneyacrewIts make more sense to gamble itWsb cred?I was cash and lost it on other plays.>You guys do a lot of advanced shit I don't understand

Jokes on you, NOBODY around here understands what they're doingI'm hoping to eventually get that $3I to $10k after posting a half million.Oh you are for sure challenged.You pissed away $70k for a challenge?It was a prank bro.Call it “a guide to bankruptcy”Amateurs, 230k pissed awayWatch him come back -$140k lmao😂A better challenge would have been to make it keep going upSo, you like to be mentally challenged?Yeah sure budCan I participate in the part where you lose money to me?That's my kind of edgeThe good old rope a dope! Sec will never catch on if you lose 97% randomly then build it back up making 1k at a time!This guy fucks.What'd you buy for the 1k to 70k?Do you think saying shit like this makes you look less retarded to us?Nice!Consumer confidence doesThanks, Autistic Einstein, we all can fucking see the pattern.So more than you care to know :DLooks like you were a victim of Gandalf Raping Day several times over the past few monthsBro my account is the opposite of yours lol. Mine shits as that's your highest then also my highest when you down down. We should cooperate and make some playsDad ?.....I came here for this.Life is all about timely pullouts bruhOscar you’re gayMe and my boy OP will roast you

Edit: and in case it wasn't clear enough we will high five while doing it.dad? is that you?Talk about yourself I’ve been in red all weekMaybe 1% of the autists in here are taking the rest of our money> [now its our money.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U06jlgpMtQs)So if I create charts while betting on black, I'm suddenly investing?Gaming (Gambling) statistician here, can confirm. Much more charts and lines lolYou clearly have never seen the amount of charts poker players have.Not the same at all options have time limits at are extremely difficult to get right.
If you own stocks you can wait them out to make money.If you’re dumb yesSeriously though if you cap 100k, take 50k out and buy some blow. Or save it. But that would be sound advice, and sound advice is illegal here.Glad someone realised the pattern...you need to get good at reading charts my boiMade it all on puts during the crash.  SPCE, UBER, SPY, CCL, and M were my favorites. INO calls.  Did some work on the way up in SPY, APPL, and TWLO calls.  Lost it all in the chop as I was pretending to be a day trader and not just someone who got insanely lucky a few times.

Forgot to mention: I started my account with 10k to see what I could do.  Got down to 1k in January and YOLO'd on a single TSLA call which netted me 20k in 2 trading days.  That was the seed money for that first round of crash puts.Now he just needs a once in a century pandemic to help get those price movements.I always go for the YOLO. gets me from broke to rich every timeIf you didn't transfer it into your regular bank account is it even really real money? 🤷‍♂️Lots of MSFT? My calls are down 68% over 2 weeks. 

I was like "Yay they beat earnings!......Why is it plummeting? Well surely tomorrow they'll bounce.....ok, down again, tomorrow we shoot up!......Damn it."le sex number xDr/redditmomentNot sure if the technicals support 2k. It's forming an autistic wedge. If it crosses this plane, it could fall as low as 29 centsHe's got it right. Why are yall so math illiterate? Oh right, sorry forgot what sub I'm in.His trend is the only one that makes sense... 10k — 1k — 70k — 2k. The trend is that the odd sequences (1st and 3rd) are multiplied by 7, so the 5th one would be 490k. And the even ones are double, so after 490k is 4k.

These kids cant fucking hang with my mathsDid someone say Jenga?Found Eminem's real reddit account, boysYes. But he does indeed get the screenshot in this scenario, right?Its not adding $70k each time, its 7.0x. Otherwise he would've been at $80k instead of $70k.

$10k to $70k to $490k and then keep multiplying by 7.

1k to 2k to 3k to 4k etc.

Fucking morons on this sub.You numbskullYou are poorSee you in about 10 years08, 2020, we're bound for more in the next 20 yeatsRight so to you 70k is just a play thing, thanks for solidifying my point lolUnderstandable.

Also, no idea who's downvoting ya, but you deserve better.I mean which one mainly? tesla?Acrughe*I didn't realize this was your whole portfolio mb and sorry for the loss. 
Im a pussy and only have dividend positions I find these charts you guys post fascinating and scaryThis is the best fuckin joke ive read all dayI love this sub.I just laughed so hard I farted.Yeah if the challenge was losing his ass he definitely showed themAren't we all?I love this fucking sub! I love it so goddamn much!FYou’re not lying lolllHahahahahahaha.....HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA I ACTUALLY LAUGHED OUT LOUD. good work, brotherLolol mentally challenged for sure.  LolI’m sure that’s what he has to tell himself in order to not jump off a buildingThe challenge was getting every retard in wsb to believe this is realShould have pissed on some masked strippers instead.Staying alive is a challenge I guessI passed away 2X that amount and still standing.  Don't mind them, they will all be singing the same song somedayNah. He's getting ready for 140kI was only pretending to be retarded.So far only 8k is pissed away lolDamn sorry. Have you posted loss porn?The pattern would actually be $490,000 next.

You're all retarded.I think also more than he can affordIf you know you knowOh shit Whitest Kids U Know reference!But wasn’t that the one day where they stopped raping Gandalf?Kevin, I couldn't decide between a fat joke or a dumb jokeAndy you're even gayer than Oscarr/unexpectedofficeRoast boysSpit roast himIf you really want it. Yes> [now it's our money.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2019/10/16/billionaires-have-a-lot-to-fear-from-bernie-sanders-tax-plan-infographic/amp/)Correct. It's DD at that point.Stocks only go up or down its 50/50I amI turned 30k into 80k then withdrew 25k, just to blow up my account now I have 12k. 100% glad I withdrew when I was high!At wsb, we find unique patterns to bet on.Nice, don’t look at it as a 97% loss, you doubled your money from 1k-2k!!!> Lost it all in the chop as I was pretending to be a day trader and not just someone who got insanely lucky a few times.

I feel this on a deep personal level. $25k -> $$175k -> -$30k... Still reeling from that.How did you turn 1k into 70k what was the position??What chop? I feel you though my brother.  Think you can pull it off again?For the record TWLO has been killing it.  It's still up now with this market correction.  One of the few keeping me greenMeaning you did close to expiry plays? Or just kept cutting losses on bad option plays?Kinda the same for me. I go from broke to more broke. 😂Unfortunately only available in round trip tickets.I can't even begin to tell you how many times I've had something like a boring ass 50 dollar option trade explode to like 500 bucks... And all I can think is "let this mother fucker ride to the moon!"

I've lost it all every time. Yet I keep doing it.Seriously, we're all playing a video game until you click the sell button and transfer it to your bankRobinhood black cardIt’s all like playing a video game to meThat's one F strong mindset....damnYeah I don’t know how I missed the dumb ass and shoulders pattern there, I think you’re rightNo one got it wrong, they are just thinking different things, semantically.

Anyone saying it will go to 140k is thinking that the next step is to get another 70k above the first 70k (doubling, it).

Anyone saying 490k is taking the ratio between what was invested (10k) to what was gained (70k), which is 7. And applying the same ratio to 70k you get 490k.

Although if 70k was after an investment of 10k, and since OP now only have 2k, the next peak should be 14k heheyes i suppose you're rightyou’ll never with an argument with an idiotAccurate, one in a decadebuy BLNK... thank me laterBoth usernames check outI don't think it was a jokeThis actually made me lol 😂😂I just faurted so hard I laghedI shidded and fardedUnderstandableCoping mechanism 🚨🚨[deleted]Oh wow, someone on WSB promoting mask wearing... How socially responsible!Worked for the Bee Gees, but that was a different era to be fair.It’s easy to stay standing, but you’re a fucking moron stillhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8yh0u/any_one_wanna_fill_up_their_spank_bank_there_you/I got a lead pipe in my hand that say this old fuck ain't magicI like to think that Gandalf, in the malaise of near-constant rape to death's door, only has a chance to reflect on how horrible his life is on Gandalf Raping Day. That's why I think the OP probably has that feeling every time he opens his Robinhood since April.Meredith you've had sex with so many men you're starting to look like a man boom, roasted.Sweet were goin to VegasHigh on what?I'm swimming in it!But he started at $10k... so it's still an 80% loss lol😍But actually lost 8K.LOL that's the way to look at itMy first nut was a single TSLA call that I bought for my last 1k back in Jan/Feb.  TSLA went up 150 points within the next two trading days and I sold that one for 20k.  I had 20k for puts leading into the crash which I played at various times: UBER, M, SPY, CCL, etc.  Basically got lucky like 5 or 6 times and then I lost it all trying to reproduce my luck.AdrenalinWhat a great mindset!That’s how it feels likeHis 1k did also go to 70k though, so you could average it and get with 38.5×2k=77kHmmm they seem to be doing badly 🤔I hear yaI just laughed so farted I hardThats a covid symptomI’m hardDamn this sub is full of terrible people

But I love itJust got Corona reading this shitHe said the strippers had masks on, he didnt say he was wearing one.Damn sorry. 

Oops you aren’t him. Thanks for posting.Boromir!They are still in a partial lock down, so you're going to have to wait till next year. However, HUGE supply of out of work sex workers. Haven't seen deals like this since the 50s.High on tendies!High on potnuseYou’re still doing better than Warren Buffett and Renaissance  🙂Why...you could buy anything! Even options!🤫🤫🤫No because he had 1k and now he's got 2k so he's made some money.

You're looking at this from the wrong angle.Not if he sets a different time frame on robinhood. Gainz boyYes and to have 10k you first have to have 1k so clearly he doubled his money since before he had 10k. It is simple math.Was your TSLA call out of the money and close to expiration? 

Ive been making ok returns on slightly OTM options 2 months out but I never see those 10x gains. I wanna step up my autism game lolNah I think it’s more stuff like this. I always want to keep risking it so I can catch that whale just one time.For the tards here, sure...I just harded so fart I laughedA masked stripper party? Count me inTwo for one?Just get in the medallion fund, it’s super easy.

Just need to be Robert Mercer’s kidDo you find it fishy that Renaissance insider fund always perform well but their public funds is very average?Up 1k!!The TSLA call was 3 weeks out but keep in mind this was a different market.  When I sold it I was only a week in.Haha, I feel youI just got hardHolup! so u farted out of your mouth?I just harded you right in the fart and am laughing.Yeah but that’s just wasting perfectly good cocaine on a third wheel. Just take one good one half offWell I am currently looking for a new daddy...Well I'm glad they printed at the time! You'll get back up there.I’m taking a poo and I’m poopingI’ll be your daddy if you provide the sugarI’m just laughingShares???Wouldn't it be funny if the stock mooned after the earnings release, but then plummeted after the earnings call.THATS WHATS FUCKIN UP B. THEY SAID BUY PUTS. I SAID FUCK YOU. MY WIFES BOYFRIEND IS IN THE CORNER CRYING RNI wish I were as rich as half of the people on this subHey man, I don't touch TSLA because I don't understand it - but if you're making money I'm happy for you.

Congrats.#SCHWABB GANGAnybody else listening to the earning call hear the rant about needing to increase nickel mining? anyone tell me where I can blindly throw a shitload of money at to ensure I'm rich shortly? How do I play in nickel?If you want, you can DM me and I can tell you what you should have done a week ago to make money.I had 200 @$250 😭These fuckers told me not to buy a $650 1/2021 call in March. Lesson: Don’t listen to anything this sub says. Maybe even do the opposite.Downvoted for shares. This is a fucking casino. If it’s not options or penny stock yolos, we don’t want to see it.Nice. you jinxed urself 💯Dam man how much of your net worth did you put into tsla? I’m kicking myself for not throwing most of my money at it. Would be in the same club as you, congrats.I happily sold at 1000. I annoy my wife every day with the current Share price.How’s it looking today?I mean at some point you really should sell. Congrats if you do sell at that profit.I bought in at $225.

I’m just gonna hold like PLNHF that I bought 15k shares at $1.70. :)Big balls man.

Not financial advice, but remember you can always hedge going forward to make sure you keep it.

Wtf? Is this a bug with reddit or my internet carrier? Congratulations!MonkSome titfuckers on here told me to sell my shares when TSLA was at $900. Who’s laughing now bozos?I

&#x200B;

Then i look at guys on wsb who have the same cost basis as i do  D:If anyone is still looking into owning tsla stock I’d suggest selling puts over the next few weeks until they get exercised. You could make a bunch of premium before actually buying it and then use it to buy moreplay it safe broWishing I was you right nowEVEN LOWER TODAY!!!I’ll be honest what is AHr/boomer content right hereNICEHey you know what fuck you that what suck me off with those tendies.What is this bullshit and where is robinhoodLol relax. We’re at....... last Friday levelsThe crash down to 1k will make you look like an idiot but hey congrats. All the good news came out and the stock is exhausted imho. The gravy train always ends at some point but what do I knowI bought in at 1529 bro, I believe in papa Elon and this bitch is going to 20k by the time I retire lolShares???

Go back to r/Investing 

Only 100% ?? That's what people make in a couple hours trading options.... I came back for lunch one day and my premium was up like 50%We are in total hype/fomo/delusion mode.  So keep on keeping on to a point.  Reality will hit.  Short term trade the fuck out of Tesla.  It probably is going to $2000.  But hold it long term?  You gotta be a fucking idiot.  Tesla, a car company, has a market cap of \~ $320 billion with $30 billion in revenue.  Ford, a car company, has a market cap of $26 billion with $160 billion in revenue.  Tesla has to grow it's revenues 33% a year for 6 straight years just to match Ford's revenue.  And the competition IS coming.  Including Chinese EVs some using NVIDIA's AI/self driving system.  And they have specs closer to a Model S and they are going to price closer to the Model 3.  Never mind Nissan with 8 models coming, Ford with electric F-150 and Mustangs.  Rivian, Fisker, Nikola.  Plenty more coming.  Good luck keeping profit margins up.  And Tesla cars have shitty reliability.  There's a reason this is a difficult and unprofitable industry.  And good luck convincing people to go to EVs as the price of gasoline steadily drops over the next decade.  You just saw what happened to the price of oil when demand dropped.  There will be a large cohort that will see sub $1.50/gallon gas and say fuck no I'm not switching.  And you think it's friction-less to get an EV?  Especially if you live in an apartment.  Where are you going to charge it?  Or even if you have a home, where are you going to install the charging station?

I love Tesla and what Musk is doing to push the world forward.  But the stock?  It's in the retardosphere.[deleted]It is up because I pussied out on buying the 7/24 $1590 call this afternoon (for, at the time, $94 per contract)...  you're welcome.You have shares, but these are option returns.
I’ll allow it.Which app/ site are you using? Sorry newbie question :Dmost of these autist here have no idea what an investing is. Its all just puts and calls casino bs for them :)You only have ten more shares than the last time you posted though.Tesla was at $1,592 when the market closed, and has risen $65 after hours to $1,657.

I have 8 total call options: For some reason my stoned ass thought 8 calls x 100 shares x 65$ rise per share which would be $52,000?  But i feel like that is not how it goes at all.  Someone help a fellow autist out.

They are worth more than Ford, GM, Chrysler, and even Disney and they dont even make 1% of the profit Disney makes. 

Sometimes bad stocks can continue to go up, but eventually itll pop and Tesla will be back down to $300 a share. Or $50 a share where it belongs.how did that turn out?Oh, hi, me.

At least you didn't take a loss.You sold at $420 didn't youWhat did you sell atConsidering that no one gets rich from listening to actual financial advisors, WSB autists.... lol> Don’t listen to anything this sub says. Maybe even do the opposite.

If everything said was wrong it would very valuable information. Instead it's right about 50% of the time, might as well flip a coin.What was the premium back then?how much was it per share at that time?I sincerely hope that no one actually takes what I say seriously whenever I tell someone what to do with their money.Penny stocks ain’t welcome bro. You just took a L co-signing garbage.Take my upvoteCan you imagine if he put the same amount of money in calls? He’d be a billionaire.Meme stonks tho^ this mother fucker is so jealousWe accept penny stock YOLOs here??Penny stocks are the worst, heretic!*or pre-merger SPACsThis is stupid. Tesla shares get you option like gains with less risk. Sorry your broke ass can’t afford a shareIn his defense with that wad of money they may as well be penny stocks.Lol TSLA was over 1700 for all of 2 minutesHis next post: You told me to sell. I should've taken the fucking money!I stopped heavily investing in Wealthfront and started buying into Tesla in January.Just buy when it “dips” to 500-600Just use the time machine... That's how OP got his money...It’s aging just like the rest of the market.Danger to manifold!Fuck you Karen!They aren’t shares they’re stonks and I would thank you to understand that mr wizard.Gonna add moreDo the math. Except I took this opportunity to Backdoor some shares to my Roth.Nikola bulls lolPeople that foolishly have faith in market regulators and Congress to do their job.Oil. Other car companies.Perfect opportunity to backdoor some shares to my Roth.I keep seeing that stock because financial education/Jeremy on YouTube. Is it worth it? What's the draw to it?These are shares, the only go upThis is probably not the right sub for you.Stock is up 7%, the call premium was more than thatYes. It’s the next level after LEAPsSeriously. Someone is bidding $420 to buy a 7/24 $3,500 call. Take their money, have a fucking 3 star steak dinner delivered on Friday night and leave your Door Dash delivery person a $100 tip. 

What’s the worst thing that can happen?— oh nooo you have to sell 100 shares at $3,500 a pop. You’d look like such an idiot.So tell me how selling way OTM naked puts on TSLA isn’t free money right now0 because I don’t sell.TaxesIn IRA.Yeah, who the fuck buys shares in here?Of course not.No. High? Buy. Low? Buy. Flat? Buy.

Nowhere do the instructions say sell. That’s how you lose money, delete Robinhood and end up on WSB.Or instead of giving money to Reddit I can use that money to buy more you fuckwad.The fuck are you smokingUsername checks outAmAzOn Is JuSt A bOoKsToRe!!!!!!Who’s holding Microsoft through earnings?Been buying since January, so the average cost goes up.After hours.That was a good timr to sell, even better nowI also use schwab. "This is what it looks like when you delete robinhood" LOLThis works for people with 100k plus in the their accounts, not 99% of WSBYes! Got more, AND converted some to Roth.User name is a lieThanks bro, making everyone else rich one dime at a timeNoob.TFW you think Tesla is just a car company.Go away, TrevorHahahaha salty bear right here.The real question is: Did we also fake the moon landing?Go back to r/realtesla where you belong.>You're too sensible for this sub but I've also been hearing of decreased Tesla registrations in major states like California. It doesn't add up.Honestly, you might be happy you didn't buy.  Tsla is currently 1655 so 65 intrinsic + time premium, I have a hard time believing the premium stays that high now that earnings is out.  

Anyways, if TSLA hits 8k tomorrow, I'll buy you some rope.it was $94 or $9400?SchwabUser name checks outI believe charles schwabI would brag if I had one share of BRK.AYour basically retiredDontNo whereThis is what Robinhood looks like after you deleteWTF is all the green color, mine never looks like thatIt’s glitchy.It's Schwab, not Robinhood.That’s Charles Schwab 🙄From IrelandIrish Republican Army?Independent Research Accountant.

ur a national treasureTil you try to supercharge near a national parkThey make amazing cars.  They're beautiful, they're technologically advanced.  They're definitely the future.  However, Toyota sold more cars in the first quarter of 2020 than Tesla has made in its entire existence.  There is no rational reason that Tesla has a market cap 3x larger than Toyota.stock values dont just go to infinity because you like someones product. they have to be profiting and growing.You’re obviously not a car person.I have a 2020 toyota corolla with openpilot installed.

Bought some as he mentioned it. No options available on RH thoLook at $PSM pre market.  I believe they are a mining supplier for the new gigafactory.Is that something I can hold LONG?Great insight.What was the move partner?I bought 2000 dollars worth of Walton at 20$. Also bought about 500 Chainlink at 70 cents. One is now worth under 50c and the other over 8$.
If i had all inned on Chainlink i would be at the moon in my lambo$320, didn't think it would get there. 😒That is the truth, financial advisors are actually usually pretty useless. WSB autists are the tits though. I live my life one WSB at a time.You don’t get rich by listening to them but you can make money by being them and dish out useless advice.Fair enough.$11k 😭I don’t remember exactly but toward the bottom. Under $500, I think.I sold options on penny stocks.  I have been getting Ws with that.Tbh with the crazy IV TSLA options had, shares were the move if you had a bullish sentiment but not an extremely bullish outlook for earningsTESLA calls are so expensive it’s basically break even with shares.No we fucking don’tI mean we're looking at a TSLA thread.>Can you imagine if he put the same amount of money in calls? He’d be a billionaire.

tbf if he is as much of an idiot as alot of the people here he'd probably by FDs instead of call debit spreads or long dated options and as a result he'd never be able to profit due to the IVSmart man. What’s your next decision? Hold, sell a few shares?What happened in Jan that made you decide to go almost all in like that? That's a helluva risk, even by high risk standards (but, not on WSB of course).buy the dipThat’s where I learned about it. I’m up 50% since I started buying a few months ago. So far it’s worth it. I kind of just go with his advice. I’m just going to hold it for a long time and see what happens.Edit: can to can't

And IV is going to crassshhhhh tomorrow.  Also, doesn't matter what is happening after hours if you have options, can't trade them until the market opens.it's after hours. wait till volume tomorrow morningYeah I’m honestly struggling to see the downside here. That really does look like some idiot putting $400 in front of you and walking away.And if you sold at 3500 you could still use the 420 to buy dinner for your wife's boyfriend.Also could have sold when it hit 17xx last time, bought back in at 1500, back up again, plus the covered calls.. probably 50k in opportunity?I think its 42 not 420The worst that could happen is he has to hold on to a crazy volitile stock until Aug7 (I'm assuming that's the one you are talking about) for a .4% RoI. If he's going to hold them anyway, sure, why not. But it's definitely not free moneyYou're me, except richer.Is it that you'd actually get screwed, or just the net gain after tax would be low enough you don't care for the hassle?

Or a "put credit spread" if you think the stock will stay the same or go up

Buying spreads allows you to buy puts/calls close to ATM with only a small amount of capital/ risk. It does cap your winnings, but especially buying credit spreads is a great way to hedge your account or play options with less capitalWhat's an FD?Woman stonks are expensive.Im fucking and loadingDid a full day trip around Mt Rainier National park, visited both visitor centers. 224 miles single charge, plenty of charge left to explore more or accidentally get lost.Beautiful tho?  Them things need an overhaul.  They got 12yr old body styles.And they fall apart in winter.Tesla has a fundamentally different approach to their products than anyone else. I would never touch their stock just because of how volatile Elon is, but I find it somewhat unfair to compare their valuation to Toyota. Tesla’s attitude towards cars, not just their current products, are what give them such an advantageCome back when you realize Tesla isn’t a company that makes only cars.You must be new hereOk then buy puts 🐻

Edit for the salty downvotes:
Tesla is profiting and growing. Remember how all you guys said “OH AMZN SUCKS IT ISNT PROFITING”... but it was growing. TSLA is eeking out profits while it’s growing *in the middle of a recession*.

Don’t like TSLA? Don’t buy it or buy puts. But in reality TSLA is fine and isn’t going to $400 any time soon.You will quickly realize that you have a bladder and large intestine if you want to try and outrun the battery.Refugee?We did, I had to put my tendies in the freezer though.Ever go to a strip club and ponder if a nine dollar ATM fee is worth it? not with usaa.

WSB is just as clueless.Fuck.I meant the option price per share?BanThis sub needs another purge, been a lotta horseshit gettin tolerated round here latelyThis guy fucksI sell covered calls on my penny stocks.Yeah I did the math. I might have made twice as much had I bought calls instead of shares when TSLA hit $400 in March but I probably wouldn't have bought as much so it would have turned out similarly.Op did buy them at ~750 so if he bought way OTM he would’ve made a hefty profitgnus was fun to watch and play tbhFuck you, I made a whole, uh, $60 off a fuelcell call, penny stocks are the shit.Profit is profit which is better than most.The same thing I do every month. Buy moreYoloBuy the moon

Sell the crashEasiest way to make money on Tesla.I bought like 100 shares last week. I dont really have enough to make a difference lol, not sure I'll even hold much longer.Would you be comfortable buying more now?Tesla IV is always high as fuck, not just around earnings.>Also, doesn't matter what is happening after hours if you have options, can trade them until the market opens.

True, but if you have calls that go ITM you could short shares to lock gains.  If you have poots you can buy shares at a bottom to lock gains.playing earnings with options is the most degenerate thing you can do.Oh honey you don’t know how earnings work do youYou motherfuckers are going to look so stupid when Tesla hits $8000 by EOD tomorrowAlso could be a time traveler.no hes talking about the one that expires in two days, on 7/24, like he said in his original postBoth.

I was in Colorado, hit up a couple of parks but both centers were closed.And in the rain.  And in the sunshine... in any condition, really.I mean, Toyota makes cars for every income bracket above straight up broke, and they’re all reliable and long lasting with even a minimum of care.  They make good cars.  Even when Elon can get the price down on the 3 and Y, they will not last as long as your average Toyota simply because of the battery - which most people won’t bother replacing and will be a huge factor in resale value over the long term.

And let’s not pretend that Toyota can’t be innovative.  The Prius was ahead of its time too.  I’m not shitting on TSLA, by the way.  I think they’re amazing.  But this price is just not justified given where they are and where they’ll be.  I’ll probably short it when I think the pandemic is going to bring things back to some semblance of normal.How much of their revenue is not from automotive?USAA forced everyone to migrate to CS.Haha only 9 shares for me.

That’s my motto anyways but don’t listen to me I am an autist after all.With no stimulus spy would be at 200 right nowI did a little statistical deep dive on the virus in March and realized it would suck, but we’d be OK and recover starting in summer. The thing is the medical/science field and economic field don’t understand each other at all, so it was a great time to buy. I’m up a good 30k and counting on calls made in late March and April.Like I said it was $11,000 for an option of 100 shares>Downvoted for shares. This is a fucking casino. If it’s not options or penny stock yolos, we don’t want to see it.

which penny stocks even have option premium?I volunteer as tribute for Theta.Same.  It's good cash.  You just have to make sure the underlying stock isn't total junk.ShhhhhhYou buying more of TSLA? Damn I’m afraid, but fuck it I would be rich if I wasn’t lol.Goddamn champion, go get ‘emAtta fucking boyNot really. Last I heard Jeremy saying was under $2 is good. Sounds like long term it’s only going to grow. I guess I would be comfortable buying today. I probably will.  But I’m also a dumb ass and someone you shouldn’t take advice from consider I got many shares of Tesla at $1660.It's higher than usual before earnings.   Also, that's why you should look at IV rank and not just IV.Exactly.  I typically sell puts at a price I would be willing to buy the stock at, because ultimately that is would could happen.

Also, I expected a move to the upside which is why I sold more puts than calls.  If the calls go in the money it's still overall profitable.

However, if $TSLA had gone down a lot and puts went ITM I would likely roll down the strike price of the calls and also I would likely sell more calls to neutralize delta.https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/666/080/25a.jpgTheta ganging that shit is how you get rich.What part of stonks only go up do you not understand?I've seen a bunch of earnings after-hours moves completely reverse by morning.

So, I don't - and I'm sure I won't - make enough money to worry, but if I somehow did, I think I could move it to my RRSP (I have something to the tune of $125,000 in available contribution room?) to defer the taxes until retirement.

Pathetic.Lie not detected.yes, this is a wendy's, sir.So is an RRSP. But the amount we put in changes based on income each year.

Contributions reduce taxable income 1:1 and can be carried forward for years.

For example, if I did make $50k from short term buy/sell, my income would be +50k for the year, but I could contribute that (and use it to buy stocks, ETFs or some types of options within the RRSP account) and then offset it with -50k, or spread it out indefinitely depending on what my marginal tax rate is.

We also have TFSAs, which work more like what I thought Roth IRAs did -- each year the amount you can put in goes up by a fixed $ amount, growth within is not taxed, but contributions are already done after-tax. Day trading in there is a no-no.Ah I think IRA is similar but not the same as a TFSA

RRSP is like a 401(k).Came here to say this. Also came.Breaaaaaaastmilk you made my daaaayieyaaaaaayWhat do you think the wife is for? Oh, sorry just noticed your username.

No, wait, AUstralia. HA! Ha. Get it?AtlantisI'm not sure anyone has access to Cambodia at the moment.Once you get a decent chunk of cash silver becomes hard to manage.  It'll fill up even a decent sized safety deposit box really quickly.If we are talking the collapse of America or an apocalypse, no one. 

But if we are talking 2008 or Great Depression crashes there will be plenty of people ready and willing to buy it.Closet safe. It's insured so just dont hurt anyone. and i dont mindI subscribed to a newsletter a while back that researches and makes relationships with the miners. His name is Nick Hodge I think, but there’s a few guys in The Outsiders club. I was down big for the last few years, but now I’m slightly up and gold just keeps going up. If good hits anywhere near $2k, going to be up huge

Revival gold, Midas gold, gold leaf, and at least 4-6 others I’m forgetting.I've got a 2 for 1 Coupon to the OutbackYall got nothing on my original 1984 McRib.I’ll add onto this and make it an extra spicy Popeyes sandwichName checks outNot to judge Cambodians, but how do you know your not getting shafted? Such as a led core or a watered down bar? It doesn’t sound like your going through a registered shopYour first mistake was buying a diamond ring. It's value has been made up since the beginning.I'm not sure if you're serious, but jewelry always appraises for double sometimes triple what you pay.Same thing when I was in the Marines.  Kuwait was always flown through on the way in and out of Iraq.

There were always gold merchants that would sell 24k gold at much less than stateside prices. 

Guys would buy 3-4k in gold chains and sell them as soon as they got stateside. 

I never did it,  but it must have been profitable.And you aren't running arbitrage why?Markup is minor if you're buying ounces. I wouldn't trust Cambodian gold. 0.85 pure!Dude you can import diamond rings.X-ray it to make sure that it doesn't have a cream fillingDo you have an idea of how far below US spot it’s typically available at? Like, cheap enough that it would be potentially worth flying to Cambodia if one was gonna purchase a decent quantity?Oh I see, very clever. It's because they stole it, right?This guy sciencesFair enough I was mostly being hyperbolic for the fun of it.lots will buy if get worsening 70’s style stagflation or 2000’s venezuelan style hyperinflationnice, see you there!You've been losing money on fucking gold?Finally, the sandwich heavy portfolio pays off!I'm here for the McRib!Honestly I don’t. But my wife lived there for 32 years so I leave it to her to know which are scams and which are not.

Edit: I did get some old us coins that ended up being lead or something, not silver. But fortunately I only paid a couple bucks for them. I figured if he was going to counterfeit old coins he would pick ones that were worth more than 0.50 each.The main challenge is getting the gold out. It’s a whole smuggling industry. Typically involves melting and painting it to look like tourist equipment and smuggling it along.Also this happens on a serious level.  China is having issues because up to 4% of its gold it has been using for lending is fake.  

https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.economictimes.com/news/international/world-news/chinas-biggest-gold-fraud-4-of-its-reserves-may-be-fake-report/amp_articleshow/76707339.cmsYou can get a conductivity device if you’re serious about it.  But you can also look at the stamps and see if it has a reputable marks.  Personally I would but jewelry I.e. gold chains in third world countries it’s probably safer than bars. Most are made in a mine in Uzbekistan.   Source: I would in gold miningThat’s where the premium comes in for buying US gold eagles.  Generally speaking you can buy us gold eagles from one of the top vendors for not too crazy over spot.  They’re generally easier to sell off (compared to random bars) and also much more difficult to counterfeit.They wouldn't put (LED) lights in the gold, they would insert tungston rods.

They are totally available from Alibaba premade from china.

Only way to cheaply detect them (short of the destructive melting mentioned before) would be to use an ultrasound scanner -- sound waves move at a different speed through the different materials.

I like sapphires and amethyst more than diamonds personally and they are dirt cheap. 

But my wife loves diamonds -_-Now the question is will they pay that to take it back from you? Because if so I'm about to launch the most profitable company ever.Has to be pyrite and not gold. I don’t get why someone would just take the loss instead of just flying to the US themselves.Dude said sells at spotAlmost always at the exact listing. They will even let you google the price at that moment in some shops. 

I’m honestly not sure how they profit.

Edit if you are white they will attempt to rip you off 100% of the time. I cannot buy it myself, my wife has to do it.No, the commodities miners were in a bad bear market the last couple of years. But have come roaring back with CoronaIf you put a serious percentage of your wealth into gold bullions then I'd suggest:

- gold bullion testing device (XFR based, gold spectrum cannot be faked)
- electric conductivity test device to see it's gold on the inside
- the ancient "ping" test, but this can be replicated with ultrasound devices too

Most of these come in portable variants.I would have thought that’s easy! Smelt it into AA batteries and put them in your camera.[deleted]Ah, so it's FOOLS gold.how can you buy Uzbek product, their potassium is inferior let alone they are very nosey people with bone in their brainHa sorry! I meant lead definitely not LEDYeah sapphires are really cool. I'm not much of a rock guy but I do like to look at opals. 

 Diamonds are only cool in medical equipment haha.I do like the grey/clear diamonds with the cool patterns. Got my wife one of thoseThey were Kuwaiti gold merchants who were allowed to sell on base. 

It was gold. One of my friends was knew a lot about gold for some reason.
Side note,  he could damn near instantly convert grams to ounces.....misspent youth. Anyway, 

  He always loaded up on it and sold it stateside.Doesn’t make sense. I got my gold chain on eBay from a legit jewelry shop at just about the spot value after using one of those ebay cash back coupons that are always on slickdeals.Explanation I got in Qatar was that a lot of times you're paying for barely more than the weight of the gold + no tax and very little for the craftsmanship compared to stateside. Dunno how true that is, because I didn't care to test it.Could just be stolenThey're just like your broker. Except just for gold.Because when people sell it to them they pay less than spot - that's how they profit!ok ily.Sounds like we should invest in gold testing devices.What happens when customs asks you to throw out the batteries or turn on the camera to prove they are realYeah I’m talking about 20-50kg per person, AA batteries are not going to cut itIf you’re transporting a necklace or a watchband worth of gold then you’re not really smuggling anything, you’re just wearing jewelry and you may just have to pay tariffs maybe, if your customs agent is some kind of savant but nobody is going to take you to jail for it. Try bringing 20kg and suddenly things become less trivial.Nice.Well they make a lot of gold chains.  People don’t care where their gold comes from.But you got me thinking. Obviously LED rods would make it very shiny from the inside right?

*Taps head*Diamonds are such a boring fucking stone and it's so aggravating how much artificial worth has been given to them. Oooh look at this bland almost-clear rock that's only redeeming quality is that it can scratch and break other hard shit. So cool. Opal and amethyst are the way to go.You say they are dead and take a big Lnow you've got me thinking about how much space you could reclaim from the actual battery in a battery pack and still have enough to turn the thing on and take a couple of picturesWell that’s a bit more advanced than your average tourist doing some light smuggling once a year. If you are going to spend that much, you have to go the route of paying people off. Or smuggle through an export company. Your not walking through customs with it stuffed in your socksIt's only infuriating if you actually want to buy them. I don't mind that they're expensive because I have no desire to buy any.They have the highest refractive index which gives them the greatest sparkle.
More importantly, it gives the cutter more options - he can cut at greater angles than for other gems: more designs.  In the end they're more attractive.My only thought would be to wrap it around a AAA battery?Would you really have to smuggle it? I mean if you’re doing upwards of 50 Kg/kilo it might just be easier to find a way to legally export it for a sort of "fee".I guess. It's just ridiculous that something is being sold at that drastic of a markup when the labor and supply combined with the demand should make the product insanely cheap.The whole idea of diamonds is just so dumb though. They must've felt so smart selling these shiny rocks to people at such crazy prices.Highest compared to what? Isn't moissanite higher?I suppose so. Regardless, it doesn't even begin to make up for the fact that their naturally high supply (though artifically low actual supply to market) combined with their high demand nets such a huge markup. It's honestly criminal.Most electronics these days don’t use AA batteries, they use lithium battery packs, so what you’d want is a battery pack the same size but only 10% of it is actually batteryThis would work if you isolate the positive and negative sides so that it wouldn’t just warm the gold, then die.That fee would probably make it cost the same if bought direct in your home country I’d imagineYou're right there - I wasn't aware of moissanite.  It seems to me as though it should objectively be a better choice than diamond for jewelry.  I suspect it's just a matter of public awareness and history.
There are some other differences in optical properties that may make it inferior to diamond in practice, like birefringence, but I'm not sure.Fair enough, then again, it’s cambodia. Most countries in that region do have a policy of sliding some dollars across the counter if you want something (not) done. I guess that’s also a form of smuggling, but still.I don’t know if I have the stamina to run up 3 flights of stairs on all fours to bring them to him since I have only been conditioned to handle the single set between my mom’s basement and the kitchen.This is a sign.

The gay name is all I need to know"career"If leo’s thinking they gonna beat, its gonna tank for sure. RIP leo and RIP bag holdersI would 100% use eBay as a broker if I could by options on there.My mail man literally has ASS LOADS of eBay boxes every day. I’ll be getting calls soon.Just do a debit spread lolHopefully MarketWatch sees this and gets a new job for Leo tooWith this level of solid effort, he is above market watch.Flawless logicCan he be in legal trouble for saying that?8/hr * 40hr/wk =$320 gross per week

320 * 40% + 600 means Leo is taking home... enough extra to short TSLA with ODTEDon't worry. Leo is just a code name for Jeff Bezos.I knew AZN was going to crash on Monday when someone here who didn’t understand the difference between share price and market cap said they had callsdouble downThat may have been true years ago, but now with the ease of access to trading I don’t think we will ever have a “professional” equities market ever again. And thank god for that.You don’t think amazon has some sort of AI to sift through all chats?I get this a lot working with Indian call centersOkThat wouldn't really do anything. Just the name "Leo" isn't enough to identify the guy, its the text of the conversation that would enable identifying him. That's true whether the name is censored or not.Just a first name probably isn't enough to identify the guy anyway. If they were gonna find him they'd probably do it by using the content of the conversation.It’s already priced inThat’s just like.. his opinion, man.that actually makes me curious. Obviously in this example its kinda tongue in cheek but where does it cross the line between insider info and just asking a friend who works at a company how business has been goingIt’s been posted on a public forum, not insider anymore 🤪How on earth can they prove a customer success rep has quarterly numbers ... just curiousSEIZE SEIZE SEIZE1 upvote = 1 bear fkI used to sell timeshare at WYND. During our morning sales meetings they would tell us what's budgeted (expected sales) and tell us where we were at for the month for our location (actual sales). They would also tell us "all locations are smashing budget", and shit like that.

I wouldn't consider a sales position a grunt though. Sales are the lifeblood of every company. SDR's and AE's for AMZN AWS platform have the insider information we need to know though.

Leo is a grunt though, and he doesn't know shit, including the evidence that will get him fired is now on social media.LOL you'd be surprised what some of the largest companies are willing to disclose either directly or indirectly to the lowest of members if they're paying attention and catch it.My sources say noCalls on Leo, Benzos sees that he’ll make him a VP😂😂 I'm dying lol.Holy shit7.25p hilariousLmfao!Is he going to get it?

You act on that information? No one gives a shit.Lol. An opinion on a customer service guy. No judge is going to throw leo in jail for that. Well at least if hes white.I bet the sec catches like 1 percent of insider tradingLol....You’re a dipshit if you think that’s gonna trigger an SEC investigation.

edit: meant no disrespect to the workers. sucks if they get endangered. was only focusing on the effect on share pricesI can personally confirm we've done more work during the lockdown in UK than ever before, although it has considerably slowed down since UK started relaxing lockdown rules.OP is only guilty if he traded, and I'm not sure the SEC goes after people trading $58 worth of a fractional AMZN share.Which is most likely why they’ve done itDepends, did you say “can’t go tits up” within the last 30 trading days?he is u/billwatersIt sure beats robinhood investing$1.15/hr might be a good living wage wherever tf Leo is living>These calls are faulty and not as described I want a full refund or I'll leave you bad feedback, and will not be sending them back.Ive been using ebay alot lately because everything on there is cheaper than amazonThey just sold classifieds part of their company for 9 billion dollars.

They track EVERYTHING those agents do.they will gladly assist you with this onethen censor the text and just leave the name...Fair pointIt crosses the line when you make enough money to piss someone offLeo the customer service agent undoubtedly has no access to insider information. He even stated this was his opinion, based on increased online sales. That’s completely public information, the opposite of insider info.I think it's only insider if this dude has access to earnings metrics instead of just giving his opinion. Or if he knew of some new deal or venture on delivery services that had not gone public.I think you have to be a certain level of "rich" for SEC to bother investigating you for insider trading. Martha Stewart? Yes. Joe Schmoe trader with his 5k Robinhood account? Probably not even worth their time>Leo is a grunt though, and he doesn't know shit,

Leo = Dead Punk Bitch100% this

I was interviewing for a position at a company called Americorp and they told me so much about the company

It’s going public in about a year and I’m going all in on it, they make so much fucking money it’s not even funny,

More debt = more profit for themCan confirm... I work in manufacturing, everyone down to the lowest assemblers have all our financials revealed during company wide meetings. I'm not sure why. We're all sworn to secrecy and all have signed NDA's. Honestly it's bizarre. I could be back there making more of the product instead of being harangued for an hour so that the sales department can suck their own dicks in front of the people who actually produce the goods.

Or, worse, winge about how our numbers are down and it's clearly the fault of the production team. Nevermind that materials were late and that we had nothing to assemble.I work at a company everyone knows of and it’s crazy the access I have to data, I’ve never bothered to look through it but if I did I’m sure there would be many insightsMmmm...benzos....Is it because we are retards or reddit stopped hating emojis?I don’t understand :(You son of a bitch>If Amazon bosses see this, Leo is gonna go tits up.

I'm a real retard here. Got tricked twice today.You bitch of a sonBitches son you are.Well done 👏BruhYes, but he is no golden god.Oh fuck that got me

I chuckledClub Amazon?No this is Patricksir this is wendiesSir this is a casino.This is beansThe removal of your SahBabii post shows how bad the mods are of HHH, so much quality OC but let’s listen to bronkhampton againNow the SEC won't let me beCant pay the bills with amazon cards my guyCan i buy calls?Not tendiesAnd womenTbh i would have never thought a csr would have even responded to my question if I had asked! WSB legend in the making especially if the earning are beat.I wish I was SEC so I could get some free insider trades in exchange for not prosecuting the real crooks on Wall Street.This is actually a brilliant idea. Would easily go viral and result in both Bill Walter's and Leo's (but mostly Leo's) fame... and cement Chris Hansen's cult status and take his fame to new levels.Or gets fucked by IV crushYou should delete this comment immediatelyIf HR can't get you for the OP they'll get you for this, actual retard.Do you get to pick your own name or do they pick it for you?

The main impact to EPS is going to come from covid related spending to make FCs safer. Efficiency has plummeted. Inbound inventory shipments typically take a few days at most to get checked in and received, now they are taking weeks. So stuff goes out of stock, it goes backordered, it takes longer to get distributed, ship times increase and sales go down. But I'm predicting a beat on revenue and miss (near zero or slightly negative) EPS.Hey be nice I bought an STT 75.5C 8/21, I know I'm retardedSaying “EZ money” or telling your friends how to trade in the last 30 days can also play a major factor. TRUST MEGambling has negative expected value, being unemployed beats robinhood "investing"Bangladesh, and $1.15/hour would be pretty good there.I dont get how most people dont see this.  I would reckon it's in the 90% or more realm that eBay has the better deal.I used to be a big time eBay seller, mostly wrestling shoes in my day. I quit using it once they started double fisting me with seller fees and PayPal transaction fees. Went rogue and used Flickr because Instagram wasn’t a thing back then lol. 

Still love eBay but am on the buying side nowMost retards don’t care if it’s $2 cheaper on eBay, but it’s a kind of a muscle memory to open the amazon app and just buy it especially when you are a prime member. Actual question: How are the delivery times right now? Still delayed by weeks or is it getting back to 1 or 2 day delivery?You literally can though. I went ahead and looked and a debit spread where you buy a 3140c and sell a 3145c both 7/24 would only set you back 187 dollars


Should you do it? Probably not. But the option existsLong an option

Short an option farther OTM

Your profits are capped at your second strike price, but the option comes cheaper. If you want you could just buy multiple contracts with your saved moneyDamn. I want to short it so bad but I’ve gotten burned going against meme stocks so I probably won’t.

It’s a massive fucking company?They usually do the needful for me.This is the correct answer(( and the way you don’t piss them off is by giving them a cut ))And you dont donate to that someones favorite charity or causeIncreased online sales maybe insider infoThis lol.  People in here don't know what insider trading is.  Unless they are giving cs reps access to financial documents this ain't insider trading.>More debt = more profit for them

The HTZ way, nice work budYeah I was just a mechanic for a extremely large company almost everyone has a product of in their home and we would stright up get told the exact numbers in millions/thousands as to how our revenue and profit was doing. 

The company is private but a lot of the customers aren't and I may have known a particular rental car company was going out of bankrupt since March but didn't buy puts because I'm a dumbass when considering my non corporate or managerial position and fact I wasn't even actually "told" pretty sure I could have legally participated in.Hello daddy.HELLO SECCalls on XANIa whole lot of of column A, a bit of column B7.25 is his current hourly pay and puts on that because he might loose the job 😂I was thinking 7.25 is min wage which but technically if he loses his job his stock drops to zero so that's infinite tendies.

and even if shipping times increase a bit during rona, where else would people take their business? A physical store? LMAOWalmart is better than both100%. I do so much more shopping on eBay even if it's to save a dollar or two. I always shop around to see where I can get the best deal on an item. It's usually not Amazon.This is the kind of shit I need. I’m working with $100 right now and I’m constantly furious I can’t jump into bigger options.Well tempt me with a good time! Done and done! Thx for the idea.RH won’t let me sell calls without either owning 100 shares or having the capital to back it up. Is this a RH only feature?Wouldn’t Leo actually have to have info on the company? Couldn’t amazon or Leo argue it’s a joke 


That being said I had to take a job at Home Depot recently and will likely have to go back when another shut down happens and I was surprised about how much info they gave every day associates like myself. Sales numbers and goals to hit...As long as they revert back to let you know hence.Or re-election campaignWould be a stretch, but I suppose it could be argued. But honestly if the SEC pursued him in any way, that would be a ridiculous case to prosecute. I would represent Leo pro bono if necessary haBest to err on the side of caution when it comes to insider trading.

Probably you'd have been fine as there would have been a lot of dots to connect to link you to small fry trades, and the info you had was probably not on paper, but still. If you could have made trades worth your while, then they'd be big enough to garner scrutiny.$7.25 is the minimum wageDo they really make only that much per hour wtf?you have no idea how puts work and I love itNever forget oil going negativeOhhhhh I didn’t realize that people on here know enough about astrology to make inside jokes about specific dates.

Proceeds to lose 5k on TSLA FDs

Gotta love WSBSelling uncovered calls has undefined risk so pretty much no one lets you do it unless you're really experienced and have a lot of margin. You need to select both the short and long call at the same time. To do this just long press the option and it turns into a checklist kind ofI got AIDS from these commentsRe election campaigns are for buying politicians. You buy the press and courts via charitiesputs are when stonk go down more stonk go down the puttier it isI won’t son, I won’t.shit now i gotta start trading my zodiac, fuckPeople in WSB come from all walks of life and backgrounds. It's the only place dems and repubs get along for the sole purpose of getting tendies.  You can be gay or as fat as a cow and nobody cares!Trading zodiac is the titsactually wow that is minimum wage lmao I didn't even connect thatIt’s 15$ where I live, so yeah you could say I’m pretty richI guess I’m showing my privilege by the fact that I didn’t even know that was minimum wage lmaoNo way! That kind Indian gentleman contacted me recently about an inheritance from his father the deposed king! Also, I think he was Nigerian.The nice Indian gentleman called me too, but instead of giving him amazon gift cards, I called the FBI and had him SWATed—whoops.Only thing raining is tears out my eyes bruhFfs, my account was level 2 options and I had to manually upgrade it to level 3. If I knew this earlier I could have saved so much loss, or I would have lost more, who knows in this market.Amazon minimum wage is $15/hrOMG bro do you not know which way stonks gousername check outCan I be a gay bear? Asking for a friendAnd it's 3 days from now which means he was saying he'll be fired immediately.eh i mean thats the federal minimum wage, most places dont use it as they have state and local minimum wagesWow that’s crazy! This Indian man is a scholar and a gentleman. He recently contacted me about my car warranty being expired for my 2004 Toyota mustang. He had me give him credit card numbers (I lost all my money in my bank so I gave him 2 $500 prepaid cards). He’s really a stand up guy if you ask me.Probably save lol, credit spreads vs just shorting one leg is a bit more iffy, but if all you've done up to this point is buy options, imo at least, debit spreads are much better because you can make much more on much lower movement with the same risk (or if you prefer, just make less on less movement with less risk)Leo will be an "exceptional" employeeEven their 3rd world  customer service employees?HahahaPolice officer here, I got called to a possible fraud complaint where the same indian dude scammed a nice old couple. Turns out it was not a scam and he looked me up and found out that I had an outstanding IRS bill for 15K too. But all good now I paid him with the Amazon gift cards. Wow, I am sure gald I am a police officer, saved me from IRS problems!I definitely understand them from a fundamental point of view. By that I mean I watch a lot of YouTube.
I just thought they were a privilege enjoyed only by the rich.I guess maybe not those guys, but sure. They have some employees that work for contractors. This guy looks like he is somewhere along those lines because of the acute accent above the sThe guy must be Canadian.Imagine how embarrassing it would be if you had to arrest yourself, and then if you resisted it would be a felony.Most brokers require you to have (some not alot) of margin to use spreads. No idea why RH is the exception

RH allows anything with defined risk I think if you can put up the collateraldo you know how execution of spreads work?

for example, i have uvxy call debit spreads. 26/32. expiring august. 

let’s say vix pops to 33 this week. will the spread automatically be worth the max amount? if not, is there a way i can exercise to get the max profit?Usually people will just try to close out a spread early instead of executing. As for if you can execute certain legs but not others, no idea as I've never tried that before. If I was to guess though I doubt they would let you just execute the long leg of a spread and keep the short leg because that could just turn into a naked call which as discussed, is really fucking dangerousyeah. Problem is, from my experience, spreads are not worth their max amount before expiration. If you don't believe me, try making a completely ITM spread, for example, UVXY 25/26 debit call spread. It's worth like 75 instead of the 100 max value--which kinda makes sense, given that it can still go down before expiration. idkI usually either let my spreads expire or I sell early for a profit so I can free up capital. I don't really mind whether or not they hit max value earlyI gotcha. Good luck with your trades!Someone on here bought this truck but they’ll never admit it.I live in SLC, utah and ive seen that truck before... maybe its meThe retail bubble is real when you just randomly see a license plate like this lmaoNo truck nuts in addition to the plates.

Reminds me of when Rockefeller (Vanderbilt?) was getting stock tips from a kid shining his shoes - only to then remove everything from the market in the late 1920si think he just either misspelled tiddies or really likes chicken tenders. 

there is no limit. just dips to buy!Probably has nothing to do with stonks. He just saved up enough good-boy points to get his mom to buy him an F150.Don’t worry too much, he couldn’t even get a high trim level. Makes me wonder how much deserves that plate. it's not really a bubble is it

besides, compared to 1999 we're just fine, on any level, including PE ratios etc

Also, how did you connect the story you mentioned with vehicle depreciation?LOL.  Fucking city folks.  

Yes your base Corolla was an excellent financial decision.What vehicle doesn’t depreciate?You are wrong about truck values.That was a smug bullshit story to soothe the plebs. Dude big dicked the country by shorting the market with insider knowledge, tried to fund a coup with the winnings to preserve his constitutional right to tendies, and set his sons up for careers in politics for 6 decades.Trucks are shit unless it's a Tacoma or old Ford RangerWhy not just invest in things the retail investors find boring?I can't tell if troll or top tier meme I'm too normie to understand.What? I thought this was America?And yet I still see them everywhereJust ordered my TSLA3000 plate last week!Oh I don’t go outside enough to find things like thisCallS.

Actually is the most perfect reply. 100%

Everyone else...twisted truck nutsSounds like a true statement of a mark ;)
what could possibly go wrong?Holding value doesn't matter when you're paying 30% interest for $100/wk for 15 years"Robinhood's gonna own it all eventually anwyay!"That's true they do. Mostly this post has been an exercise in "bad joke" or "jokes that don't go well" or "know your audience" (clearly the line of WSB is trucks...which I find interesting)

In truth...I just hate modern trucks. They're stupidNgl corollas are great30years rural living.
Last car was a Toyota compact, clocked out at 310k miles (all maintenance and repair myself).
Hauled more feed and essential than most could. Never got stuck in the snow.

But please...assume you know me.
Balls get twisted so easily for truck folks.Collectible ones.Very true. Cost of ownership is $8000 a year according to AAATacomas and 4Runners depreciate VERY slowly.Ford Raptor, you should watch the doug demuro video on youtubeFor whatever reason, Jeep Wranglers maintain their value pretty nicely. They depreciate some, but even a 20+ year old Wrangler with a few aftermarket parts still sell for like 20-30k, even with 100k miles or more. I guess it's because people like to pretend to use giant lifted Jeeps with winched and shit. Same thing with Teslas.

Meanwhile if you buy practically any other car, you immediately lose 30% as soon as you leave the dealership, which is why I almost always just buy used cars.Well on the slower than average side... Toyota suv and trucks, Honda suv, jeep wranglers, diesel 3/4 and 1 ton trucksCarrera GTSure. Whatever. Anyone that wants to dump an amount of a truck vs a real WSB...is fine.It was top tier.  Literally the best there ever was.  I’d stake my SPY 8/21 200 p on it.Exactly. It probably offended someone :/

Probably the autists that bought Ford Calls instead.What’s your positionUnderstandable. I was starting to have an identity crisis I’m glad we were able to clear that upYesYea I think the tailgate was slightly bent outwards, maybe spreading the lights more.That's why I rotate out: T Bell, Arby's and Bob Evans.Thanks for the adviceDo what you love and you'll never work a day in your life.But/r/investing says you need to have multiple income streams. That's why I only do gangbangs.Honestly never heard it put better.Wise words. This will make it into the history books one day.He's in Utah. He just wants a few more pallets of beans, rice and grains to put in his pantry.No need.   He prints those too.   BrrrrrWhat's not cool? Pretty tame comment tbhThe real WSB move is buying one of these which is burning by the side of the road for $50 and hoping it rains.That is not how auto loans work at all. It's hard to find a loan longer than 5 years max and most interest rates are less than five percent. The exception is the stories of those guys who joined the military, got their first paycheck, and decode to go buy their first new car, a road queen truck or a mustang, from the sketchy dealer just off base and finances through them.I just want a god damn Ford Ranger, even the Chevy Colorado is too big.  I want a truck that I can move shit occasionally but that's also small enough it says on it's own: "No, fuck you, not helping you move."That's why I got a 2019 Tacoma with a 2TR four cylinder motor. New body, same engine for the last 30 God damn years.The apocalyptic cockroach.

Though the Corolla my wife got years ago during grad school had a cracked spark plugs and leaking ball bearings. A very un-Corolla Corolla.How many tons of feed could you fit in that compact lolToyota compact.  Base Corolla.  I got pretty damn close.  You weren’t hauling a lot of feed in a Corolla. A bag of rabbit food once a month?  Or maybe it was chicken feed for your three chickens.[deleted]According to lorsdstownmotors.comprob TSLA 7/24 3000 if i was at gunpoint and you forced me to guessThrow in an olive garden so you can get some free bread between handy's and you are good to goOh true, you diversified.

Also...I had no idea mentioning a truck would cause so much discourse :)Yeah im talking about the people who finance through sketchy dealers.  Its crazy what you can get through them here in the deep south where even Ford dealers hand out sketchy loansLove that pickup truckOwn a Toyota 4Runner same engine  by 4.0 from the 2002 model even in the 2020 model.Best F'ing motor around. I've torn a few apart.

Work of beauty.My last one was 11 years old and had 170,000 miles on it. Ran just fine. I ended up getting a 2020 and I love itI tell you hwhat.

Nothing beats my rear wheel truck (with almost no weight) to haul my propane and propane accessories.


You're astounding and accurate observations have made me see the light.
Thank-you Fist. Thank-you, for your understanding and infinite patience and understanding.It happens. This is enough DD for now.

 The response regarding trucks has made most folks think they're all Rockridge thinking they're a chicken that got caught in a tractor's nutsI made money selling my last truck and got into a fun Tacoma after that. Nobody expects vehicles to not depreciate but trucks can get pretty close if you buy them right.Drove through Utah a couple times probably correctYes Mr PresidentSo.....everyone?Company?Wait for real? I’m looking at buying a Tacoma right now and thought the 6 cylinder was the way to go...I'm hoping to get at least 500,000 miles on itwife also has a 2020 corolla and loves it, very slick, minimal interior quite peppy too.Ok Propane Hank

https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/008/040/latest.jpgThat's a level of DD I'm not prepared to share.

Mostly cuz I never bother to do any.You'll get just as many miles on the 6 cylinder but the 4 banger is far superior just doesn't feel like enough in the 3rd gens. If I was getting a 1st or 2nd Gen I would seek out the 4 bangerYepIf you ever read some DD that says the market is going to crash, or you are looking at buying puts, just watch this video until you stop yourself. There is no way you are going to beat somebody entering numbers into their own bank account


Strap in. Shoot your insulin. This ride only goes up. Only way down is deathNO NONSENSE POWELLI know he means actual dollar backed securities but I can’t help but imagine a cookie clicker type game to print money digitallyImagine needing degrees from the most elite institutions in the world, with experience at the most prestigious firms to just PRINT MONEY. 

Truly amazingReal nice economy you have here....Playing monopoly and getting to be both player and bankI just realized I've never actually heard jpow's voice until now. I always thought he would sound like an old man.Basically JPow is playing this game https://thefed.app/applyThe federal reserve quiet period ends on July 28th. Make sure you exit out of your positions by the end of the day on the 27th. We are screwed and I have a feeling a true 0% interest rate is coming, followed by deflation in December as people sell out their stock.And I am working ass off day and night for this digital moneyJPow: its Fiat Central Banking , read about it motherfuckers."how do you print currency digitally?"

"We just increase the size of the account"It also dilutes the value of the dollar in your pocket,

Theft by stealth, no need to take money from your account, or increase taxes.It is a little more complicated now because 83% of US bond reserves are in ETFs. Remember, buying or selling a Bond cost brokerage so traders are happy to phone their customers and convince them to switch. But with ETF, there is no intermediary since it is secondary market, so the government now need to pay people to create an artificial market in order for investors to be able to sell them and buy stock.

Pretty fucked up.it's "borrowing" from the futureThroughout history, any country that allows private entities to print money out thin air will fall due to its mismanagement of such great power.

The purpose of money is to facilitate economic transaction within a society, not build bubbles of debt and print money to fill the void after the bubble bursts. Bubbles also create wealth gaps since the wealthy are usually the ones that are safe while the commoners are less fit to navigate harsh downturns causes by bubbles.DON’T YOU KNOW JPOW MONEY PRINTER GO BRRR BITCH[deleted]This is the interview of the year"Where does it come from when you just print it?"

...Yes.Placing bets if JPow is going to cause hyperinflation.

It’s a down a little with a few exchanges, but I expected something more severe.Honestly I just read "The Deficit Myth" and it gave me the push I needed to understand MMT.

The author had an agenda in writing the book, I don't agree with all the programs she proposes.

But fiat currency derives its value from the government's ability to prevent counterfeiting and tax commerce denominated in that currency.

The U.S. is the most monetarily sovereign nation in the world. We borrow in our own currency which we have the power to issue.

The national debt never has to be paid back. We owe like half of it to ourselves anyway. The Treasury and the Federal Reserve could decide tomorrow to replace every single treasury bill and bond with its face value in dollars and it would mean nothing. Treasury bonds are just interest-bearing dollars. You have $1,000 now or the promise of $1,000 and some interesting while you wait.

Our economy grows because we add money to it. And our ability to issue currency means we can literally never run out.u/vredditdownloaderThe ultimate cheat codeI loop this on playback at night while I sleep knowing my SPY calls are hard at work under Jeromes watchful whispering eyes.BRRRRRRRRRBut they dont mint any coins, that's why theres a coin shortage.

And its only shown we have strong monetary policy and weak fiscal policy here. But you’re on this blog to make money, right? So stop with the tunnel vision and look across the pond or to Zhongguo. $750 euro package and the people’s republic of China is pumping their hell out of their markets. It’s an election year and there’s whispers of another stimulus, permanent UBI and even tax credits for just taking a trip. And it’s only July. Not to mention the dollar is going to be devalued/no longer reserve currency and since that was happening with or without coronavirus why not print a ton of money to pay off our US debts or for key partners to pay off theirs so they don’t have borrow from China. One guy just posted a whole bunch of stats about banks and healthcare. Screw banks. LONG $SQ $LVGO $TSLA $TDOC is all I’m going to say and I hope he is to knowing how shitty the financial industry in the US. This bull market is only beginning. And is domestic policy will push it higher in the end. Happy trading!End the FEDLaughs in ArgentinaWtf Jerome has a CHAD fucking voice. I bet hes got a piece on him too.That's the whole idea

Entire reason he talks about it so matter-of-factly, in-your-facely, is to tell the bears to back off and let the market know the fed's in charge of this market, meaning it won't crash just like that. For a crash to happen it has to be the fed's doing or the fed will go down with it, in which case the entire world economy's basically over, doesn't matter how many dollars you have in that case

So "dance with me and we'll ride this out together" is what he's sayingThere are currently 10 yr and 5 year bonds being put on the market. I think it’s 40b yesterday, 40b today, 20b Wednesday and 20b on Thursday. The market is gonna blow. Don’t be surprised by 5-10% gains in different stocks prior to their earnings release. If they gain 20% in 3 days prior to their eps, what is a 10% loss after earnings release?     

For perspective: the EU approved a 750B bailout, and people are suddenly bullish on European stock. The bond sales equate to 17% of what the EU is giving to all of their members, except the 120b usd is going straight into the stock market. Those new bonds will be a delicious day trade, as will spy calls, qqq calls, tqqq calls, and travel calls. Don’t be surprised if Tesla beats eps expectations. Remember Luckin Coffee? Elon has enough money to pay someone else to take the blame for accounting mistakes.I went rogue for one week and bought puts lost shit ton..bought calls last Friday feelin like a genius again 
In J Powell we trust-The Japanese have been doing this sinds the 90's, and look where it has taken them.Here's my bullet proof theory: The market did crash, but the PRICE of the stock market went up proportionately to the expected inflation added.You cannot create money out of thin air without consequence. This will come back at us eventually.Maybe a dumb question, but what is a DD?

Edit: guess I was asking for dumb answers LOLThe only thing to bring this Con down is if people stop spending on anythingHang on boys we’re riding this thing all the way up or until the wheels fall off.Until it doesn’tOnly inflation but us currency closest thing to goldDon't buy puts? Tell that to /r/wallstreetbetsSpoken like broccoli man... - Buy the dip you fucking idiot.I confidently unloaded TQQQ when it got back up to 91Fed easing has no effect on market when market is risk averse. Fed can brr all it likes market still eventually crashes.You're right. But there will come a time when the dollar will cease to exist and will become worthless because of this act.You mean the countries bank accountI learned this right after the first bump, when I bought puts and was promptly scolded into poverty. JPow is a kind god, though. He found it in his heart to gift me a raise and fire me from my job, so that I may praise the printer, in his glorious name, as my full-time position. Blessed is he that rebukes the bears, for his place in the kingdom of capital is as absolute as the great bull. May the printer never overheat, and may we never know the value of our sacred currency. JPow be praised. Amen.So can someone explain and fill in the details about where the money ultimately comes from? 

They buy up treasuries and bonds...by digitally creating money out of thin air to bid in those auctions. So then there are fewer treasuries and bonds, which drives prices of other things up.

But ultimately those treasuries and bonds have to pay their coupons, which are funded by...the U.S. tax payer, right? But the Fed holds the bonds, so the interest gets paid to them...? Then what?The Fed injecting money like cum into your hot mom's ass.  0% interest rates starting a stock market gang bang.  And we've finally reached an internet/information proliferation tipping point that is unifying the world's retards into stock market speculators.  Seriously, so many young Asians and Europeans are pouring money into American tech stocks.  South Koreans are buying the shit out of Tesla.Thanks, just bought 2000 put contracts to inverse you lolits like eating your own shit for a meal, how long till it kills youI mean what happens if 🌈 🐻 just stop bearing?

#**BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR**Buy silver. Or better yet load up pasta. It's our future currencyWhich means that assets of the same value now all have a higher price.  See?  They only go up.You are correct in the theoretical sense.

However the economy is currently contracting fast enough to offset it.

If we were doing this during a time of economic growth, you'd be correct.Dude people have been spouting this since 2009 when QE started and inflation is still under 2%. Stop with the doom and gloomBoy, this sub got front page level of stupid in the last 3 monthsNo it doesn’t. The contracting economy counters it. If they would have been doing this, say a year ago, then yeah you would have been correct.It doesnt. The value of the dollar is only getting stronger internationally. Wage stagnation is killing your dollar moreYeah the government doesn’t have money. So when they print this money they are either getting it from taxing us (which they aren’t) or inflation.Holy shit I have a crazy idea so you can be safe from this.

So the federal reserve isn't printing money to pay for past debt it owes, its printing money to buy others debts like an investment in a way. There are similar consequences to this as there would be with printing money to afford payments on debt but we wont see the consequences for years and thats only if we mismanage the federal reserves net debt schedule.i'm sure all those robinhood traders will be fine in a harsh downturn. Haven't you heard they are better then Warren Buffet at this ?Except we have a global economy now that is intrinsically linked to each other on many many levels and the realization that growth cannot and should not stop.

It isn't like it used to be.Except for every country in the developed world?The fed isn’t a private entity though?It’s not building a bubble of debt though. The cost of debt is so cheap that we’re paying the same for interest as we did decades ago.Fed is not a private entity in that sense. This is like high school grade conspiratorial bullshit.If you don’t understand the difference between rigging the economy and managing it... then what are you even doing here?60 minutes is a fucking joke.

More like my extra chromosome is acting upIt works until it doesn’tof course its real... why is this scary?

So just because it sounds scary to you doesn't mean it's objectively scary.Reddit go brrrrrBig timeThe US dollar is considered a safe haven in uncertain times by many non-US companies, therefore this creates demand, offsetting the dilution in value. Also, it's the world's reserve currency. If you are American, you can thank your smart great grandpas for the [Bretton Woods Agreement](https://www.thebalance.com/bretton-woods-system-and-1944-agreement-3306133) and later to Nixon changing the rules partially, making the whole world pegging their currencies to the USD. 

So when you buy SPY puts you are fighting the FED, IMF, Nixon and your great grandpas.Oil is priced and sold in USD. We are still #1 economy and we are considered stable. If any or all change, 🤷‍♂️That can work. What happens when oil is no longer in demand?
What happens when the USA economy is passed by China?
What happens when political destabilization in the USA degrades foreign confidence in the USD?🤦‍♂️ do you live under a rock?Took you 4 months to realize that huh buddy?

One of us.Yes, sonHis eyes kind of look downcast at the floor as he says, "Yes, we did, that's another way to think about it.  We did," when asked if the printer is actually going "brrr."

The interviewing is going, "Say it ain't so, Joe," and Jerome is going, "Yes, kid, I'm afraid it is."

Like...yeah, it's all a sham - nothin' we can do about it now.I’ll dance with you Papa JPowHe said it like that so he doesn’t look like a buffoon who’s trying to downplay it by giving some convoluted answer.Yeah, I think he's arguing that his view is rational and that while it may screw up bears, that's not his priority.The world economy obviously wouldn't collapse if the market crashed. Even the Great Depression failed to do that.This is why I have thousands of rounds of ammunition. That will be the currency when the world falls to shit.So tsla eow 3000? 😎So basically the government prints then lend money to big funds then big funds buy stonks. So fed money go to stonks?How to position for the crash?>10 yr and 5 year bonds being put on the market.

How do you know when they are being put on the market?You sure about that sale yesterday? Like really really sure?How has theory worked out ?So much money being printed and no where else for it to go.  The stock market party will keep going until there is real pain in the economy, not just predicted pain.  So until we see all the actual evictions and defaults and bread lines nothing changes.  And heck the market might even keep deluding itself by saying yeah but when that vaccine comes it will fix all this and bam we're right back to pre-pandemic earnings.  Vaginal shaped recovery.I've done half assed searches for the bonds being created, but I don't have the greatest knowledge in this area.  Could you give me a website where you get this information?  I would love to add this to my DD toolbox.I lost about 5% on snap today, what do you think the move is. Sell at the bell or holdNot true. It was not 750 million approved. It is like 400 million.

WHere you see millions, read billions. 400 bn are 0 interest. the rest are loansI did opposite on Friday. I need some F.Deflation is like a psychological disease. Thankfully Americans are too dumb to hold out on their impulsive purchases.Yeah but they've also had other issues like a shrinking population and huge losses in trade to china since then, so id imagine that also plays a roll in there mess of an economy.

Edit: PlaYS a RolE iN ThEYre* their that better?The primary difference is Japan is filled with people that save and invest wisely. WSB is why America is going out the top. Once the FED realizes how easy this was they will never let is go down again.Fill me in hereObviously their penis shrinkJapan is rich in terms of assets and foreign holdings. They print Yen to invest globally and in the US Treasury, so they can build up their saving and keep Yen low for competitive export. The US allows this because Japan is a geopolitical ally and allow big US base on their islands.Yep central banks aren’t putting money in average idiots pockets who spend it which would be the only way to make real inflation, that’s why the printer hypothesis is retarded, velocity of money is still horrible so assets will eventually follow it downYou aren't wrong. The fed forcing bond rates down, the only good option to avoid getting inflation boned is buying stonks.  Once interest rates rise and the fed decides it can't keep buying garbage bonds to keep yields well below the fair market value, the market will correct.Mind blownThat just fucked me up.It would if there wasn't such a ridiculous demand for dollars abroad. The dollar is the reserve currency of the world and there is plenty of demand to soak up the money printer going Brrr.If you can't do that then we're totally fucked because that is literally the central pillar of the monetary system of the modern world.You can if you have the biggest military in the world.Dragon DildoDerp DiveDing dongDouble DoucheDick DockingDouble DDue diligenceDunkin' DonutsDonald DuckDue diligenceDerrick DickThe biggest.one large titCup size for a brassiereThat was a good 5 mins well spentI read this and could instantly hear the noise and smell the tape.

You can kick it down the road as much as you want, some**one** has to make you stop, and when they try you just declare warDude... This ship has sailed. NO ONE is paying off this debt. MMT is the new economic model whether we like it or not. It doesn't have to make sense, as we will all find a way to make it work because it's literally the only option we have.What our national debt at? 27 trillion or some shit? I say we just print 27 trillion dollars and get ourselves out of debt. Who gives a shit. Republicans want to lower the minimum wage anyway. Here’s your chance without any legislation whatsoever.Government debt is just assets for the private sector. That’s where our money comes from. 

A fiat government will also never default on its debts. The sole issuer of USD will not default in the currency that it creates.Passing that one to Gen-A.  10 or 15 years from now they can deal with the REAL fallout.As long as inflation is low, the size of the debt isn't a huge deal.the national debt literally does not matterIt won't be hard to build back better considering the state of how things are being left to us.

Buying it early will make you lose money or have less profits. What is a 10% loss to a stock if it gains 5%+8%+4%? You’d still lose 7% and with options that is a 100% loss. Check the IV cause you don’t want to buy a high IV stock with shit expectations.I wouldn’t normally say a major drop, but Jim Cramer is wrong more often than he is right and he said, “I don’t think a 40% drop in 1 day will happen.” I didn’t think it was possible until he said something.

|-|-|-|-|Easy there Ms. Rand, what do you suppose we do go back to a good standard?They will be forced to because we have one of the biggest and best armies in the world so if they don't we will just blow them up. That forces their trustWhen the fed buys bonds with invented money, do they get paid back when the bonds mature, and keep all the money?I bought silver producer stocks 3 weeks ago up 61% with the push above $20, my stocks increased 20% yesterday small moves in the silver price are multiplied in the stocks,

========> Today the 21st of July 2020 is also up about 17% for Endeavour Silver corp, at close of the markets when silver spot price moved up about $1.35, so some nice leverage, it can't always go up some days it will trade sideways, consolidate, and could move up or down, if you want volatility, silver producers are the quickest way to make some nice gains, small cap mining stocks will move later and move up more, if you can find a good junior stock, and be able to buy shares, some small cap stocks are not easy to find,

Silver above $20 is a really good sign it is a start of a nice run, when the news start reporting silver there will be FOMO,

Gold loves inflation / deflation / money printing and market panic,

Gold / Silver ratio set to drop biggly,

Comex hopefully should fail allowing the banks who have manipulated gold and silver for 20 years to not be able to deliver physical metal when asked,

Rumours are 500 to 1 paper ounces of silver to physical metal,

I am excited for a run up on silver still could move down so holding cash to buy the dip,

If it doesn't go mental in this climate it never will.Ice is the currency of the future broCan you explain this like I'm a wsb user?I agree that right now it's offset by the economic contraction, but what happens in 5 years if we are back to normal growth - don't we end up with a ton of extra cash in the system leftover from 2020 that causes inflation?If the money supply increases AND the GDP shrinks, it means you have more money to buy less stuff.

This absolutely devalues the dollar in your pocket, theoretically and very practically.It’s still accounted for and sitting on a balance sheet. It’s the worst use (productivity wise) you could ever dream of.Shh. Somebody has to be on the other side of my TQQQ calls.All the extra money is getting pumped into the stock market. That's why stonks keep going up despite an overall worsening economy. CPI isn't equipped to reflect this.Turns out MMT might be right and all finance bros are in a corner rocking back and forth on the edge of insanityHuh? Against what metric? 

USD index has plummeted from ~103 to 95. 

Gold about to bust up to 2k. 
Silver up over 7 percent in one session.
Palladium and platinum also posting around 5% gains for the session.
AUD way stronger since pre COVID meltdown. 

These things do not happen when there’s confidence in the economy and the USD.>	If we mismanage 

We’re fucked> its printing money to buy others debts like an investment in a way

The Fed is becoming the bagholder for Wallst. Let the public take the loss.Like holy shit you don't get it. The banks loan money that people can't pay back, so the feds print money to keep them solvent. The feds aren't "buying debt." Common people still have the same amount of debt they did before. The banks are just making bad investments like everyone else and don't have any consequences. Just keep lending the same as they always do.>thats only if we mismanage the federal reserves net debt schedule.

kinda like more than doubling the liabilities on their balance sheet in a span of... uh.. 3 weeks?"We" aren't printing money to buy debt, the fed is printing money to loan to us so we have more debt.  The fed doesn't buy "others debts", it buys our debt so that we owe them money, so that our government owes them money but today can afford to pay it's debts.  Your post makes it sound like the US gov and the Fed share a bank account, which they do not.  The US gov is borrowing money from the fed to pay its past debts, which you will have to pay back through taxes.Yes it is. Look it up bro. It’s not a public service entity like our government. We handed over the power to print to a bunch of bankers.

Could you imagine if your great great grandfather was one of those few men who brokered that deal with the US government? They’re beyond wealthy. 

They make money by lending money to the government and banks for interest. Since they could just print money, it’s literally free money. 

Their best interest is to keep the dollar worth something but make a lot of money on interest. What better way to do that than get people to be in debt? It’s financial slavery. Our government owes them a lot of interest.People have no idea what they’re talking about when it comes to basic monetary policy. Even on r/finance or r/economicsSame thing as everyone elseIf you find out let me know.People underestimate the power of the sound old modem that connected to your phone line makes. Now it is moving your mortgage and the stock market.I’m not being greedy with it. I’m basically selling puts for the stocks I want at prices I day dream about how I wish I had gotten them so cheap. Worst case buy shares of a company that I love at super low prices. Deep down I almost hope the market tanks and I “have to” buy up cheap stocks to fulfill the puts I sold.Im saying the deepfake technology is scary! As much so as the FED sarcastically saying yeah bruh we flooded flooded flooded flooded
Bust down my neck, this shit custom, print out!
I bust down your bitch with my govementGood questions. As many know already, oil is always transacted in dollars irrespective of the origin or destination. "Petrodollars." I suppose the effect of the loss of oil as a commodity is unclear but I doubt it would be highly destructive to the power/value of the dollar.

China's central bank has to buy a lot of foreign currency to maintain a certain valuation for its own currency. However the yuan is definitely gaining ground as a global currency (it's already a reserve currency). US economy is still large and even if passed by China would still have more than enough goods and services to sustain our current level of monetary sovereignty.

Political destabilization degrading foreign confidence in the USD is basically a moot point. Treasurys are sold to Federal Reserve, insurance companies, etc. Even if we have to pay more interest, remember, we issue the currency and pay it in our own currency. We're not talking about a nation like Colombia or Brazil selling dollar-denominated debt. If you ever see the U.S. selling euro-or yuan-denominated debt, you'll know we're in trouble.RightImplying giving convoluted answers like a buffoon isn’t commonplace. This moment’s a rare moment of truth from him, thus it went viral. There’s a reason for it. You don’t say ”yes, we print money out of our asses, what you gonna do?” as fed chair unless the situation requires itThe world economy didn’t rely on the USD and the USD wasn’t leveraged up to the neck, there wasn’t a federal reserve managing the world’s reserve currency at that time. If the world’s reserve currency goes belly-up you can kiss the economy as we know it right now good bye.The Great Depression didn’t have a clear world power and clear challenger and also the interconnectedness that the modern economy does.NahIdk. Do the math on how high Tesla has to go in order for Elon to hit his next bonus. I’d bet money he is going to hit his next bonus.Check that, tsla 999999 by end of day.BrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrI’m on Tesla calls atm, gonna sell out and roll both ways at close. At $80 difference I should be able to roll itm if the stock goes either way. Add into volatility and you’ve got alpha.Inflation adjusted.. yes.Pulls cord on Speak and Spell, ‘...the farmers fed goes brrrrrrr’fed prints money buys shitty bonds so big funds can't buy shitty bonds and thus have to buy stockJust don’t forget tech/health and travel/leisure are inverse atm. They may both gain, but their gains almost have an ebb and flow effect as if the government is trying to prop a minimum stock price and a maximum stock price. Makes sense since trade volumes are down 40%, and the market follows federal monetary stimulus quite accurately. Watch for when 10 yr bonds diverge from the direction of the indexes(excluding russel, an attorney I know said russel stocks are fucked, but I can’t invest cause it’s ii).Tlt calls exp sept and another set for March. Try to stick otm but as close as you can afford. I’d expect it to go to $200, but anything below $180 will be alpha.

You analyzed more than the surface reasons for why something might have happened and in your explanation you managed to use the wrong role and their.I'm not saying the US is there yet, but the average number of children per household has fallen below 2 in the US, which if left in a isolated bubble would mean population loss. However, immigration has made up for that, but the country seems to be leaning anti-immigration for the last 4 years, so who knows what will happen over the next decade.You still fucked up its theirLol the edit is even more wrong. High odds to reliably always chose the wrong their/they’re/there.Not to mention a nation's economy is dependent on their diplomatic standing as well. Japan can't walk into JPow's office and demand that we strengthen the dollar. We do that all the time. 

There's little difference between what we're doing and what Japan did in the late 80s and early 90s. The difference is, we run this shit, and thus we have ways of manipulating currency in order to keep things in our favor.> PlaYS a RolE iN ThEYre

You know it's just as retarded without the alternating caps?But are we assuming that they just figured out how to solve an economy? I wish it were that simple but if it was this obvious wouldn't someone have figured it out a long time agoHow do they invest wisely if their index can't perform like ours? 

It's a Catch-22. Surely they have to pay tariffs if they want to own American equities.just cocaine and hookers all the way down.No problem, bend overIt has to correct. We just ejected the market with 10 trillion, i don't get how more people are not worried about this.The FED is actively making the case against the dollar being a reserve currency.Valuation through exchanging of money is not the same as printing money out of thin air.Pretty much this. The fed and gov can and will do anything they want if nobody can stop themThe work of a true artist.I had too much fun on that.Amen brother let’s cum in their cornflakesScrew that. The federal reserve should hit the circuit breakers like only they can, and then sell all of their shares before anyone can sell out of the market. Crash it at a profit and let the market restart.You sure? We could just pass it off to Gen Z?Can't blame us; Boomers started it.Yup, we can call it their inheritanceAll in favor?Now wait a minuteYep, when we went off the gold standard we went onto the Too Many Aircraft Carriers, Subs, and ICBM to Give a Fuck StandardThat printing is debt if I understand correctly. The government has to pay the fed back for all the money that was printed so you can't really pay back debt by printing more debt.

I could be wrongWe don’t have to default to get to a crippling level of debt interest that shuts down most government spending, this doesn’t just go away, it’s gonna be a shitshowI enjoyed that the picture for "insurance fraud" is the twin towersAny chance he says that the effects of the pandemic have not been as bad as they thought?If you’re going TQQQ, why not UPRO?Remindme! 4 weeksLol.

Sometimes the wagon doesnt move because the wind is blowing hard on him from both sides.No offense but this is basic level macroeconomics> don't we end up with a ton of extra cash in the system leftover from 2020 that causes inflation?

no because where there was contraction in the economy, money was removed from the system.   most currency exists digitally, we don't print actual physical currency for every dollar in the economy.The Fed can also remove currency from circulation if they think they need to...>  it means you have more money to buy less stuff.

we have plenty of "stuff" to buy.  this isn't a valid argument.If you have no idea what’s going to happen in the financial world in the next 6-12m then 🤷‍♂️ 

Yes there’s a massive consequence to brrrrr^enter every recession before.. However.. this one is DEFINITELY different.The feds are buying debt, government debt.  Common people will have more debt than they did before, in the form of US government debt, which common people will have to pay back through taxes.You want them to avt slowly? When they adjust balance sheets it is almostinstantaneous.Oh damn. Didn’t know this.I’ll read that book. I’ve gone too far down the rabbit hole as far as China is concerned and am just trying to make sense of how it’s rise will affect the USA. 

Is it that people are still confident in the USD and the US economy? Or that there is no viable alternative yet?

China can overtake our GDP, but they might be too controlling to allow the RMB to be a global currency, fearing the instability that the RMB rising or falling can cause. Euro is out of the question due to the instability regarding the EU. 

I just look at the fact that foreign investment in the USA has dropped. USA investment in China has increased. 

The USA has been the leading economy since the world war. My lizard brain is just trying to see what happens when it is not.The situation requires it because of the super simple question the reporter posed. He is the authority on monitory policy, he doesn’t have anything to prove other than honest intentions. It went viral because it coincides with stonks only go up memes.Again, I repeat for both of you, the world economy wouldn’t collapse if the market crashed.He did yesterday.Fuck it, TSLA ∞ 7/22TSLA NaN NowExampleMY CALL HOLDERS WE DID ITYupCan you explain what you mean further?  How does the fed buying shitty bonds prevent big funds from buying shitty bonds?  What shitty bonds do you mean, the same for both?Before what IPO?How do u know about TLT? Is a call debit spread fine?Do you REALLY think the Fed will allow anything to crash before the election in November? I'm thinking that will be the catalyst, but I've got my eye on the expiration of the extra Unemployment Benefits and the PPP as well.Why would TLT go up further? The crash will come when TLT and all the other bonds are no longer having their prices propped up by the fed. Interest rates will rise to be closer to the actual level of risk and inflation and money will move out of equities to take advantage of higher rates.Apology for my post. In English speaking countries billions corresponds to thousands of millions in the rest of Europe. I meant thousands of millions (your billions). 390 bn are "free money" the rest are lowans which you will have to pay back - it is a line of credit.Thank you sir, much obligedPeople not spending and putting money into circulation is good?Sir, this is a casinoWe're not fucking grammar intellectuals, we're gamblers you son of a bitchThanks for making me laugh through the tears.Also mentions the Freudian model psyche, referring to the 'id', and what the id imagines in a strange type of 3rd person.

The entirety of the US monetary system is built on the idea that we print dollars in order to cover US treasuries.

The fed can forgive debt or it can simply print and buy more as needed. The balance sheet is just a piece of paper, printed like all those little green ones.Let’s just buy the fed.Why would the government shut down its spending? They literally spend money into existence, yes? 
Why wouldn’t they be able to service their debts? Once one ignores intra-government debts, the ND hardly even outpaces GDP growth. 

Mediocre explanation of MMT but you may find the graphs informative: https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/could-modern-monetary-theory-save-america-2c2a3ef0e185Ha! Yeah it's going great.He is not qualified to say anything about epidemiology. But he might say - well we printed shit ton of money. Capital markets are doing fine. My rich friends are rich as hell. Who cares about the plebs.🤣😂😭 Do you know who we are talking about? Pow Pow is the king of bears. He just likes printing money the same time he’s a bear. He’s a Bur.Because I didn’t know about it. I’ll have to check their volatility and decay to see if it’s worth buying. Tlt has amazing IV, to the point where you can play both ways with puts ending in November when the market is likely the highest and calls exp in Jan/March to take advantage of the swing. Try to place them both at the same dollar amount or within a 50 cent spread of the call and put. Try to work the bid ask spread from the lowest up in order to take advantage of the lowest possible price.I just skimmed 25 pages of that and it didn’t say anything about them postponing the quiet period.You don’t have to jump to the nuclear option.

Some of us like touching money (/r/silverbugs) in addition to yoloing it away.More likely now we'll have to buy actual kilos of silver to get around these ass loving fuckersBlow Jobs could be a commodity,

I though about paying the guy over the road in jelly babies to suck off people,

I think he would jump at the chance.LMAOI want to buy the dip but everyone says get a base position, when the price goes above $20 that will be the start of the bull run,

I put my base position in just in case JP can't stop the run on physical metal and the whole thing crumbles,

I put £1600 into Endeavour and it is up £960, in 3 weeks, it moved up £320 yesterday alone, there are days of sideways trading but rarely big drop days,

This could last for years with unlimited printing./SI is up 4% today after 3.5% yesterdayWe're in the dip. Have you looked at the 10 year chart for silver?Highest leverage to silver are, drum roll,

First Majestic Silver & Endeavour Silver,

I have heard Fortuna Silver Mines is another good one,

These are producers, producers will move first, which they are doing, small caps will move more but i can't get a good broker in the UK that has them,

Check out Cambridge House on You Tube.PAASLook at the other comments on this string.I put the stocks i am interested in further up the comments.I go with silver producers they are the first to move and if you choose the best like First Majestic or Endeavour Silver you get leverage on the silver price move,

Endeavour for me has moved up 38% in 2 days and 79% in 3 weeks,

It could be over in 6 months or 2 years, stocks have moved + 500% in previous runs, silver has been up at $50 before,

Both Gold & Silver have been manipulated for 20 years, unlimited fiat currency money printing backed by nothing generally pushes up the price of Gold & Silver,

The Comex and the major banks like JP Morgan will do what ever it takes to crush the price, but people are taking delivery of physical metal and the paper silver market is struggling to cope,

I am not saying the gold silver ratio could go to 20 to 1 but silver has more room to run where as gold is almost at it's all time high maybe 14% of it's highest price ever,

Silver is more of an industrial metal, when FOMO hits and people rush to buy physical silver it should help drive up prices,

Check out Cambridge House on You Tube don't hang around though it is likely to keep getting more expensive to buy in,

When big money moves back in it can go up quick.It kind of is when you look at asset inflation. If anything, it’s not necessarily that people have more money (not much wage inflation going on), it’s just the purchasing power is eroded. 

Ergo, can buy less stuff (not there’s less stuff to buy)Maybe, hasn't happened yet thoIts not zero-sum. The fed prints money and pays their debt with it, and this devalues the currency. We don't pay it back through taxes, we pay more for a loaf of bread because our money isn't worth as much.So here's one thing that a lot of people don't understand about the value of a currency because of the way our language is constructed. Renminbi is the name of the currency. Yuan is the unit of the currency. So think about this.

Let's say gold is $2,000/oz to make the math easy. Each dollar is worth 1/2000th of an ounce. Then twice as many dollars enter circulation. no goods and services were added to the economy to offset all that additional currency. So now $1 is 1/4000th of an ounce.

We don't have a way to express the value of "the dollar" as in the value of all currency transacted in dollars. So I sometimes say dollarsphere or dollarium.

If the economy keeps growing and money circulates responsibly, the value of individual dollars in comparison with the size of the economy and similar reference currencies can remain quite stable.

Even if the renminbi, that is to say, total yuan-denominated commerce, passes the dollarsphere, it doesn't mean we're shafted. The Swiss franc is a very stable currency used by one relatively small country. The same could be said for the Japanese Yen.>I just look at the fact that foreign investment in the USA has dropped. USA investment in China has increased.

The biggest factor in this is the strength of the dollar against everything else. 

>Is it that people are still confident in the USD and the US economy? Or that there is no viable alternative yet?

We continue to be on the edge of every emerging technology and market. What gives us this edge? Despite Trump, our political institutions are some of the strongest in the world.then, fuckedWait, like right now or when you first sent the comment?Sold my calls at $1634 for $181.45(bought at 93.85), reversed it into $1620 puts for $95.85, gonna buy my 1660 calls in a few minutes once it gets to $96.00. The ride will make it worthwhile for me since I expect it to jump or drop. If it stays neutral I am selling out of both at the same time to avoid decay loss. Selling profitable one at open after IPO release and holding onto the other one until the end of the day to sell while praying for a $50-100 rebound to make up for some losses.Congress and the President essentially gave the Fed trillions of dollars to provide liquidity to the market. That basically means the Fed printed a bunch of money, went out into the market, and bought bonds of terrible companies.

So if you were, say a pension fund who bought Delta and Jet Blue bonds in 2018, Corona caused you to go from owning very safe stable investment to owning very risky and garbage bonds. Without any intervention, you would sell these bonds at a huge discount in the market to whoever will buy them. Instead, the fed tells this pension fund, we will buy your garbage Delta and Jet Blue bonds at or near full price because, well, they were just given infinite money to do exactly this.

So now all the bonds of shitty companies that should have been on massive sales instead rocketed up in value because the Fed is overpaying for them with essentially infinite printed money.  So if you owned a large hedge fund and had a bunch of money to invest, you look around and expect to see all these amazing investing opportunities in bonds (very very big market) and instead you see nothing because the Fed is essentially propping up the price. So you stop looking in the bond market for returns and the only place you see a chance to get a solid return is in the equities market.The fed is buying shitty bonds at high prices. The usual buyers of shitty bonds like low prices because they want to make money for the risk. The fed buying shitty bonds at high prices means it's not worthwhile to buy shitty bonds anymore.... No good profit there. So nothing else to really invest in other than stocks. 

I mean I guess you could buy good bonds, but, the yields on then are horrible so you will barely make anything for your risk. Not worth it.Meant eps. Sorry for the mistype.I’m not smart enough to work a call debut spread, but check the tlt spreads. Do you really want to bet that it won’t skyrocket and the other party won’t exercise at the most opportune time?How about billion corresponds to 1000 million everywhere but English speaking countries recognize that there is a word for “1000 million” and that word is “billion”.That’s a myth. When you need a computer, you buy the damn computer even though they have become exponentially better every year for decades.puts on education materials it isYou son of a bitch, I'm in.Plays a role in their mess of an economy.

They're - they areIn the long run, we're all dead anyway.Because a weak dollar benefits those with debt the most.  Look at our national debt.

This punishes anyone who saved money and ran a fiscal budget, while rewarding anyone who went deep into debt and fucked up their business model.  This cycle either ends in hyper inflation or a stock market of overvalued assets with no risk, where those who have run the worst companies are rewarded the most, and those with safety moats and cautious investments are wiped out.  Or both.

Fuck this shit, man.  I was so livid when I saw this video the first time, but now I’m even more angry about it.I'm not aware of China having the means to enter into a hot war with the US - especially not anything fought beyond their own borders - which I believe is a good thing. The last thing anyone on this earth needs is China/US hot war.

I just hope the US doesn't push its weight around because of it.Cumflakes will be freeThere will be an affordable alternative provided by the government: "Corn Substitute Flakoids."I mean, technically if the fed sells out at a profit they can use it to pay off their own debt...Fuck it, if I can buy spy at $50 and reinvest dividends for 5 years to get 16,000% returns, aka $160m from a $1m investment I’ll take it and they can die. They say “fuck gay bears” well gay bears have come out of hibernation baby(in a week, with another possible wave in sept and again in December into January with the annual sell off)!Leaving the gold standard is precisely what caused double digit inflation in the 70s. Not that I care about backing the dollar with gold.In this context forgiving the debt would be akin to a sovereign default.MMT is nonsense, it is literally assuming runaway inflation and unbalanced debts will be totally fine, take a hint from history, it won’t be fine. America was successful because it avoided doing stupid shit like the Weimar RepublicMarket effects of the virus have little to do with epidemiology. He has commented on the effect of the virus on the market numerous timesGood advice thanksThey are buying back bonds and ETF till 2022. Since ETF hold 86% of US bonds as underlying, the government need to find a way to get those instruments sold. At least for bonds  you still get a brokerage fee for your trade, so traders will phone and convince their customers to shift their investment.

ETFs is a secondary market and nobody is going to make a market for these instrument, because nobody is going to buy something they can make no money with. This contract explains how the government will pay BlockRock to make the market and buy the ETF.Damn are you a hobbit?Ya that's good to just get in with a base position. If you see any big dips be ready to buy. It will consolidate and price action will be boring for ahwile.If you’re getting in to silver for the long haul look at switching some of that for physical silver. I’m assuming you’re in the UK so you’re best off getting 1oz sovereign coins. We have to pay 20% vat when buying but there is no capital gains when selling as sovereign coins are legal tender. So you won’t be into profit till it silver hits 30-32$ ish but after that it’s all pure profit. If your investment plan for silver is to hold as an inflation/ printing hedge it makes sense to buy physical now while it’s low as the vat is low so you can avoid the capital gains tax as due to inflation tax that’ll suck away all your gains.First majestic are on 212, but tbf you said good broker.Do you know of any good silver etfsThankshttps://youtu.be/RaE2md-rNI8

Come again?But inflation isn't happening?Last week. Tomorrow. Time is artificial.Whenever you wantIs this an autistic way to explain a strangle?I think you’re underestimating the IV dropAn important point remember Delta and Jet Blue in many cases sold those bonds to buy back their own stock. So now, the Fed is buying shitty bonds that went to buy stock. The process continues. Sell shit bonds to the feds and buy stock with it.Yeah, that’s an etf I think I’ll be able to see it coming. Sorry. I’m poorDude it was a mistake caused by my mother tongue... Already said it.
In Portuguese (as in most European languages) 1 billion (in English) = 1000 milhões (in Portuguese). 1 bilião (In Portuguese) = 1 trillion (in English)Stop. This is not what we are talking about, and you fucking now it.Your as in youre as in you are a grammar nazi sonnnnn haha i know my theres theirs and theyres i just dont spell check myself when posting on wsb, ill admit doe i didnt even think about roll probably wouldnt have caught that irregardless ;PYou're letting your emotions dictate the day. 

According to you, Facebook, Amazon, NVDIA, and Google have run their companies into the ground and the Fed is propping them up. AMD isn't positioning themselves to overtake Intel. Tech isn't the future....You know this none of this is true, and you know the stocks doing the worst right now are those in fact that are in the most trouble. 

You're angry because money is an imaginary concept, and imaginary concepts can be manipulated, and the people in a position to manipulate in their favor are the people in power. You failed to take that into consideration and are now crying over whatever bad position you took in the market.

Life isn't fair. But don't make it harder on yourself by lying to yourself.Someone’s still in bear mode huh. Come to the bullside. You HAVE to remember America is at war and the US consumer is the soldier. The govt will not allow the American consumer to default or enter bankruptcy.Haha nerd BRRRRRRRRRCornflakes were invented to suppress the urge to masterbate. Cumflakes are their natural oppositeThat’s over simplistic. Overly inflationary monetary policy drove that inflation, you can have low inflation with non-gold backed currency. It just requires discipline in the central bank, which Volcker broughtMMT frames inflation at the center of its discussion... it is the ultimate limitation on government spending.
In instances like Weimar and Zimbabwe there were shortages of real resources contributing to the problem... to optimize inflation government spending would consider increasing the productive output as a consequence of that spending, etc etc...
The ratio of real resources to *circulating* currency is a good function to model inflation.I would contend, business would suffer or gain depending on the outcomes of things epidemiology would say. If R0 was less than 0.1 we would have different market, don't you think?Oh I figured that was going to happen when the day before WFC eps they changed the bank regulations so they can work more closely with hedge funds, aka share inside information.I'm short and overeat for breakfast, what are you saying?LOLI do see all trading 212 issues but i haven't had any, yes they front run you, sell your data to hedge funds, but they all do,

Knowing to buy into the right area and make small profit is better than buying into an option with the hopes of rapid gains. You will lose a lot of money if you’re hoping a stock is going to drop $2+ in a day unless you’re dealing with large caps in which the price of options is definitely out of budget. What’s your budget and what kind of plays do you want to make? Do you want to bet with the market or against the market and long term vs short term? I might be able to help you find something that is reasonable within your budget.No. Your argument is that deflation causes people to stop spending because they could wait for a better deal in the future. I showed you a realistic example in our current economy that disproves that. If I’m missing your point, let me know.I get that I’m being emotional here, but I’m also rooted in fact.  If you go out and borrow more money than you are worth, you don’t have a business model - you have temporary good faith.  Any system run on debt is bound to have exponential growth until it doesn’t.

This is the end of a long term debt cycle.The consumer loses purchasing power when their dollar is worth less and consumer goods cost more.  Wage stagnation since the 1970s has done nothing but reduce the average American’s purchasing power while forcing them to put more purchases on credit.  The banks will be the ultimate bag holders this time when they realize they’re never getting their credit card payments and loans back.

Dude I’m homeless and have $10,000 of credit available to me.  This system is fucking stupid.>The govt will not allow the American consumer to default or enter bankruptcy.

You sure about that?  [Credit availability is super low right now](https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/nfci/index) if you don't have signficant income or collateral, and the lack of household bailouts is essentially the fed. government allowing the economic disenfranchisement of millions.  We're also seeing significant deleveraging by those same households - as the reality of diminished access to credit + stimulus checks and the +$600/week extra unemployment are pushing people to pay down whatever they can in prep for a near term future that is significantly less liquid than before.

Paying Blackrock a fee to buy these ETFs at a premium is pure market manipulation. Not saying it is right or wrong. But these are practices of a banarepublic - and you can keep on doing it forever, until people stop trusting the politicians.I’m exactly the same. I actually use 212 on an ISA account, they just have very few mining stocks and even fewer junior mining stocks, otherwise I’d have been invested in Freegold ventures which is up a couple thousand (not a typo) percent in 3 months.Well just got an email from Robinhood. Looks like we ain’t getting it in the U.K.Printing endless money = hyperinflationAre you?What price are you expecting SQQQ to go?   


Thinking it will go to 10 dollars means you're expecting about a 15-20% correction in Nasdaq.If people only bought what they needed we would all have two pairs of shoes and 7 shirts.

Your argument only works for things that people NEED. And need in the most strict sense of the word. All discretionary spending is halted. 

Inflation fucks low and medium class people. Inflation helps you pay your mortgage. Deflation fucks you over.no its not. That was 2008.

This is a. zombie like state of things that never got fixed.

Also, please explain in 10 words or less where the money will go to in a zero interest rate world. Under the mattress?But what is that number? When is the music going to stop? How much gains are you going to miss out on or how much money you are going to throw away buying puts and sitting in cash? 

The Fed's whole existence is around managing the money supply. Just as they can print money into existence they can poof it out of existence as well when inflation starts revving up.How much did you lose today?Again, I point to the companies doing well in the SP 500. Are they profitable? Yes. So where does your little sob story get its merit?LONG $SQ... stop being a berrThat’s also not true. No one needs a GTX 2080ti, but people buy it anyway even though they could just wait for the 3080ti that would be four times as good for a similar price!

Let’s say you’re right. Let’s try it in reverse. If deflation causes people to wait to spend, does inflation cause people to rush to spend now? That would mean people don’t have any savings (many people don’t for other reasons, but stay with me here) because they think that if they get everything now then they’d be getting a deal.I can’t write “digital money alternatives” but it will flow into those and foreign currencies.  Out of the NYSE and out of America.They can’t poof it out of existence.  Investors will pull their money out of the stock market and it will add to the M2 money supply where it will just cause insane inflation out of the market.I made $80 lol.Are they profitable *right now* or is the market looking forward two to five years?>that would mean people don’t have any savings

That would mean that people don't have savings in cash. And that's exactly what is happening, people place their savings into stocks and property.yes yes yes, you spend the money now rather than later. 

I grew up in a country that had 10/20% inflation a month back in the day. 
My parents would do their monthly groceries as soon as the paycheck came in cause the same money would be worth less 2 weeks on. 

Nothing changes the fact that people only spend what they can. 
Savings accounts usually pay a little more than inflation.They absolutely can. When the government, banks and corporations pay back their loans to the fed, when the fed raise interest rates, when the fed raises the reserve requirements of banks, when they shut down their alphabet soup lending facilities. All of those things take money out of the economy. 

There will be inflation, because that's what would trigger them taking away the punch bowl, but the fed has the power to stop hyperinflation, which they will do if they are doing their job. We haven't seen even seen regular inflation yet, though.Reddit Inc. has banned Seeking Alpha articles because their payout model strongly encourages spam.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*I made 10 woo woo wooWhen this bubble pops and people pull money out of the market, the ball wont be in the FED’s court any more though.  You’ll have average Americans who made or lost fortunes in the markets as a direct result of helicopter money by the FED to corporations and unemployment payments as well as stimulus.  None of that money existed before - it was just “printed digitally,” and it will go into people’s bank accounts, incapable of being pulled back by the FED.Where do you think that is money going? The fed doesn't care if you stuff your money in a mattress, you're in fact helping the fed take money out of the economy. Inflation is caused by people \*spending\* money. 

When they try to buy a house or a car and interest rates are higher, banks are more restrictive in who they lend money to meet their reserve requirements, business loans are more expensive, all of that will take money out of the system. 

Stock market will go down as well, perhaps that's what you are concerned about? Well, yeah. If interest rates go up, if people pull money out of the market, all of that will make the stock market go down, but that's a side effect of taking money out of the economy.Lol you referred to the stock market as the economy.

Take your ten-dollar allowance out of your electronic ATM piggy-bank and invest it with anything that’s trendy and then you’ll get two gold stars ⭐️⭐️I'm waiting for OP and you to update us once you've been banned from r/NikolaCorporationI work in the energy industry and these guys are batshit insane. They want 17 MW dc capacity, which is comparable to a town of 10,000 people all using power at the exact same moment, and they believe they can get that power for $0.03 per kWh. National average is like $0.13, not to say the demand cost would be astronomical.


The whole thing is fugazi and they know it deep down inside.

This is something the gas industry spent years of research and $MM looking into for a transition from gas/ natural gas into hydrogen storage and delivery. Even they decided it was fucked and we already have electricity infrastructure all around us built in and ready to recharge vehicles and class 8 trucks.

Nikola is DOAAnd it always will be. It's horribly inefficient and a terrible idea.
NKLA is doomed to fail and it's painfully obvious.Yeah hydrogen is just an energy storage medium AKA shitty gaseous swapable battery 💥 BOOM 💥But building the hydrogen infrastructure is the whole point for these companies. Otherwise, the lose control of the supply. 

It's nonsensical though. Except for applications like aviation(*), where you could potentially want to pay the premium to store more energy than batteries, it's just a middle man. Expensive, finicky, embrittling middle-man. Just use the power to charge batteries directly. Expend effort in building public charge infrastructure and expand battery recycling logistics. 

(*) hydrocarbons are a pretty good way to store hydrogen... I don't think that will change for a while.Lol... what hydrogen infrastructure? It simply doesn’t exist in any meaningful form.Its like the Junior level of Gates or Zuckerberg, except they dropped out of Harvard where he dropped out of UVUThis motherfucker is going to scam investors out of more money than Adam NeumannI mean he’s already a multi millionaire so I respect the hustleElizabeth Holmes long lost, less successful brother.

This market goes pants-on-head retarded for faux green virtue signalling tickers.Investors are desperate to catch a Tesla competitor early.I bought Ericsson calls and held them for a month until I sold the day before expiration because they weren’t gonna print.

So don’t feel too bad, you chest smacking retard, we all make bad calls sometimes.I had the $60c 7/24s, bought on the Monday it was near $58, then everything went down. It hovered around $55 so my calls went from $1.50 to .19 cents. Sold this past Monday sold for a massive loss and used the proceeds for other stuff. After yesterday they were up 800% single day and now $2.30 each.

I studied hydrogen fuel cells while I was in college getting my engineering degrees. It’s simply not a viable solution when you examine it under the proverbial ‘thermodynamic lens’. In other words; hydrogen fuel cells don’t pass the test that every successful invention must first pass... does it abide by the natural laws of the universe... it must be efficient enough to justify its use. For example, let’s say you needed to get from New York to Chicago: if flights, rail, and cars were so expensive that you had to spend 2 years working at your job to save up the money to afford the ticket to get there... you’d save yourself a hell of a lot of time and effort by just walking there. So, that’s essentially what the 3rd law of thermodynamics explains. There are several formula derived from this theory and an applicable one allows us to calculate thermodynamic efficiency. A perfectly made (and I mean like Enzo Ferrari would jizz if he ever saw one) internal combustion engine (diesel) attains less than 50% thermal efficiency. But it’s energy source comes from the ground... like water... we don’t have to make it. For hydrogen fuel cells we use a thermal efficiency equivalent called ‘Gibbs Free Energy’. I don’t want to rant on and on so I’ll end by saying that this is where we see fuel cells fail under the microscope. And it’s a fundamental failure because hydrogen really likes to hook itself up to oxygen. Like enough so that it needs to be karate chopped off and dragged away to be stored in a high pressure prison. Hydrocarbon fuels are just chilling on the ground... nothing is trying to bond with it... no karate chopping required. Just boil it a little bit and distill out that good good . It’s not that I’m biased or jilted towards $NKLA it’s that I’m offended that this Trevor Milton guy is disturbingly successful at convincing people to send him their hard earned money so that he can recklessly gamble with it to build something that probably won’t work the way he says it will.Why spend time making CGI movies about a fake product when you can just keep photoshopping new fake products.... like their jet ski!Maybe put a leaping whale in there, too - worked well for Magic LeapWhy hire employees to do that when you can Adam Neumann^(tm) it and just sell hopes and dreams?\*theirThey have real prototype test beds of semis that haven't actually been proven to function as semis (i.e. hauling a a heavy load) and which were purchased from third party companies.Shit companies get pump and dumped all the timeThat doesnt exist yetRandom number generatorJpow rents the money printer out for side workLol yep, the mods there ban any and all critical voices from that sub, even if you don't actually post in that sub.

They will also add an assembly line to build the trucks automatically when workers get tired of hand-building and wants some rest. 

Their factory in the U.S. will further integrate their business in conjunction with Ulm factory. They're focused on high margin low production models like Trucks, similar to what Tesla did, but also making jet skis and pick up trucks to make more money.

Like purchase hertz stock when the board explicitly says it expects ‘the stock to be worthless’, or give your money to some crazy lady who never blinks and tells you she can do blood tests with micro-liters of blood when the industry leaders require over a thousand times that for the same test, or in this case... give your money to a guy who couldn’t make it through a single semester of junior college when he tells you he can invent and build highly sophisticated cars and the entire refueling infrastructure to go along with it... oh and that he thinks he has discovered a way around that pesky third law of thermodynamics. The SEC isn’t responsible for teaching you how to detect bullshit. Trevor Milton and Elizabeth Holmes appear to genuinely believe their own lies... so the SEC can’t fault them for being idiots.Robinhood and gullible people not wanting to miss "the next Tesla", plus a lot of inflated short-term interest from people making a play off their warrants offering.That's just the price of energy during those times. To wheel it in and congestion charges are going to add 2 to 3 per kWhDepends on the specifics of what kind of plane and what kind of tradeoffs you're willing to accept. If you're talking a commercial jet or even private jet most certainly not. If you're talking a small conventional prop plane like a Cessna or Piper then certainly. But even with those there will be tradeoffs on range, speed, storage capacity, etc. It looks like there's at least one company working on a hydrogen plane in the size, but I wouldn't expect hydrogen planes as a concept to catch on anytime soon. After all, even if the planes existed today you'd have to install the distribution infrastructure to refuel them.Which is expensive and requires tons of power to perform the electrolysis (that power could instead be put directly into batteries much more efficiently and, from a consumer's perspective, more conveniently from home, work, the gym, etc.)Toyota would be nothing without Americans going there in the 70s and showing them how to run a manufacturing business.

They are not creative. They’re very good at copying.First off, no. Secondly, type IV hydrogen tanks are pressurized to 10,000psi... that kind of pressure can kill you without a flame.Vapor ...There are practical limits but we still have ways to go.

Ill buy NKLA at 10$.I was wondering if a commercial hydrogen fuel cell jet would be more viable and come along sooner than an electric jet. I was thinking if hydrogen was the executive energy for the skys that the infrastructure would actually be easier to set up at airports than the amount you would need for cars. Your analysis was really helpful in showing me why that wouldn't be viable,  so thank you.It's really not expensive at all and doesn't require much power. Yes - batteries are cheaper right now, but so is oil. The goal in the project is to be able to do it without using precious metals. Power cost is minimal.  


Source: I worked on that project and hold 4 patents from it.Ironically, my employer has opted to copy 100% of their processes from the 80s. It's like re-living my state-school business education.Wrong.


The Toyota Way, with the Toyota Production System and Lean Manufacturing is the basis of all manufacturing optimization as we know it.

Source: Industrial Engineering DegreeI think you got your facts backwards or are a troll. Look up the Toyota way.Ironically American car manufacturing was churning out completely turds in the 70s.  Would you like a 120 horsepower 4000 lb boat that can’t stop, can’t turn, and gets 8 mpg, and will kill you in a wreck?  Have we got the car for you!It could... And that's why the tanks were tested extensively and ruled safe for collisions.... which is what it would be in this application. Cars arent going to be just cruising around while also trying to cool the hydrogen down to cryo temps just to keep it liquid. You need more than pressure to keep hydrogen in any state other than gas.>iborrowdesk

nicediamond handing these $35 P till tomorrowI actually had the opportunity to try a Magic Leap 1 headset, it does exist, but...

\- It only renders in a rectangle that covers MAYBE generously 40% of your field of vision so the images get cut off even if you're looking directly at them most of the time.

\- It's laggy so when you move your head the image doesn't follow properly.

\- The wearable computer attached to it doesn't have a very powerful GPU, so the frame rate is terrible, and the graphics aren't very good.

\- There's no occlusion of the images by objects in front of them.  So for example if you hold your hand in front of your face they will be drawn on top of your hand even though your depth perception sees them as further away.

\- The lighting of the rendered images don't try to match your environment at all.

\- This one I would say is forgivable but the images are always transparent.

All in all, not even a little bit immersive.  It did not, even for a second, feel like the images I was seeing in the headset were in the environment in front of me.  The technology just isn't there yet to achieve what they've been promising.Thine![deleted]I’m just grinning like an asshole reading thisAre you retarded? Every new auto startup works with 3rd party OEMs to makeup for a lack of production experience and equipment.Really lol?You belong hereYou really needed a /s in there. Couldn’t tell if you were seriousCatalysts like platinum, iridium, and rhodium aren't expensive? Power in The MW range to fuel the electrolysis process isn't expensive? Massive amounts of potable water, a resource that's only expected to decline sharply in the near future, won't become more expensive? That's all news to me.

Oh so you have a vested interest in promoting this flawed tech? Gotcha. Well I have 18,000 patents in hydrogen tech from working on that project, and I say it's too expensive.The usage of precious metals in batteries is definitely a concern until there's a major battery development. What do you think is a reasonable assumption for the power required by electrolysis?You work for Honeywell?In the late 50s toyota moved to California and it is only at that point they started being able to compete.

Too many shady questions about the company.[deleted]You mean their prototype test bed platforms (two semis) that A) were entirely built by third parties (not Nikola) and B) are probably not even close to being production ready (the videos show those prototypes can drive 20mph in a parking lot with no freight, get at me when they can go 65mph up an incline hauling 80,000lbs)?Can you buy it? No. So it doesn't exist.
What exists is one pre-production manually built alpha dummy version of it. That's not worth billions.Fully vertically integrated while also outsourcing all production?Lol Tesla didn't. The closest Tesla came was buying the Glider bodies from Lotus but that wasn't an OEM partnership, that was an ordinary customer/supplier purchase, and the Glider bodies were for sale to anyone who wanted to buy them for kit cars. Tesla has never partnered with an OEM. And in any case, the word "partnership" implies both parties are bringing something to the table. In the case of Nikola, the OEM would bring valuable production capabilities while Nikola would bring . . . what exactly?Well I could tell by the end. But given this sub, I wouldn’t be shocked if someone was super Nikola bullNo arguments thereLol no vested interest - I got out of the field 15 years ago. I'm just saying it doesn't have to be expensive. It would be if you used precious metals, but my group found similar efficiencies using common nano metals like tin, cobalt and nickel. The massive surface areas allow them to behave like the precious metals but at a fraction of the cost. And we used very little water. Potassium Hydroxide was much more efficient as we could just take waste product from the cement industry.Don't argue man, he's an idiot.We always got around the power issue by doing a sort of inverted system. Power costs are substantially lower in the middle of the night vs. middle of the day, so by producing hydrogen all night and then shutting down the system during the day, you have a much better cost ratio. We also had pretty good luck with smaller electrodes running common nano metals, which greatly improved our efficiency. I wouldn't be able to speak to their current benchmarks as it's been over a decade, but I would assume it's not too far behind batteries.No but similar industry. I take it you’re a kaizen guy?I don’t know where you got this idea... I’m not the one you replied to, but I’d like to chime in. 

Toyota did not learn about manufacturing from the Americans. In fact, the exact opposite is *very famously* true.

Toyota is a famous case of broad revolutionary change to the world of manufacturing, and the Toyota philosophy of manufacturing is so well known that it is taught about in engineering schools around the world. In multiple classes throughout my own engineering schooling in the US, we were taught about Toyota’s manufacturing prowess.

I now work in automotive engineering in the US, and we send our manufacturing engineers to the Toyota plants to learn from them because they are so famous for manufacturing innovation. I know for a fact that many more American companies do this too.

Toyota pioneered the concepts of lean manufacturing and “just in time” manufacturing. These techniques are now used in pretty much every modern factory around the world, far beyond just automotive.

It should be very easy for you to look this up.Volvo was doing three point seat belts by the 70s.  Do you realize how popular cars like the civic were when they were released?  It wasn’t just the oil embargo.  They  were nicer to drive and maintain.  Not everyone wanted a muscle car.  Of course Japan copies some of our techniques but they made them better in nearly every way.

Have you torn apart a Lexus UZ V-8 and seen the amazing engineering work they did when they saw the success of the S class Mercedes?  They see what is working and make it better.  You can’t argue it.  Unless you’re stupid I guess.DIAMOND HANDS!I haven't tried the hololens, and admittedly I feel like the demos I was shown for the Magic Leap weren't designed with it's limitations in mind.  Then again, I still don't think you could meet the expectations they've built up within it's limitations.[deleted]Why would you fully vertically integrate to then go and outsource production. That’s the worst of both worlds. You spend tons of capital buying tons of shit you won’t use because you’re not producing in house. 

You vertically integrate so you can cut out the middle men of production shops.Even assuming you could scale a potentially cheaper catalyst, there is still the much larger problem of power consumption and the workable problem of diminishing potable water supply. Hydrogen may be the energy source of the future, but that isn't likely and it definitely won't be Nikola who delivers it.I took your advice and looked it up.Please do the same.

The below article is easy enough reading.

https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/adventure/red-line/the-rise-of-japan-how-the-car-industry-was-won/article27100187/Nice hit. Still waiting for my position to go green so hopefully it keeps drilling.You still holding until close?I should also mention that I pursued a degree in digital animation after high school.  My standards in this field are probably higher than the average person's.I'm not talking about mass production, I'm talking about regular production. Nikola hasn't produced a single product. Nikola bought the two test beds from third party companies (Bosch and Iveco that I know of), and who knows what those test beds can actually do because the only evidence they do anything is some short videos that notably don't show the truck hauling a fully loaded trailer up an incline or for even the promised range on level ground. Any legitimate automaker with this much scrutiny on them would have immediately shot a video of the truck driving on a track fully loaded for the 500 miles or whatever Nikola claims, but for some reason Nikola instead likes to make useless short videos where they drive unloaded test beds around a parking lot for 10 minutes. That's pretty weird in my opinion.You must not listen to Trevor's interviews, it is not what I am saying, it is what he is saying.You completely missed the point dude. Nikola claimed they would be fully vertically integrated. That was their claimed business model. Now they’ve completely changed to outsourcing damn near everything. Nobody is arguing about the merit of the business models themselves. It’s the fact that Nikola lies/changes narratives every couple weeks.Yeah that's the problem, any normal, legitimate business would do one or the other. There are arguments to be made for taking either approach to the exclusion of the other. Nikola, as Trevor Milton claims, is somehow, inexplicably doing both. It makes absolutely no sense.Of course they claimed to fully vertically integrate. That attracts the smart business folk with the $$$. Now they’re outsourcing because the company is just a big pump and dumpYeah This sub is retarded, not sure why I’m being downvoted lol 😂...yes.

You should learn about something called the dot.com crash.Porto caralho!What happenedTo clarify for the non antiquated, you can be off-side at any point in the attacking play, only when you receive the ball in an offside position does it get called. 

As the player lets the pass roll on whilst hes off side its fine, by the time the ball is passed his way one of the CBs has tracked back to bring him on.

Well done sir.Yeah, by older soccer rules, that could have been justly called offsides because the player gained an advantage by being in the position. Nowadays, it's a little more geared towards whether they are recieving the ball.i love that this post has just turned into a big argument over the offside rule.$FCP calls printingYou're a beautiful goalUnrelated but check out this one:

Little tiny country did very well overall, and fuck did they party after every win, giant raves all across downtowns, just a giant party. So much fucking funCampeões caralho!!Lmfao what’s funny is that it’s spiking hard with TSLA so is SOLO. The EVStuck for ages yet it jumps 9% when they make a press release about CPUs that have been on their roadmap, partnerships that they've already had, etc

Been holding shares since $14 or some crap so I'm not complaining but the way it moves never makes any sense.

Too bad it's hard to ever make sense of it because uhm:

 https://imgur.com/WuaxjXS.jpgLike milkBenfica bears not having a good time rnMe too man, but this goal takes it...CAMPEÕES CARALHO !!!! :PJust to clarify this, you *can* be offsides while not receiving the ball. The official wording is "involved in the play." So had he ran toward, or stepped over, or dummied the ball, while technically not touching it, can still be called offsides. 

In this video, he's running in the opposite direction of the ball, so clearly not involved. So yes, legal playThey won the championshipYou mean overvalued?FC Porto. But they don't always play like this hahahaSince solar installs tripled from Q1 to Q2. Their energy side is going to eclipse cars right when their auto brand peaks, this company will print for the next decadeTesla adds value via software updates. Cars are going the way of phones: platforms where software dominates all else. It's obviously technology.Their autopilot is you fuckertonNot offsides cause he runs back to get behind the ball before the ball is played. Wasn’t involved in the play up till the ball is played to him so goal standsnah, legal.

Zoom didnt try to touch the ball.LOL. You clearly don't know the rules.$MANU puts it isNot ebough advert breaks for Americans. Hurts their attention spans.Try FIFA, cleanest sports game (I do like 2K as well, though)Behind the ball, didn’t touch it on the first passno he didn't, he literally had to run away from the goal to avoid being offsides and then run back towards the goalThat language is absolutely still in the rule. A player is deemed to be offside if they are in advance of the second to last defender and "involved in active play", "interfere with an opponent", or "gain an advantage" by being in that position.

[Case in point Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s equalizer versus United that was called off because Sigurdsson was in an offside position lying on the pitch in the eyeline of De Gea](https://inews.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/everton-goal-man-utd-var-referee-gylfi-sigurdsson-offside-dominic-calvert-lewin-403560)Definitely not offside under any rules. Did not gain an advantage, and corrected the fact that he had been in an offside position.Came here for this exact explanation. Thanks.The offside player never interfered or influenced play, even by older rules he wouldn’t have been called offside anyways.It's my two favorite subs combined.Caralhohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2WsVHbD7zg

Fifa is one of the worse popular games out there in general. Scripting, terrible AI, loot box mechanics.He was offside before tesla ran through which technically means that should not be a goal. Probably a retarded assistant refYeah he came back to the line before the passThere's definitely an advantage by being in the position, just not the specific kind of advantage that will get the offside call. If you don't think there's an advantage from being in that position, you're overlooking the fact that by simply being there, the defenders have to take the time to assess whether he actually is in offside position - thereby diverting attention away from the player who does receive the ball and immediately passes to the guy who was just recently in the offside position. Definitely an advantage gained, just not the kind FIFA determines as an offense.To claim that the two players who were in the offside position did not influence the play is categorically untrue. Ask a defender if they influenced the play. Older rules did not so tightly constrain the specific advantages gained to make it an offsides offense.  It more simply put that gaining an advantage by being in the position was enough for an offsides offense. That would justify the call. There's also the aspect that over time the custom of enforcing rules has changed. I remember watching the WC in South Africa (what year was that?) and thinking that 15 years ago, players wouldn't get away with that kind of physical contact. I always laugh about how lax the refs are about throw-in. Unless they're launching it,  refs at pro levels could give a shit about two feet on the ground. If im wrong, feell free to tell me how, but I was a ref in the 90's and had to take the whole class and test and whatnot, and I remember the offsides rule left more to ref discretion than current FIFA rule.Too far from play and didn't make any motion to become involved in active play. I wouldn't have called that even under the old rules.Takes contact first. Puts every other dude on skates. Class.Not this?

https://youtu.be/RM_5tJncHwwI was thinking my shields and your sword...Leicester - Man U is pretty even.

If I need a commuter car as a poor, I can pay $9k and get a new 5 door Mitsubishi.


Once you start paying Lexus prices, you buy a Tesla.Nio has 300x the sales of solo you autist 😂Don't they only supply apple with graphics cards? 

Should be more than cancelled out by all the laptop CPU partners they'll be picking up.Lol consolesMeh, they're a relatively small customer of theirs. Servers and workstations are where most of their profits come from. Custom stuff like the consoles have been a bedrock, but isn't the largest earner for them, and consumer stuff (including high-end desktops) is more of an (important) added bonus. 

Frankly, they're lucky Apple haven't gobbled them up (e. g. AuthenTec style) or sucked them for their knowledge and fucked them over (Imagination Technologies style).They won 6 - 1You will in 10 yearsLOL. It’s not offside because at 0:12 Zoom leaves the ball for Tesla who is onside. When Tesla passes the ball back to Zoom, he (Tesla) is the furthest player forward (GK doesn’t count) so Zoom is onside.I need to be about 4 pints in. Helps the passion flowYes, I like itHe didn't interfere with play. Not offsideIf you pause it, he's in the offsides position when the ball was played.  Him not receiving the ball along with running away from the goal kept it from being called offsides.  30 years ago, it's likely that would've been called offsides. That was my initial point.

Edit: There's actually two players in the offsides position when the ball is played, but neither of them recieved or attempted to play the ball from that position.Once a player is in an offside position, the defenders literally do not need to worry about him. By your definition, any player in an offside position gains an advantage because the defenders have to think about them. That's definitely not what determines whether being in an offside position results in a player being involved in the play or gaining an advantage or disadvantaging the defending side.It's still there. Law 11 Section 2 clearly states:

> making an obvious action which clearly impacts on the ability of an opponent to play the ball

The fact the player in offside didn't attempt to engage in active play rendered no offense. If he started to run in to become active in play the AR may have likely put his flag up. They make us consider effect, position of defender, and distance to play in making appropriate calls.The rules haven't changed. All you have to do is be considered interfering with the play to be offside. It was like this 30 years ago and it's like this nowA cause I can get behind.I’ve been avoiding the soccer subreddits bc of that Kepa shitshow today yet it follows me even here :(Imagine being Sarri in that position: you're whole team showing how much they don't care about live in the biggest league in the world and in the midst of all that, you can't smoke a cigHonestly doubt Kepa will play against wolves, Willy all the wayI would put Man U as favourites for the Leicester game. Leicester really struggle without the creativity of Maddison, he's been out since re-starting from the coronavirus break and it shows.> Leicester - Man U is pretty even. 

Not really...Leicester is missing out on many key players and they've been in the shittiest form post lockdown.Lol at thinking Leicester/Man u is even. Leicester have lost their spark since games returned.Solo has 1/30th the market cap fuckwad. They're just getting started. I'm  just telling you they have an actual reason to go up. NIO does as well but the valuation has ballooned quick after languishing for-fucking-ever.The Apple partnership is so minor anyways.  Laptop GPUs on low margin, etc. They probably make a little more off the Mac Pro GPUs, but super low volume.

Doesn't matter to AMD at this point, they've been after the cloud and professional market all along with Zen, and it's starting to work.

The laptop and desktop wins were basically just easier for them to get into and get their reputation backThey already got their bump from that, but yes, the income per quarter should keep them floating, all I am saying is look for a stupid as as dip when Apple finally announces.So? I remember investing in Bombardier once when there were some jet ski accidents and their stock tanked like 20% because they made a few jet skis, you couldn't even find that income on their balance sheet.

Apple dumping AMD will spread like a virus among social media and news outlets, after that it will be time to get into AMD, but you are a going to be doing the down thing if you stick in it before the announcement.You're assuming that autopilot will take over vehicles by storm in 10 years. However, this will not happen. Besides the the consumer wariness, the job loss would be staggering. Do you honestly think governments would allow that? No.I don't see Ford or Toyota putting Tesla tech in their vehicles. I also don't see everyone driving Tesla's. So, how does this work?I get the beauty of the game. It’s the same with hockey. Set ups. Passes. Etc 

But god damn I tried. You get to almost shot on goal and bam bad pass or guy takes it away and the start over again

When you have our sports with a ton of action that’s why we can’t get into soccerOh okay I get you. Personally I’m glad they changed that then. Every failed/unattempted run past the line could potentially be game changing.Why are you putting an S at the end?It’s called offside not offsides ffs.It’s not offsides because he’s behind the player that’s playing the ballI agree with most of what you just said.  The rules are very distinct as to what constitutes an offside offense, especially in terms of gaining an advantage. You can gain an advantage, but as long as is not the advantages outlined in the rules, it's not an offside offense. My claim is that the rules used not to be so constrained regarding what advantage would constitute an offside offense.Are you telling me that the 1990 FIFA rules have the exact same language regarding offside as they do today? I wish I could find a 1990 edition to verify that. I feel certain the language today is more elaborative.I really thought you had a chance after the Pulisic goal. If Kepa knew how to leave his line you guys definitely would have had it in the bag.Can’t wait for arsenal to win the FA cupUnited is knackered though. They have played 9 matches this month with pretty much the same starting 11“Solo has actually launched something” lmao you fucking bum. If you believe NIOs overvalued compared to solo you’re a fucking king of autistsFor sure, but AMD are safe for the medium term.Because Tesla is on track of becoming the electric version of a Toyota Camry.

Tesla figures out how to get their car to 25k, and they will destroy the market even more.. And their tech will be used by companies like Uber/Lyft, to have autonomous cars on the rode. Removing their most expensive asset, humans. 100% of profits from a ride go back to them.

there are tons of reasons.. Also, you don't see these companies right now using their tech, but things can quickly change in the future.That's fair haha. It's a literal culture in the UK which helps a lot. Literally if you're a lad there's never awkward silences because you just go who do you support.

I've tried with the American sports and the only one I liked was hockey tbf. Football and baseball were ad riddled cancer tbh.There's pros/cons both ways. Current rules put the onus of the defending players to recognize when players are offsides and therefore not legal recipients of the ball - thus, they don't have to defend them. This play is a really good illustration of that.  If all defenders were exactly aware of the two players in the offsides position, they might've better been able to defend against the one legal recipient of the back heel pass.  And it's hard to argue that they didn't gain an advantage from being in their offsides positions; they just didn't gain the specific advantage that would get the refs whistle.  But if they had not been menacing the defenders by being in the offsides position, that goal might've never been scored. Im not saying it should have been called, but merely pointing out the nuance of the rules and the impact of them.Because there were two of em!Im sayin it wrong!It’s cause of the NFL. 20+ years of listening to “ OFFSIDES, ON THE DEFENSE, 5 YARD PENALTY, STILL FIRST DOWN”Not that pass, the one before that. During the back heel pass, two players were in the offsides position.  Neither were called offsides by today's rules.  The rules used to be much less specific regarding a player in the offsides position gaining an advantage by being in the position, which could constitute an offsides call regardless of whether they decided to play the ball.That's true...but I think a knackered but consistently good performing team has a better chance of winning than a team performing horribly plus missing a few key players.Ballooned quick does not equal overvalued. Your attempts at a strawman argument suck ass btw.   


Its trough-to-peak increase was 700% in 3 months. That's what ballooned means.   


Go buy some OTM FDs you retard.I just prefer not to surf through a dip I know is coming.Have you watched the news in the past few months? Lol joking aside, what makes you believe the product will sell? When the market poops, people save more, spend less, and invest less. If the economy contracts, who in the world will be lined up to buy TSLA product to justify such an astronomical price right now? (and not only TSLA product: any expensive automotive or tech product really)

Besides what you have already stated, what is your rationale behind TSLA's current price (besides "o look stock go boom to moon, buy now")? It sure isn't profitability, PE ratios, or coming from glancing at the balance sheets. I really want to know where this positive sentiment is coming from (especially from someone posting about call options and, possibly, engaging in options trading with TSLA of all things lol).

Help me see what you see.Baseball is boring too unless you’re at the game

And yes football i can’t explain why the rest of the world doesn’t love. But I was at Tottenham to watch a couple of games and everyone at the stadium loved it. Also stadium is really fucking nice

My buddy likes the forest. Said I should pick a team since we were dry on sports. So I’ll go with Tottenham cause I visited there and millwall cause I hear their fans are nutty cunts and their slogan is fuck u I’m millwall lolAm american and honestly the only sport that keeps my attention is rugby. I just dont understand why that isnt a bigger sport. More fun to play, more fun to watch.Ah yes, classic WSB discourse.Ah didn’t think about it that way. In this I don’t particularly think it should’ve been called but I get how that rule could be abused.Yeah that, and no one gives a shit about soccerwatching hand egg concussion ball is where it goes wrongI thought the rule was wether or not they were affecting the play and objectively they did nothingIn rugby we call them laws, not rules. The laws are subject to interpretation :). But yes, you're 100% correct here.For someone nitpicking the rules so damn much, why the fuck do you keep calling offside the wrong thing?you guys fighting over EVs is making me super hard. please continueHow many times did you comment and edit?

Truth is simple, this pandemic isn’t affecting middle to upper class citizens as much as it’s affecting lower class. The average person who could afford as Tesla, still can somewhat afford a Tesla. These were never cheap cars. Sure, things will drop, but not as bad as we though anymore. 

The market? This market doesn’t have fundamentals anymore. You can chart it, graph it, and throw all all the buzzwords you learned and it still won’t reflect the economy. Next, this economy will be propped by the federal reserve, period. EV incentives will be extended, as well. 

Recent research also showed more Americans spent their stimulus check than saved it. Now add pent up demand, we are bound for a good rebound.


This is all can obviously change if tomorrow Covid picks up and clears out 10% of the population. I’m aware of it. But at the current moment in time, market sell of IMO is because whales are cashing in on the 300% Gains they have had in 3 months. Long term, I’m beyond bullish. 


At least I hope I’m not wrong. Because if I’m wrong, then we are screwdd


Tesla is the front runner for all things self driving and that’s the future, period.Lol I played rugby till a few years ago and moved on after some horrendous injuries. Then moved onto water polo and the same. Probably why I'm in this place with all the knocks I took...I gotta say - no way that goal should have counted. 2 of 3 players offsides virtually in the keepers box made that impossible to defend. The rule change sucks.Tbh if there’s no violence it’s not a sport worth watching. If I wanted to watch soccer I’d join a soccer league and go run around and kick the ball like a little fairyObjectively they forced the defenders to cover even the offsides players, which led to the goal.Care to elaborate or just want to make an accusation without an explanation?Fuck you you’re wrong I fucked your cousinDude, took so many damn head hits as a lineman growing up, rugby seemed so much better. Had migraines all the time from the hitting, played for 8 years and hated every bit of it. Only played rugby for 2 seasons and that was in an adult league so no crazy shit and everyone was respectful. Well except the one time a dude took a cheap shot at one of our guys with bad knees and our team captain got so pissed he stomped the dude in the head.The American football part is also why you fit right in here at WSB.Yeah that used to be the interpretation. You were basically treated as interfering with play unless you were lying unconscious on the pitch.“Offsides” is not and never has been a soccer/football term and makes one look like a buffoon when talking about the rule.Lmao I think it’s funny when foreigners try to shit on our great American sport; you act like you don’t have boxing and MMA in your country as well. Good parents don’t let their kids fight in boxing or mma or play football, so, it’s not really a problem for most Americans, only poor people play those sports to entertain the rest of us.

Rich peoples kids play baseball, soccer, swimming, insert noncontact sport here...are you nitpicking the fact he said “offside**s**” and not “offside”?Ahhh, you don't like the "s" because it's wrong. I'll grant you that, even if it is a colloquialism. Although to claim using it makes one look like an idiot is certainly an opinion. I'll take your critique to heart though and make sure to always say "offside" from now on.  You've made a positive difference in someone's life today, albeit by being a complete dick about it.DefinitelyThis is wsb, you want fucking concierge service?It's not a colloquialism, it's just wrong. And even 30 years ago that player would not be offside, I don't know where you're getting that from. I feel like you're thinking of the rule today where a player can't interfere with play when in an offside position, such as blocking the keeper's field of vision, but that was not the case in the clip.You're a spritely one aren't you!It’s a good research movieMargot Robbie 😍I developed my trading strategy off this movie.

You don't belong here if you don't get an erection from the speech that Scar gives as he chomps down a steak and casually lists bear markets over the past 150 years, or at least get confused nightmares and/or half-erection from what Paul Bellamy says about "fuck normal people" in the car.And Wall Street - a classic.

Sorry you didn’t like it! :(r/woosh~~but~~   becauseThis is the first meme I ever made. The format is relatively new, and I found it funny. If you've seen the exact same meme, chances are you've either seen someone repost my meme, or someone came up with an idea just like mine! :)My finance/econ major friend took this girl he had been trying to ask out for months to the movie movie when it first came out in theaters. The whole car ride over, he told her how he really loved the world of finance and he didn't see any better career option for him. Needless to say, there wasn't a second date.Slap her silly and sniff blow out her ass during the opening scene.

I’m not even the biggest fan of Margot Robbie. Looked up a candid of her and realized if I saw her in a target and she wasn’t famous I wouldn’t even double take. Very basic. 

But you, you should see a therapist lmao“At what time stamp can you see Margot Robbie completely nude?”With 3 seconds to answerIts just money SamIvan boesky that motheefuxkin Chad of a BullT-Bone was a little bitch.

Am thinking of finally watching a few finance movies: Wolf of Wall St, Margin Call, and Barbarians at the Gate.

Long overdue. Gotta catchup.What do you young retards know about ludes? wacthing movies? Like the good coke, ludes (the real 714 pharmaceutical ones)  were in the 80's way before you escaped your dad's sac and the bathtub drain and hung on long enough for your dad to meet your mom.KEVIN!!Lul it's SO easy to tell from 1 comment*Simp detected*The one with her and will Smith was pretty good tooDont stop simpin'No fair, some of us are 🌈🐻![Fantastic scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtFyP0qy9XU) (starts at 0:45)

Also, here's [Paul Bellamy's speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjbRz6pI7KU) about how Wall St has the fingers on the scales (starts at 1:00)I was working for a small CPA firm in the late 80's. We were at a management company in the Detroit area that day. 

One of the managing partners gets a phone call. He wants to know who it is. 

"Ivan Boesky."

He took the call.It's hard with one hand ya knowDon’t forget about “The Big Short”. My personal favorite as a gay bear.It's one of the best pieces of cinema I've watched. Don't expect a life-changer but   you literally can't (and won't want to) take your eyes off itBoiler room is quite good as well. RecommendedAll these Wall Street movies getting name-dropped beneath this post and nobody’s mentioned peak eighties boomer stonks melodrama WALL STREET?

The sequel is alright, too.Wolf of Wall Street is a cinematic masterpiece. It is my all-time favorite movie as well as my go-to for first dates. 
(If she doesn’t REALLY like the movie, we aren’t compatible and there won’t be a second date lol)Watch Boiler Room. Just sayin, it’s great, has good drama, and is based on marketing and selling stocks and the MC’s relationshipsNot sure if it’s as educational as the others but I also enjoyed “the boiler room.” And I want to say that that movie was inspired by Jordan Belfort of Wolf of Wall Street as well.You should read barbarians at the gates. I picked it up a week agoYea the big Short is key and actually teaches you how/why the great recession happened.Margin call I like. Also too big to fail#Inside Job 2010
Sorry I'm a 🌈🐻Its an amazing movie. Just don't think you're going to be watching a low brow film about "stock boy does what he wants and dont afraid of nobody". Its a much deeper movie than that. First realize that its Scorsese so you are in fact watching a traditional gangster movie. You don't realize that you're watching a gangster movie because they aren't literally a gang. But at its core you like Jordan because you are vicariously living the fantasy of being untouchable by the law. This fantasy is exactly the recipe of a gangster movie. Keep in mind that the details don't really change what type of movie it is when Jordan tells you that he won't bore you explaining the IPO scam. Second, be sure to notice the lack of line between the prestige of Wall St and the vulgarity of the shirtless petty criminal in a Long Island parking lot. Part of the movies point is that there isn't really a difference between the hustle society looks up to and the hustle society looks down on. Third, realize that you are watching a movie about addiction. Not just drug addiction, or even money addiction, but an addiction to a sort of power and feeling of being untouchable. Part of the point of the film is that there isn't really a difference between the addicts society looks up to and the addicts society looks down on. In the scene where Jordan is fighting with Naomi while on ludes, change the setting in your head from a million dollar home to the projects. With this one trick suddenly the scene becomes a deeply uncomfortable glimpse of poverty. Fourth, the movie is a love letter to New York. See if you can spot the scene with the twin towers.Trading Places, add it to your list.It’s epicThe big shortBoiler room sucked but still watch itYou should watch The Big short and if you like reading Boomerang by Micheal Lewis is really good. The part about Norway inflating their bank system reminds me of wsb lol
Edit:dude already mentioned the big short so I will add another movie : "Floored" its a documentary on YouTubeRogue TraderTrading places is one of the best movies of all time. Highly recommendMargin Call... the rest are kids moviesYes, but watch the original made for cinema version and not the director's cut.  In my opinion the director's cut drags on quite a bit and doesn't add much to the movie; the cadence of the original is far better.Boiler Room alsoBoiler RoomOk boomerI just downvoted your comment.

FAQ

What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

•	⁠Rudeness towards other Redditors, •	⁠Spreading incorrect information, •	⁠Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.

Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.I said she was basic that’s not simping. Simping is post a girl on a skinny with abs subreddit.

Before I do,  can someone tell me why he didn't just...cash out( wrong words)  at the peak there?  Can you do that?How are you smart enough to land a 10 bagger, but too retarded to take profit? What the fuck were you waiting for?

I know exactly what went through his head, because it was the same thing i went through when I first started doing this a couple years ago. I was a gay bull always "BTFD". you learn when you stop panicking and start taking losses to the chin and find the next play that makes sense. Used to make smart investments, then I found a trading guru that taught me how to buy high and sell low. That was my tuition I paid to the market.This guy Tax'sI am 100 dollars away from taking full advantage of that

Dumbass.Yes.I did this all day one day whole account 30k one trade hold for a couple mins and sell. Kept doing it over and over again until I made about 100 trades that day. Pretty sure TDA labeled me as autistic. They talked real slow on the phone when the following week came and my method failed 100 times.I would've creamed when it jumped to 20k and sold then lol.Was most likely a retard following wsbgod fake accounts thinking his 1k was gonna turn in 100000000000 if he held another week. 

Actually it’s unexplainable. Nigga you’re up 50k on 1k gtfoHe’s obviously super gay and retardedOne of us one of usI don't think this is the dude to follow"IF" is always a big word in these situations... always have a planThat would require him to not be a gambling addict .Even if he had weak hands and sold at 50% profit(150% total) that’s still better than losing. Of course we all know that sweet Reddit karma is worth more than actual money.I can. It’s what if it goes to 100x or 1000x.Greed.[Seriously](https://i.imgur.com/NwiNwcl.jpg)SPYI take it as a very valuable learning experienceFast?

Thanks for helping me out!)Looks like he started with 5k, made that into 52k, and then made that into 72 bucksGrindr for iOSCause he probably is a gay bear (bet against the stock aka bought puts or a put spread of some kind) and thinks the market is finally crashing so why take the money out today since a market crash takes weeks? Obviously this didn't happen. Now if you're asking why he didn't cash out while he saw his gains going down, well that's probably because he thought that's just a little resistance before the storm,and pbb all kinds of bias confirmation mechanics that are stuck to the brain of every retard gambler here, just like me and pbb like you if you'll get into it. The funniest part is that you read this and thi k that you would've pulled out, until it's your time to do the exact thing and you start rationalizing the behaviour, then it all makes sense, but at least you'll get karma whem u post it here.If you don't know, don't bother... 

*Actually* it's a fun little game called Robinhood. Have fun, Tiger! Also, I'd recommend starting out with options1x? Gtfo that’s retarded. If I was worried about my $20 life savings I wouldn’t have bought uso calls with it. 20g or bust baby!If thats the „usual“ case, youre doing everything right, there is a good rule of thumb for every trader out there. If you have made 5 times the money you risked (5 times the difference of your stop loss to your total wager) you take profit and do not care if the damn thing could have given you a million % of your initial sum. If you do that once a week you are a rich man in no time.Thismy 2018 taxes got me a fatty 8k returnWell he wasn’t even close to a small loan of a million dollars

r/kowalski_memesThat's exactly how I lost my $1200 Trump bucks. Should've followed the unironic advice and inversed this sub.I only trade stonks because I’m a pussy... but I can confirm that’s not true. My account was almost vertical for a while then one day I figured why make $500 a day when I can make $50000 and yeah let’s just say it was vertical the other direction. 🤔🔫I turned 5k into around 35k with spy and casino puts before the reversal started turning my tendies to ash. I managed to bail out at 50% down from my peak.  Have since clawed my way back to around 70% of that initial peak.SameBless your little cotton socks... Ha ha ha...

How tf do you let all that money fall right from your hands lolI would've sold after being up a grand. A bird in the hand is better than two in the bush lolIt’s different when you’ve actually been in that position multiple times. I have no emotion in gains. Only on losses.Or what if you become the Federal Reserve in one trade?If I'm at 2x I'm taking half out at least, much less fucking 10xHow did this happen? Lots of leverage? Options?You seem to have made money during the severe bear market, but suffered due to the federal reserve stimulus package. 



You only made money when it was a free-market. This is a common mistake of bears, they only made bank between Feb 21-March 23Holy shit, that is crazy!Thanks bossYou got $20?1x =/= 100% gain$20? Gtfo retard. Just apply for 5 credit cards with $1,000 limit each. Then use margin to 2x. That’s $10,000 capital for you. Then yolo that and have a million. I guess you’re too stupid to understand how it work so I just explained it to youThis sub is too big now. It's filled with people who have never and will never trade actual money. All the real traders and analysts have left to their next hidey-hole sub or have just stopped posting.I don't think most of the people saying there's gonna be a rug pull actually trade. Just the armchair commentators always preaching doom because doom is more interesting than what stocks normally do. Go up.Are you me? Seriously lost my trump bux the same way!

Just getting into this tendie shit now at the worst timeHe forgot the - before it. -20$It does when you’re gamblingThank you kind autistThat's easy to say in hindsight, but there was no real logical market reason for the crash to stop. It only did because jpow shoved a ton of monopoly dollars into the market to stymie the bleeding.

The question at the time was "who is more powerful: jpow, or the economic reality of the situation?" - a valid question with a non-obvious answer.It seems there's always this sentiment after a big crash.. in 2009 lots of people were posting about the next drop already and saying it was 'soon' and stay out of the market.. etc. 

They don't realize it needs time to sneak up on you.. it hits you when you don't expect it.  I mean, was anyone really posting about a dip in January for the next few months?So long as I can bring my wife and her boyfriendAre you ancients autists, and have I come at last to the realm of the Spirit of Deep Out of the Money Options?He can pull out whenever he wants.

The thing is, the kind of person that turns $500 into $50,000 without ever taking his profits is the kind of person dumb enough to then lose it all and turn it into nothing. 

A smart person would have never hit $50,000. They would have taken their earnings long before that.Yeah sorry. I was being sarcastic.

Speaking from very personal experience of being in op's position (my graph looks just like his but my peak was at 150k), you begin to believe your own bullshit once you've made it that far. In my case, and I dare say op's, I completely underestimated the effect of the fed pump and overestimated how rational the market would act.

Futures contracts are most often settled by physical settlement or cash settlement.”Can you summarize this for us in a few words?Tesla is a good one, along with apple and amazon.Of course just overcook the tendies and then eat them duhI mean I wish I bought eri (now czr) at 7 with my entire portfolio but hindsight is 2020I think he meant -20gIt should've never crashed. Shutting down over a virus is just retarded liberial participation trophy pussy shit. Ots cause people think you can stop a virus by hiding. It just waits and still gonna get who it gets as soon as we start living again. Texas had 300 cases a day in march then shutdown stayed steady opened and 1000s a day now. Its mother fucking nature people qe can't stop it only hope to survive it. Again in the large picture 150k out or 350million isn't a bad #  even if it doubles before this passes 300k isn't shit in the population. In the same time 600k from cancer another 500k from other reasons. Over 1 million people die in america yearly. And more are born.  Look up 2009 1958 1968 1919. 2 flu seasons and pandemic over then all of em are still around and people catch spanosh flu now  mother nature. Laws of nature. Only the strong survive. Now drop your cocks and grab your socksGotta cuddle for warmth right?
( I c this as a route for you to grow more so ) 

Market is predictable -> market is completely bull shit -> market is not rational as i thot ( you are here ) -> market is starting to make sense ( coming towards here ) -> market is predictable (  1st stage tho now consciously more skill  involv'd   )   ->  market is predictable enough for safe plays with ( precise ) expect'd profit of +% over time ( i'm not here yet )

this is the route i c , i think you're well on you're way to ' market is starting to make sense ' cos yo are making steady profit over time ( around this time is when people learn not to fight the trend lol )> I'm a ~~retarded~~ lazy

ftfyTo answer your question: Yes.You named 3 companies. Not 3 people.I was sure on that one though since they have very good IP with a good monetization system but i let myself be talked out of it. Instead I let my savings sit in a low apr money market while i house hunted for way too long instead of almost doubling my money in that time. It made me get a hunger for it though so here I am lol. What companies are you playing with or watching out for these days?> It should've never crashed. Shutting down over a virus is just retarded liberial participation trophy pussy shit

The airlines absolutely should have, and did - containing a pandemic isn't "retarded liberal participation trophy pussy shit", quarantine and monitoring and reducing travel are literally the _opposite_ of "retarded" here.

(and if you want to complain about "participation trophy shit", how about those losers whining about their loser statues being taken down, huh?)

> Ots cause people think you can stop a virus by hiding

No, you stop it by containing it and minimizing the spread.

Remember the big Ebola scare when Obama was president? Like, 2 people died to that in the US, and they were the people who brought it in the first place. Why? Because of quarantine and contact tracing. It was eradicated in the US _because nobody else got it_.

> Over 1 million people die in america yearly

This is the dumbest argument, really - you realize these are cumulative, right? Like, all the people comparing it to the flu's 60k or whatever apparently think only the bigger number counts. No, it's _in addition to_. 300k isn't nothing "because 600k died from cancer", that's 900k between them.Essentially anyone that invested low and sold highI went theta, czr is my main play these days. A smattering in spacs, and then I still got some dkng, some oil plays that I intend to hold until recovery, some dis, wheeling the cruise lines, and then a decent chunk in various reits to hold until recoveryAgain rocket boy.  If 300k die cumulatively in the 2 flu seasons then its a small drop in a big pond fool. 300k of 350million still less then 1% of our population. Your never gonna contain it idiot it spreads to easy.A little snowflake like you. I'd mash your whole face cause I'm sure your a little bitchWall Street brokers hate this guy 👆, click here and learn this simple trick to make money out of the stock marketSomebody was on the other side of those trades, so it wasn't really "working" for anyone. It was a 50/50 shot.

To me this convo is basically like a one guy at the casino saying to another guy "it sickens me that some people made money going all in on one hand of poker while I played every slot machine in the casino and just ended up down 5%".

The guy who went all in on one hand of poker isn't a role model, just a gambler with a different strategy and risk tolerance. Odds are that strategy would have gone the other way 95 times out of 100.Stay mad bird brain lmaoYep it never happens to anyone!So there’s a 5% chance. I like those oddsexcuse me Einstein, but your sound logic (from the 'citation needed' to current) is wasted on a guy who referred to tesla amazon and apple as people.Damn it, you're right.Sure let me just pull 3 random people out of thin air that I don’t have any connections to? There are tons of people that bought $300 tesla stock for it to go to 1600~

How is that not an exampleThere are an equal number who sold at 300 and watched it go to 1600. Aka gambling. Did you not read my post?Maybe I’m just not understanding you, but the comment you initially replied to was saying dumping all your eggs into one basket works for some people, and you asked for a citation. 

It wasn’t a “citation” but those 3 companies I listed had major increases in the past few months which is why I said what I said. I don’t know anyone personally.The three companies had major increases, but the implication is that some people were invested solely in leveraged assets in those companies and only those companies, thus making lots of money in a short time.

I doubt those people exist. Sure, you have people on here dumping money into short term Wall St. Bets, but almost nobody doesn't have most of their money in 401ks and IRAs. If you're making "big" bets, you almost certainly have a trust fund to fall back on, and you're almost certainly going to need to fall back on it in short order if you have a gambling problem.

Case in point - we know today that dumping all your money into apple in 2000 was a great idea. But nobody did that. Everybody was diversified. Nobody put all their eggs in that basket.

Do you believe people did go all in on AAPL in 2000? _**Citation needed**_This fucking hurt🤣.  The fact that for a moment I actually expected the 2nd trooper to hit is why I'm in this sub ❤.Exactly how it felt...but I wanna see some YOLO's on earnings this week, no punkass theta gang bullshit anymore!!!!Saw both my put and my call get taken out, nicePerfect reenactment of this sub over the last two weeks.It’s the helmetsFinancial autism should be an actual disease after this month.Who remembers that Giant TSLA strangle that was purchased a week or two ago? He banking harddNiceThis is the wayWhat’s the original clip from ?#Exceptionallygreat

You mean u/Grumpy-jamesThe week of Jar Jar's Tesla 7/17 2500c

7/13: " Ooh! Ooh! Mooie! Whoo-Hoo! Aah!"

7/14: "Dis is nutsen. Mesa tink we goen back now!" 

7/15-7/16:  "Yee gods! Whata mesa sayin? Wesa dyin' here."

7/17:  "Thisa one big mess. Weesa going nowhere!"Poetry.Aaaaand ... it’s gone !Fun fact. many of the backgrounds and effects were not done on green screen, but a giant led wall using the unreal engine.With earnings this week 7/24 will hopefully be much differentI sold 3 iron condors on Friday morning with break evens at 1460 and 1520. Max profit of $3.4k max loss of 1.7k. Took profit when they hit around $2kI’m infuck me and my tesla calls from last week. stock didnt move at all and we're all stuck in this shithole :|can't wait for the loss porn. don't think I've been this excited for earnings in a long time.!Remindme 2 daysI sold at 9 40 this morningTSLA will be above $2000 by FridayTheta gang bitch!It sounds like he's shaking a spray canThe only gains winner is daddy musk sitting on 75billionThe disappointing head-shake kills me!I don't get itThis is the way.Elon Musk - gamble on yr boyThanks to whoever wrote this scene for making me fear the bad guys even lessTheta gang hitsI thought this was going to be the scene where they punched the child. Thank god, I can't take seeing that again.As an aside, this was such a great scene as a call back/explanation of all the terrible marksmanship through all the previous movies by storm troopers.You were right about one thing Master. The negotiations were short.Wait untill battery dayImo, best bit of the Mandalorian, after all the shots missed by the first trooper everyone would have bet the house on the second trooper hitting the thing.I mean... They're imperial scouts, they're the even more derpy version of storm troopers.After failing on calls 3 times now, I will never play TSLA again. I don’t know how u autists time the jumps. I was following a falling wedge all week that never produced shit. These were calls FML💪🏽💪🏽This is the wayI feel personally attacked.Fuck Elon if the whole Jonny depp thing is true.Sell NOW if held!this guy is making bank todayHere before 2K upvotesMe too. I expected him to nail it on first shotI've seen this scene more than once in the mandalorian and I was still expecting Trooper 2 to hit 😅How does $50k on tesla calls sounds?Theta gang is awesome, but I'll always leave aside money for a good FD or for scalping spy on volatile days. Money in this account is so disconnected from my reality, but I still can't imagine throwing 50 grand into buying options> punk ass-theta gang bullshit

Brilliant show.I just cameI have 200k riding on tesla calls atmSome interesting things happened late Friday afternoon with option flow to consider:

1. At 3:25pm a $379k order placed for 8/7 $2300c 

2. At 3:53pm a $372k order placed for 7/31  $2150c

3. No corresponding put flow activity. In fact, no large put flow placed at all for next week on Friday.

4. But here is the one that makes you stop drooling with crayons and pay attention—

At 3:35pm an order was placed for deep ITM 1/15/21 500c.......for $15.3M.Sounds like a Chad, but maybe a cuck after that.hey brother, if you want into the ass-theta gang just let me know, the circle jerks are on Tuesday and Friday nightsThus WSB has died,  might as well delete this subredditPUTS!?! PUTS!?! What kinda pansy anti-American bullspit is this, sounds like a cuckoldGYNAIt was good s1, were they aiming for that thing in the cornerBest episode of the show by far in my opinionI did, that's why I thought he surely wouldn't miss again this time.NyetWhat show is this from?NoKind of,  the way the blaster rattles when he shakes it shows more of a couple of faulty blasters, low quality,  since this takes place after endor before the rise of the FO.Pic or banthis is going to hurt...Hahaha 7/24 expiration haha you are a High Roller Gambler! Extremely risky move!! Make sure to Sell before it goes worthless! $200K down the drain to $0 real quick! Move that shit further out January 2021 or further, BUY TIME, you can still make big money when it goes up and you have TIME on your side versus against you, which in this position, Time is against you and your worst enemy! Goodluck! Make sure to pull out before it goes worthless is my best advice! Even if it’s eating the $22K loss.You using flowalgo to capture these?Damn, deep ITM trades are where the big boys play... 

That's 150x @ ~$1010-1017 each depending...

That's a solid fucking swing trade. Delta of damn near .96, B/E of ~$1518 

So deep ITM, it's practically OTM. Any movement to the upside prints... and likely, this is just one leg. 

I wonder what the whole position looks like...probably sold calls and used 2302150c to create spreadsNah b its my safety net for my FDs tbhOr just short the market if PUTS aren’t your thing.Yes...the joke is that stormtroopers have terrible aimI mean the whole show is pretty great but giving the stormtroopers some personality was amazing. Just fucking punching baby Yoda in the face.НекогдаThe Mandalorian .. considering there's a bunch of DIS investors in here, I'm disappointed!thats the "in-universe explanation" but the joke is obv about a highly trained and feared military force having inexplicably bad aim in the movies[proof](https://imgur.com/gallery/xwTJV6a)How are you alivei am waiting for the first 10 minutes of the morning.   Thats really were i hope to make my moneyI am nowt going to eat the 22k loss, we re at 2 hours before open and tesla at 1520 [and rising](https://imgur.com/gallery/ksa1E6b)Yeah where does this info come from?YAHTZEE! He's back my brother's, thought we lost him!! You'll be printing money in no time!!Ya i totally enjoyed the show. I didn't love the middle 3 episodes that had no plot advancement at all. But this episode just stood out so much for me as so phenomenal."investors" lolHoly shit dis puts, no one subscribes to that shitThis is the way.Can you call yourself investor when you buy calls?I bought it for Q1 earnings since I had calls, and forget to cancel it every week. I still have it and I’ve watched the Simpsons maybe twice on it.. each subscriber counts though, I did my part.Movies are TV shows now?Motherf-

Godspeed.Oh ur fucked lmao💪💪💪 godspeed you autist.Best of luck retard may the tendies forever be in your favorCongratsYou bastard, it’s already 1650
I stg you fuck this up I’m gonna screamWell did you sell this morning?May the gods be with you.At least your strike is ATM so you do have a chance if it goes to $1,600 you can profit pretty nice! And don’t expect earnings to be great as well! Look what happened to Netflix!Did you hold or sell? Please tell me you held?The Illuminati.

aka 'Robinhood Gold'STOCKS ONLY GO UPTrue. I think whenever they release the second season those characters and that story will come into play. The writers and directors seem to pack everything with references so who knows.Yeah, the IRS would like a word with him, regarding his use of ‘investors’. 
(Tax code is pretty tight regarding when you can use ‘trader’ vs ‘investor’)I just watched 1950s Treasure Island on it yesterday.I’m not really a Star Wars fan but Mandalorian is pretty good. 

Much better than I expected.This is the way.Huh? Are you high? Or just daft?yes. 10 part near movie quality series.  where are you from?  is the internet connection strong enough in the falklands to bet option spreads on tqqq?Thanks i ll need itearnings are up - monday morning will make me whole even a profitpossiblythank you sir :)Doubled my money this weekSold yesterday made a shit ton of money on tesla yesterday and todayWhat would be nice is for Monday to open green even a 1 percent stock move would make this 22k loss feel profitable. 

The other thing is that we could always hope for a move up to 1600 where i make out like a bandit.Dudes got $200k riding on it, you think he doesn't know this shit?I held for most of the day. Was down -40k then it turned. Took 50k in profits and sold. 

I have been scalping since and back in the calls-SIDE-DOWNStonks only go upDIS is the way.Maybe. Is there really a Mandalorian TV show?Fireworks just went off in my head.

I remembered it as a movie. I guess that’s what binge watching does to my memory.

I’m going to go watch it again now. Thanks.Holy fuck why don’t you just buy a few contracts for January or next year? That way you’re guaranteed to make moneyEven if it drops after earnings the run up will make him money due to hype volume and increased premiums.!RemindMe 2 days!Remindme 2 daysRemindMe! 2 days!RemindMe 2 daysRemind me! 2 days!RemindMe 2 days!RemindMe 2 daysRemindMe! 2 days!RemindMe 2 days!RemindMe 2 days!RemindMe 2 daysremind me! 2 days!Remindme 2 daysDieYou sell? It’s going back down.Great job!This is the year 2020. Over the past several years Disney bought the Starwars franchise, made a bunch of Starwars movies and started a streaming service for the purpose of releasing a Starwars TV show. 

Yes, it is.Is there a Mandalorian movie?Is there a Mandalorian movie?i am still forming a strategy,  i  so you could say i am thinking of some longer term puts.    I have been averaging between 5-7% growth on scalping the movements on Tesla every day last week.

The secret of the Cold War is even though both the U.S. and Soviets had advanced mechanized armies, neither had the balls to go into a full conventional war with the Chinese due to sheer numbers. The same thing happened during the Soviet-Chinese border crisis in 1969--they decided they just didn't have the manpower to beat China in a conventional war and gave up.Nah it was a tieIt was a muted victory with US withdrawl, but they'll never financially recover from this.Wait I thought they were the VietlongJpow: "oh ok flaming dragon, fuckface, why dont you take a step back, and literally FUCK ALL YOUR PUTS"Has this been meme’d here yet?

Jpow as Tom cruise.https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/bush-mission-accomplished-2003-iraq-trump-coronavirus-AP_03050109208-crop.jpgGANGThe gains are real though.  If we lose but get a lambo is it really defeat?The “textbook” in my high school US history class was literally Howard Zinn. This was almost two decades ago and it’s not like things have gone in the other direction since.I think that'll only  work  if you've seen the movie, with the amount of commenters asking what movie this is , is a reminder of the fact that  wsb have much zoomer demographics and non us resident retards. That's why you see so many spongebob wsb memes, hence  I'm here to introduce meme diversity. I tried high context memes, it doesn't work as well here.Even anime fucking ripoff of that scene came with Ride of the Valkyries. WTFApocalypse Gay is just a worse version of Heart of Darkness.  And I'm pretty sure there were infinitely more tendies in the Congo than riceland.Double negative equals a positive. 📈📈📈I mean if baba J pow pulls out- same ending reallySounds rightI came to the comments for this answer as well and then saw that some retard /u/Older_Miggy answered finding Nemo. Lesson learned : don't read wsb comments with the intent of finding correct answers.

Up vote for MiggyIt is.where have you seen that the fed is going to buy stocks? i've heard rumors, but i haven't heard that the fed has committed to buying stocksu/vredditdownloaderI was talking about the movie, look at those fucking helicopters!ThanksDude. Where the fuck have you been? We’ve been firing our 40MM powellizter cannons at the vier shorts all day. Just look at TSLA.I hope that links you to malwareOn Sunday Trump called them "beautiful wars"All your comments are about Americans... 
😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎Soviet Union won WW2. US came along for the rideMotherfucker, I can go to Hanoi get a Starbucks a BigMac and some me short you long time for dessert. Tell me again how we didn’t “win”.Didn't the Vietnamese turn around and went to war with China right after? Politics is funny everywhere.It might be just me, but it seems that you are talking about the Korean War instead of the Vietnam War the OP is addressing.This post is gay.

&#x200B;

I too am gay but this post is just unacceptable.Careful- you’ll get downvoted for treading too far into reality! Just nape the fuckers and rock out to the CCR!We are talking about the Vietnam WarOh man that movie could have dozens of golden memes come from it.Sacrifice grandma for a lambo?

Hell yeathe gains *for you* are real.Apocalypse Now memes always work.  Keep up the good stuffThat's a valid pointI think it would've the contrast btwn the song and reality would've worked quite well here too. Still glad to see this movie in a meme.Pls keep them coming, literally my life depends on these kinda memes.catering to zoomers? fk off with thatCan you link to a version with the original song tho? For conspiraciónYeah but Gate was a cool showThis is wrong and gayyou're right it's still opinion/rumor, but imho it looks good enough to buy the rumor, sell the news.

Edit : not my puts just puts in general.. ;)Yeah but he immediately followed up the next sentence saying they were horrible wars. It was clear he meant they were fought beautifully by our military.I’m trapped amongst these hogs, so I spend a lot of time thinking about themThe old saying is WWII was won with British intelligence, American steel, and Soviet blood.

The USA played a significant role is WWII, but the idea that it beat the Nazis is over exaggerated. The eastern front dwarfed the western front in troop numbers and importance to the European theater.Get outta here with that commie shit. Who ended Japanese resistance? Hiroshima and Nagasaki ring any bells? What about the whole western theater you dingus. Its not like we just froliced up the beaches of Normandy or up through Italy. Get out with your revisionist historyHere’s a good starting point, the end: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_SaigonAfter beating the Americans they thought they should try with a harder enemy - the Chinese. And they managed to fight the Chinese to a draw which is pretty creditable.There were 320,000 PLA troops in Vietnam. This is why the U.S. never invaded. Because they didn't want a repeat of Korea.Right, the 320,000 PLA troops in Vietnam were a tripwire the U.S. didn't want to cross because of its experience in the Korean War.Grandma had a good run but the future is now old lady.https://youtu.be/hn37QfXw1-E

Let me know which one u prefer, for future patriotic memes.gotcha. that's what i thought. with markets where they are, i don't think i see them buying stocks unless we retest march lows.Also the wall was a metaphorDon’t know why you are getting downvoted. It was obvious that’s what he meant as well. Our other choice isnt any better imo still. They both are puppets following their puppet masters.It's a shame he barely speaks in proper sentences so we don't have to interpret what he might be getting at like we do with a three year old.Don't make excuses for his stupidity.  What war is beautifulexceeeeeppppppppt, if it wasnt for the giant russian landmass and hitlers dumbass trying to go that way, wed be speaking german.

&#x200B;

we also got our shit pushed in in the pacific, the A-bombs were everythingLike physically or in the internet??cant invade the giant vast cold shitty land that is russia>Who ended Japanese resistance? 

[Anti-anime activist Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria)Japan had no plans to surrender even after Hiroshima and Nagasaki - More people had died in the firebombing air raids of Tokyo than in Hiroshima or Nagasaki. But when the Soviets took out the kwangtung Army in 3 days , the Japanese knew the writing was on the wallThe Western front was where if you had fought bravely and needed some time to recuperate, the German Army sent you. It was a cakewalk compared to the East.though the chinese during that time just came off maos terrible policies that fucked china hard so the army was shit quality, not the korean war era elite quality whereas the viets had experience against americans and had home field advantage. So i wouldn't consider china to be a harder enemyBut the US did fight in Vietnam. I am confused.Unlike Korea, by the time Vietnam happened China had nukesI prefer the original, I wanted to see the difference in the meme, the song may not have worked.People just don’t like unbiased facts that are unaligned with their narrative. They prefer the half truth because it confirms their bias.
>we also got our shit pushed in in the pacific, the A-bombs were everything

This part ain't accurateAttacking a puppet state is really what did them in. You're right. Decimating major cities in their mainland in an instant had nothing to do with it whatever. Totally reasonable.>Japan had no plans to surrender even after Hiroshima and Nagasaki

What are you blathering about?

August 6th, 80,000 dead. August 9th, 40,000 dead. August 15th the emperor announced unconditional surrender "citing the devastating power of a 'new and most cruel bomb.' "they still believe they never surrendered because the emperor only initialed the treaty not signed itYeah it gets really tiring mowing down Russians who don't even have weapons.There army is still shitIn south Vietnam , only to try and remove northern Vietnamese fightersHe means invade the North, We sent troops to the South, but never attempted to invade North Vietnam.Imagine trying to call people out for not liking unbiased facts, when I directly quoted the president from a full statement he made, in an interview where the man flat out lied or denied every SINGLE piece of data from "unbiased facts" that was presented to him.Checkmate libtardsbruh we did for a whilllllle, there was a point obviously where the whole axis powers in general were crumbling and Japan followed suit. Almost as bad as we got embarrassed in Vietnam, another thing we dont talk aboutCorrectThe Japanese modernization had been patterned on the British one. They were great fans of England and completely believed in Churchillian credos - We shall fight in the beaches, we shall fight in the streets, we shall fight in the fields. We shall never surrender.
Whether you get called brave or fanatic just depends on whether you win or loseTheirAh, got it.Ah, I get what you mean. The did bomb the crap out of the north, though.They were doing **so well** that they started flying their aircraft into our ships while still aboard out of sheer desperation.What are you smoking?

August 6th, 80,000 dead. August 9th, 40,000 dead. August 15th the emperor announced unconditional surrender "citing the devastating power of a 'new and most cruel bomb.' "Until they delivered the unconditional surrenderYeah we dropped more munitions on the North than we did on Europe on WW2.  It was a crazy war.thats how they started the war, wiped out an entire military base, it was literally part of their culture foreverThe role to which the Soviet invasion (and the bombings) played in the surrender is a topic of continued historical debate. There had been some hope in the Japanese government that a surrender agreement could be worked with the allies by going through the Soviets, and therefore avoiding an unconditional surrender and dismantling of the Japanese empire. It's possible that, had this diplomatic avenue remained open, Japan might have held out longer in hopes of achieving this goal. Wasn't trying to make any nuanced point or anything though you dumb fucking bitches just get offended by stupid jokes really easily.unfortunately we didn't drop the only bombs that matter thoughGuys, I'm not taking any sides, but just FYI

this meme needed to be resubmitted and reedited 9 times to make it past the mods, any more discussion in that direction will probably get me and my future memes banned from wsb.I already claimed him as my daddy, btfoCongrats and fuck you!For the love of god secure your profits and celebrate these amazing gainsThank Intel for its incompetence.took me awhile to realize this was not an option play...Did you just made 1.2 million because Intel shit the bed?

Anyway, it's good progress!Enjoy your cocaine and possibly borderline underage hookers😄😄😄Cash outI was waiting for someone to post AMD gains. Well done. I thought about buying some in-case INTC launched but I'm 0/4 this ER week so I sat this one out. Didn't expect them to throw in the towel to AMD. Congrats.Remember me?

Loading up on LEAPS after earnings.Can you tell me what image editing software you used there, that looks a reeel professional job.

Oh BTW Confuckulations!Chad.AMD's performance today literally vindicated the old saying of doing the exact OPPOSITE of r/wsb.

Someone was saying to buy puts when AMD is at $58 and calls when its at $52. If you ain't long for mommy AMD you don't deserve gainshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdfeXqHFmPI&t=1sWhat we are all trying to do.  Congrats manFuckin A....good shitI hate you, and I hope you know thatExit a majority of your position and start selling covered calls weeklyWhen did you buy these?

Also happy for you even if I'm on the INTC side. Took a ding this week, but still up massively on it as an investment. Wondering if I should pick up on some or wait for it to go lower.Same boat, are you gonna sell? Or wait until earnings?Me, being the clown I am, decided to sell some 1 day expiry calls at 65 when AMD looked to be closing below 60 yesterday.  This morning had to roll my 1 day sales a month out since AMD is shooting up like a rocket and I don't want to lose my shares.

Hopefully there's a crash in a month or so or I might have to roll them again.cant believe FOMOing AMD this morning already pushed 47%Money really do make moneyYou’ve gained another $75k, well done...fuck youshould be thanking intc. if they didn't shit the bed as much as they did with guidance, amd wouldn't have moved much.nice I remember looking at AMD at around 2 dollars a share, never pulled the trigger thoughWow, putting a quarter million into a single tech stock! Okay but now what you do is take all the profits and put it into a 1% interest savings account until you die. That’s the sort of thing that got you here in the first place right?Ngl, you could get me back in the game with a small donationFUCK YOU! congratsCongratulations and you can put that chip up ur assWould NIO be like AMD going to 69 in 4 years?You stole my tendiesI'll be your sugar baby! My body is ready!Congrats on the 5 year hold, and fuck you. 

I too have AMD average cost $12.  Just didn’t have 250k to throw down when I was 23....Good for you my dude!!! I envy yaa! Da Da!??Fucking old manshares? what's thatimagine if u had callsYeah thats cool but my buddy got in at 6.77...for 5 shares. And I ignored him on it completely so...

We were in high school/early college at the timeSir...you must be a professional. This is a casino.If I can end this week - a pretty solid week already - with a huge green hulk dick I’d be soooo happyr/ayyMDI see green numbers, that’s good I assume?Thank intcFellow td user 🤣Intel is still worth 214B vs AMDs 80B. And AMD is clearly dominating the market.Thank me for selling all my shares on Monday.I used to own 2500 at 2 bucks and sold at 13. Felt like a Chad. Then felt like a retard and FOMO’ed in at 52 for Lisa su (I’ll never let you go baby. I’m sorry for leaving)I spent 20k on weed this year. Let’s work something out? 🙌🏼🤝Literally held onto this forever at the $52 wall, and sold it at $57 right before the rocket took off. FML.AVG cost of 10.96, wow you've been holding for a whileI bought AMD 3 years ago because of this sub. Glad I held onto the OG meme stock.I closed some March 2021 calls for 110 percent profit (meager by wsb standards I kno)

When should I reenter for longer dated calls hmm..

Perhaps I should wait until ER for the volatility to die down (and the possibility of pullback)?Up yours!!!When did you buy this stock??Does this look like a game to you young man?I’m not crying, you’re crying!DadaChapeauOmg wtf amdWow. That is a lot of points!Can you buy me a Tesla?hey I am your lost son. Please call me at 1-282-Tendies. Please give me a call asap. love you dadDamn, and i thought I hit it big with my 3 calls on AMD lmaoDad?I don't get it. What option is this?You son of a bitch! Gotta love it !I'll take the extra 3000 shares from you so you can have a clean 20k. It'll make it a lot easier to look atIt’s not a gain until you sell, congratsHey son! I finally got the milk.Damn. I'm jelly.Why didn’t you tell usShares?shoulda waited for $69.69this retard hold his AMD shares thur good and bad time. 

Congrat!How the fuck do you average $10.96 per contract?!Unrealized gain. Realize most of it, pay your taxes. You will sleep betterSo glad I bought at $10/share all those years agoI wear a kilt and no underwear if you’re into that kind of thing

Socks go all the way up too =>So 4 years ago he invested $66k?  Or are these calls?grats dude. thats fuckin nutsWhen you lose it all Robinhood gives you free drinks at the barMind sharing your broader trading strategy? 


I looked through your some of your comment history and got snippets but would be curious what indicators you look out for, trade length and stuff (if you dont mind sharing)

But props on the gainzwhat app is thistight tight tightCongrats and fuck youyou are a cunt.. cunt.. cunt.. cuntinuous source of inspiration!Super jellyWtf also fuck you I am in the red consistently.Good gainzFucking loser you will have to pay so much in taxes. Fuck youI did something very similar. Only difference was I got in at $12 and am still holding my 30 shares.  So yeah, basically the same.App?Is there hope for intel? Seems like a decent buy honestly they aren't going to fail.. might be a rough year but intel will redeem I'm sure

Talk to you about amd passing 60 months ago i should've jumped in nice move man did you sell though?Good trade!Should’ve sold. Monday brings AMD back to earthMy guy invested 230kLol, fuck youi hope you sold near 70What the fuck? you can buy options with TD?Shit like this makes me very very erect.On Monday it opens down 10 and the loss porn be greatCaught this move early but sold at $61.  Like an idiotHey daddy 🍑oops must've stumbled on to /r/investingHey Doc,

I know you trade AMD mostly but do you think this is a good point to trade INTC? They still own majority market, do you see them recovering from their drop in several months?Impressive. Also fuck youDont buy amd they said, 12 dollars a share is over valued they said :*(fuck you you fellow canadian retard

oh and fuck you but like also congrats retard im proud of you ❤🍁❤Thank you Dr Lisa Su.AMD and ARRY. Selling too early those are the 2 that sting me the mostGod damn that must feel amazing
Congrats man, thats awesomeMan I had AMD calls and Facebook puts expiring today that I bought yesterday as a scalp. Made a quick 20%, had a hell I would have tripled my money on both of those.Nice. Take profit and keep holding AMD.JeeezzzzzzzzzIn at 10 dollars. I find it hard to believe, if your cock is so rocked for AMD that you didn't buy more along the way.We bought around the same price except I didn’t and still don’t have 200k laying around to put in it lolLmao @ people thinking this was all just today. This wasn't a bet, it was an investment years ago and it's just showing off the AMD AH price.

&#x200B;

Dude already had 1.37 Million yesterday you fools. Look at the avg cost fellow dunce cappers.

&#x200B;

But still.... It's a very impressing investment and damn i wish that was in my portfolio. My portfolio is full of a bunch of IOUs from Harry & Lloyd.Wtf is this portfolioFirst I was like oh you made 7k today. Big deal I made triple that today on my options....

&#x200B;

and then... I saw the overall gain. wow. congrats man for having faith in AMD and Su. Hopefully I can make those kinds of gains with AMD in the far future.You must not be one of the younger ones out here. Heavy down and then hold?? Whaaaaawow slow and steady wins the race huhi thought at first these were 23000 contracts. imagine those gainz🤣Only question I have is Did you start with $250k or did you build that up through trading ?I hate myself so much for getting out when it was stupid volatile.  Didn't have anything near this much but 1200 shares 9-13ish.  I know if I get back in, shits going to take so y'all are welcome.

FuckFucking legend.What else do you invest in?Thanks for the intel on this trade before doing it...Cost basis "252,050.64" it doesn't count if you're already rich enough to just take a 250K position and just zero fucks it for years..I lost my entire savings thanks to AMDIs this thinkorswim appI wanna be on your mailing listWatched all the green today while eating my salmon tacos.What’s the initial investment.  230k?What made you call AMD exactly? Also fuck you.I guarantee I can turn that into like $500 bucks in a few hoursIs that your IRA? What brokerage?Good god you lucky bastard. Congrats.Cash out now before I consider you a retard again.Cash out and yolo into something or ban!!!  Have we had a billionaire yet?  Seriously, awesome and FU as well!Enjoy the lambo and tendies. I had puts on AMD :DSue Bae has been the matron saint of this sub since its inceptionImagine having 250k to gamble.Imagine having $200k in AMD.Good God. Fuck you man, and fuck myself even harder for not buying AMD calls two days ago.I wish I understood WSB/Stock Market lingo. Maybe one day when I have enough money to play with like you guys.Oooooof that average cost though ...I owned AMD at $11 and sold when it hit $30. Sometimes I really hate myself.Holy shit. I thought I was good making 7kI still regret selling too soon when I bought at $9.TD Bank?Yo whatOmg stay in until it's worth nothing.Hey man go fuck yourselfI wish I had the money I do now but five years ago. I'd go all-in in AMD and Nvidia and just chill.

All the big tech companies have already seen explosive growth and there aren't any smaller companies that stand out.Wtf is this stocks? GTFO this WSB leverage derivatives only. I can fucking flex my 500 dollar account on RH with a fraction share of Tesla. But flexing a 2000% gain on a 1DTE that’s the true WSB austic hero!**I am a bot.

Got itIm your long lost son please send moneyIt would take a lot of money or balls to put in so much money. Apparently he has lot of money and 2 balls.CASH. TF. OUT!you probably bought it at around 2018
imagine if you bought it at 2016 😱Please cash out 95%. Don’t become another retard.It's all because of your privilige card 😡. Sarcasm.
Congrats and fuck you!Wow, a multi-millionaire had 200-300k laying around 5-6 years ago and put it in a stonk and didn't touch it and it went up 5X....OMG that is so impressive. 

Meanwhile you could have got Tesla $1500 puts after their earnings and those puts went from $3.50 to $120 overnight. 

Or a million other stonks that only go up in the last 6 years. Take Carvana (CVNA), went from $20 to $140 from March to July in 3 months did better than you in 6 years lmfao. 

Not impressed. 0/10.How can we know this isn't a paper trade?But can you accept anal tho?Can you cook?It is the wayThat banana guy might have something to say about that.Daddy's richhhhhNice gains! Fuck youIntel has been lying about 10nm for years. What are the odds that they're lying about 7nm too?I trade AMD intra-day on another account too.Trailing stop loss FTW.Average cost of 10.96 a share. I think they'll be okay not cashing out anytime soon.Bro StOnKs OnLy gO UpShould have bought those puts man...Honestly they deserve it for being too greedy and lazy. They really thought they can sit on their ass and take it easy and get rich from dividends and stock buybacks, and other shady manipulations. This goes out to pretty much every other large company.It's both. If AMD hadn't been killing it as hard as they have been lately, Intel's incompetence would being stinging them a lot less.More like IncelDamn, I just Googled the Intel news. Looks like Intel delayed some chipsets causing their competitors stocks to spike? I guess it pays off paying close attention to the news...But our overclocking!Is it just regular stonks? Im confusedI was looking for the exp and strike lolNot an option play = mehTook me a little too long to realize thatLike, don't get me wronng, it's cool to just buy/short shares instead of options. Half of the time, I play shares, personally.

but yeah, it's just not what I'm trying to ogle at on wsb. Slow ass long term shares play zzz (but it's actually smart because you get long terms capital gains tax n shit)They've been holding forever at an average cost of $10.96. I remember their username from the past, IIRC, he's a retired physician, they'll be fine.Nah, AMD hasn’t cost $10 in a long time. This has been years in the makingNo, AMD saw that I doubted them and sold my calls for 40% loss yesterday. They're mooning to spite me specifically /sHe is on wsb, he won't cash out till he regrets it.late 2016/early 2017 looking at the price history.   
quick DD, INTC is currently a P/E of just under 10 with a 2.5% dividend. AMD has a P/E over 165 and no dividend. INTC had more net income in the last quarter than AMD had in revenue over almost the past year. By recent stock market logic, I think that means YOLO AMDNo he has shares at a really low cost basisGood job Intel, you can't release 7nm bc you're all retarded.Don’t worry, he’s got years before Intel moves on from 14nm +++++++++++ chips and goes into 7nm to START competing with Intel

(Yes I realize Intel as a whole is still like 10x the size of AMD)loseIf you think you can retire on $1.2M then you truly are a chromosome collector.It's all crazy gamblers here. Bought some Intel stock to hold for a decade because I too like to live slightly dangerously.Can i join this sub ? Who do i talk toAMD could reach NVIDIA price levels.Intel has big problems long term. It just took them to admit it for people to realize how far behind they are. 

AMD is making drastic gains in the enterprise sector with the EPYC line.Yeah, intel is falling further behind with this generation. AMD will be on 5mm before intel reaches 7mm.Well just estimating based on avg cost he's been holding since at least 2017Nah he threw 250k into AMD years back and held. 

This is peak /investingYes but he did it long ago...It was nearly 100% of my net worth at the time.Thanks. I hope you're still holding those shares?I did retire...Um, how exactly? This dude bought $250k worth of AMD shares years ago at 10 bucks. This is an /r/investing fucking bet at best.That’s the dumbest thing I’ve seen someone say on this sub 

Now that is epicNo it’s not it’s nowhere near austistic enoughSTFU, young Anakin.Lmao buying shares years ago is a wallstreet bet?

Wtf? I hardly see how this belongs here. 

Breaking: Guy with a lot of money bought shares a long time ago, and they went up.That's a huge profit margin still it's almost as good, you need to have balls to invest in a stock worth 2 dollarsTbh that's the real wall street bet, more impressive than holding a sensible shareMy lowest was actually in the $1.80s. I day traded it all the way up to $10 and put all the profits into acquiring more shares. Ended up with 23K shares and held them since.no, he can probably make more than most of us make every year just by selling covered calls with those shares..True. But you have to start somewhere. I started in 2008 with less than 5000 dollars and a salary of 48K.  Retired in 2019.canadian td bank appFor real.No he doesn't his purchase average is like 10 dollars he bought this shit 3 years agoYes. Almost got assigned 2 weeks ago with some 56c. That would have been sad.Good for you. Gotta start somewhere. In 2008, I had less than $5K in my account and was trading 250 shares of AMD at time.Not dumb at all. This week, I sold at 59, 61.50, 62 and 67. Nothing wrong with taking some profits.LTCG my man. Tax isn't too bad.I was poor before I was rich. That, more than anything else is what drove me to work harder. Now I don't have to work anymore.\*\*Theta gang intensifies.\*\*

Edit: You could sell to open relatively safe weeklies for like $16k.  Damn, that's $800k annually.  Best way to make money is to have money...Same boat too. This is a super long hold for me. Intel cucked hard last night. Like weenie-in-hand while muttering something about maybe being pan.

Not worth trying to time a small drop on the way to $100+.I prefer goujons.Thanks. I trade AMD intra-day on another account so I am booking gains daily there.avg cost is 10. AMD share haven't been 10 for a long time, bruh. this retard buy and hold AMD thur good and bad time.I thought everybody knew?I realize an average of $2K gains daily on my primary day trading account. This isn't the position I lose sleep over.Well that got weird.Thanks. This long term hold is part of a more than 10 year thesis for me. However, AMD also has characteristics of a perfect day trading stock. Thus, I hold shares here and trade shares/options in a different account. I rarely use technicals anymore. I trade the 1-min candle and spend most of the time watching time&sales plus track SMH and 2 complementary stocks (usually MU and NVDA). The majority of my trades are intra-day. Often intra-minute.Canadian TD appDon't be jelly. Nothing stopping you from getting there too. Except for wsb, I guess.TD Canada TrustA beaten Intel still owns 90% of the market. Even at its peak of technology leadership, AMD barely hit over 20% market share. So yes, Intel will redeem. Might take a year+. And when Intel can't win, they have historically resorted to illegal trade practices.61, at the time, was an all time high. Nothing idiotic about that.I think the drop today was overdone. In a normal world, INTC should lose market share quarter over quarter for the next year. The problem is, INTC has a history of nefarious business practices that have allowed them to flourish even when their tech has lagged behind AMD. The AMD ER next week will be instructive. I predict they will beat by 0.01 and guide to upper end of guidance for the remainder of the year. Stock should go up or at least  stabilize here. But the market is bat shit right now so who knows.Ha thanks! Nice name. I just introduced my son to Street Fighter.Started with under $5K in 2008ish. Day traded AMD and used all profits to increase shares. Was moving 500 shares at that time. It took about 18 months to get over $25K and could get around the PDT rules. Then scaled up. Keep in mind this was during a surgical residency so time was fairly scarce.Chin up brother. Many other non AMD opportunities out there. Keep looking. The opportunity cost of holding AMD for the past 3 months has been immense (until today).Pretty sure AMD was one of the OG meme stocks on wsb.Hey dude. When I first moved to the USA in 2008, I couldn't afford to pay rent so I lived in a fucking cockroach infected hostel. Maybe you need a handout to get rich. Not everyone does.Do you think this tech bubble is real? We're seeing stocks like amazon gain tens of billions in value overnight. Is Amazon's valuation really billions more than it was the night before? Or are people just riding a trend that's going to harshly and quickly correct itself. Long term, like you said, tech is definitely a solid investment. Short term I think we see a correction large that's going to upset a lot of these new investors (myself included) before 2021These are long shares. I have swing shares as well.If he can't, I'll step upIs he allowed to finish?Attended culinary school 2 yearsNo praise, just fuck you and the stocks you rode in onHigh.They are not lying , they said that due to covid19 its delayed.

This was back in March.

IMHO they arent that much behind.

When Intel release i10  will that mean that AMD stocks will tonk!Can you not print like $50,000 in pretty OTM covered calls every couple weeks too??Is this account a long hold? Looks like you bought in at $10?what other tickers are you in right now for long term growth?Aaaand that’s how you most likely end up losing all your profitI turned $1000 into $10K from my 60 weeklyGlad I sold my shares a week ago....Puts for Intel earnings? You woulda been IV crushed, unless you bought far out enough or something.Intel is the new fordThey'll be back though. This isn't the first time this story has played out, problem is intel has 10x the number of employees AMD does and can pay for the top engineering talent. All we're seeing is a sleeping (greedy, lazy) giant waking and its groggy and confused but it'll get there no doubt.Yes. AMD hasn’t  been $10 for a while now.What is a stock?Literally longer than half this sub was born.I miss AMD under $10. It really wasn't that long ago.

It languish in a channel forever till market finally realize they are giving INTC a run for their money.I sold AMD back in the day for 2.1 usd. Pretty stupidI was gonna say that’s something patience paying off good for him.I bought at $6-$7 back in 2016.  Bought and sold on and off...still average cost at $12.28.  I'm fucking happy.My brother told me AMD topped out at $18 and there was no more gains to be made.I bought in at $19 a couple of years back. Best bet I've made yet.what? They were $1 in 2015 , 5 years is not a long time.Most of my regrets involve selling AMD on the way up to here.That’s the only way to play it! Hold through the peak, don’t be tempted to sell, it can go higher![deleted]Im a chromosome collector. With 1 mil I can sell enough covered calls to live super comfortably and not care about if stonks go up or downUmmm isnt that 120,000$ a year of average annual SP gains? That's a higher income than 95% of people in the world.Is GE considered a dangerous buy now?Yeah. AMD is a good investment in current times.they are slowly dominating gpu and cpu industries simultaneously.Facts. Just buy and hold and watch where it’s at in 2-3 yearsI don’t think so, NVIDIA has more going for it. Nvidia has much more in the form of Accelerrating AI / software than AMD.The EPYC gains have been anything but drastic. Are we at 10% yet?nanometerThat would be correct, I have a similar average and bought them back in 2017AMD was at 9.99 on April 20, 2018.


It’s a while either way.Let's be honest, if he had 250k to invest and hold on to up until now, I doubt this is his first million

Still, pretty insane gains, peak investing indeedMake you even more badass lol 🙈Damn. What gave you the balls to do that and what year are we talking about 16 17 18? And why did you never sell?Yes, and it has been the best investment decision of my life! Do you plan to trim your position, and do you have any price targets?Put that into a mutual fund and send me my consultation fee haha best of luck man love to see itCool. Let's see your trades bro. Here are some of mine: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ec6jrx/822mil\_of\_amd\_in\_one\_year\_average\_trade\_of\_200k/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ec6jrx/822mil_of_amd_in_one_year_average_trade_of_200k/)tiny dick energy for sureAnd yet he's holding a million and you're holding your dick.Why don't you do the same?i bought 1 million shares of mlhc at 0.0001 for the meme. how big are my balls?👁👄👁Hell yea brother, that’s gangster as fuckVery true. Hell yeah dude! Good for you!Did you keep adding to your position regularly with that sweet surgeon money?

Also what kind of surgeon?IM Residency for 3 years and then practiced for 8?> I started in 2008 with less than 5000 dollars and a salary of 48K. 

You made another comment about moving to the U.S. in 2008, were you already a physician back in your country?I know, but he could have sold calls over the years. By his average he bought at least 3-4 years ago.

I remember when AMD was $2.What is LTCG?

Also I don’t get why people who point out tax implications as a negative. It is what it is..But theta.. I soldI’m in wrong chat , I thought this was options gamblers Wall Street bets, thanks!Haha, that’s awesome! Well, then it’s a different story.Cool, that’s the sense i got from reading your posts but wasnt sure. Just curious, but how’d you manage to run this strategy when you were a surgeon? Ive been debating between trying to go swing trading vs day-trading/scalping route and feel like swing is tougher but likely fits better with work and everything since you dont have to all day. 

Especially tough if you’re running the strategy based on time & sales data since you prob cant even set up notifications for that (that i know of) and need to actually observe it all the time.Do you own any intel personally or strictly AMD? This seems more of a lotto run for AMD while they are drastically improving their technology doesn't mean they are going to leave intel in the dust. Very curious what other current plays you have.Agreed on every point. I opened on AMD about 1-2 weeks ago seeing a trend for an obvious breakout but closed last week at a 50% loss in expectation of this week's tech slide. Of course, it breaks out after I did that on pure sentiment. 

Usually chips are just a simple game of numbers of who has the best performance to cost and implementation but I just can't see AMD this far ahead without gaining significant market share. Either INTC or AMD would have to make a slight recovery/correction and stabilize.So you’re a sugar daddy AND a surgeon?What do you do? No, i don't need a handout, handjob would be nice tho. AMIRITE?!Take my buttWell...fuck. What should we tell my wife?Fuck youi11*

If they follow the pattern, the likely successor to the i9 would be the i11What about last year? when 10nm is shipping and they identified the problem, were fixing the problem, and yields were improving faster than expectations?Not 50k per 2 weeks. But yes, I sell calls.That's huge on taxes.HertzLol strange math there but okayI mean anyone who's been paying attention in the tech world knew that 7nm wasn't actually coming any time soonBought 60.5 p at 3:57pm 7/23/20 for $1.35 and sold for $10.34 at 9:56 am 7/24/20. Not much crush.Id say more like Boeing or GE

At one point they were the best, they actually invested into their engineers/workers and the company and reaped amazing rewards. But they decided its easier to be "financial institutions" and be wolves of wallstreet. 

Sad thing is, the top brass that pushed for stock buybacks and dividends still got their pump and dump to retire very very very comfortably.They can be back probably yea, we dont have enough info to guarantee anything. 

Thing is we have seen quite a few "too big to fail" giants fail.This.  Smart play is 2 year horizon boomer strategy.  Buy and hold. 

You'll still get those 2.xx% dividends while you're holding the bag.I think Intel is going to have a tough time, they will still be a whole node behind of TSM if not one and half. That's if they don't have any more setbacks on 7nm. But they have used this same line of 'no fundamental roadblocks' when they had had problems with 10nm. They used that reasoning for like 5 years and here we are today with with Intel 4 years late and only in high volume production for 1 of their 3 CPU segments(laptops). Server, the highest margin of the 3, is not getting on 10nm until 2021. That's a 5 year delay from their original target. They are using the same excuse today as they did in 2015 with 10nm. I doubt they are coming back to the complete 
 unchallenged leadership position they had for at least half a decade. For almost 10 years before AMD Ryzen, it wasn't which CPU company  you should buy from but rather, which Intel CPU you should buy.

If things go as bad as I'm making it out to be Intel will still make a fuckton of money(though a lot less then before). Even if AMD is making better chips, TSM/AMD don't have enough capacity to take most of the market. Intel will still have no problem selling chips although it will forced to just focus on lower margin markets. Until/if they catch up. 

All this also ignores ARM's movement into the desktop/server market which over time may erode both AMD and Intel. Amazon already uses some of its own ARM chips. Apple just announced its own ARM chips for the Macs. Intel is competing with some big dick companies that aren't sleeping at the wheel.Imagine buying a quarter mill in amd and watching it sit at $10 while the market steam rolls ahead...I guess he got the last laughStonks only go upSmh he took years to make that 1.2 mil, not even impressive. Come back when he can do it with weekly FDsIn terms of WSB, a week would be considered long.I wish I had the knowledge and money when the PS4 launched. I was still in high school and I remember “I bet this will be good for the future of  AMD” and it was like $3 or $4 stock.AMD will soon be 300 dollars. Lisa Su is a 300 IQ asian.Ugh god same here, I had a few hundred shares at $10 and couldn’t believe it when it finally blew past $18... sold at $30 :/lol traded it from 12-16 for what seemed like foreverI can’t believe I was trying to swing trade at $8, and never held onNot stupid, just inexperienced.AMD was my first stock that I ever purchased back in 2015, just to mess with Robinhood which was new at the time. I sold them for like a two dollar profit a few days later and cashed out because I didn't really know what I was doing and thought stocks were scary.


 [https://i.imgur.com/pI6NdYf.png](https://i.imgur.com/pI6NdYf.png)I mean if we comparing, I sold AMZN at $30 way back when.AMD was trash back then, but I still had an AMX Athlon during those days.Hindsight bias.Lmfao I held on until it got to 1.80 and sold all my shares. Fucking embarrassing.back then their products were awful, though. AMD and intel were swapped with intel just shitting all over their CPUs without even trying and people were worried AMD would go bankrupt. Took AMD almost a decade to turn things around.For gay investors maybeYeah but if you can't retire with a yacht then what's the point of living?It’s in the top 1% easily...
I read somewhere people on UK benefits were in the top 5% of world earners... when we say world you do realise half the world lives on less than a dollar a day? I think to be in the 1% of Americans it’s something like 135k?

Edit: For the U.K. it is 120k gbp so I’m not sure about america..Not this year RIP xDNext gen consoles is all AMD.Eh they are still quite behind on the GPU front compared to NVIDIA but are blowing intel out of the water on the CPU front. Almost everyone I know who is building a computer is using an AMD CPU due to their ridiculous processing power and how cheap they are but I still have yet to meet anyone who has gone AMD over NVIDIAThey're dominating the budget and consumer grade CPU industry for sure. Their high end professional grade CPUs are still better IMO but more comparable. Basically no reason to buy Intel over them unless you need 5% more performance and don't care what it costs.
It's not so black and white with GPUs though. Nvidia still dominates high end gaming and only when you get into budget/midrange does it become a fair fight. And even then, with those driver issues in the past, it's hard to recommend them to someone who doesn't have the capacity/patience to troubleshoot drivers. And although AMD is bringing new GPUs to market that will supposedly outperform current NVIDIA cards, Nvidia is doing the same, so I can only speak for what's on the market today. I'm watching this nvidia and ARM deal like a hawk tho.

TLDR: AMD dominates a large chunk of CPU market and is competitive in GPU market. It's a great stonk.> slowly dominating gpu

Jury's still out on this one. NVIDIA has an incredible lead with GPGPU on CUDA, and their actual GPUs at the high end are still ahead of the game. 

Still, AMD future potential is gigantic — don't discount how meaningful their APU work is.gpu not so much, sadly. Fuck Nvidia.Per Q1 we are not, however I do believe it was an impressive jump. Considering that they were still in the initial release of Rome and were still negotiating new cloud contracts. All things considered when you look at the server lineup, its a no brainer. Epyc runs on more cores and less power than Xeon. I expect this quarter to be above 10% given that the new hardware has been on the market long enough to be installed. 

Also they are planning to release the Epyc [Milan](https://www.google.com/amp/s/wccftech.com/amd-explosive-market-share-growth-server-notebook-segments-2019-ryzen-epyc-cpus/amp/) series later this year. 

Its only my opinion but based on what we've been installing in the field and what admins have been saying. A majority if not all new data centers are using Epyc. Firms that can afford the upgrades are doing the same. 

It's this set of info that I will be scanning come the 28th.Well fuck, that was retarded of me.Hi dad, it’s me. That prostitute  in Las Vegas wasn’t on birth control.Congrats! I have another batch of shares for swing trading. Unfortunately I trimmed too early and sold some shares at 59, 61.50, 62 and 67. Can't complain though. It's been a great run.I'm scared of index funds. I would never risk my money like that.Chad energyLong stock with dollar cost averaging... Nice safe plays good job.

How does this belong in wallstreetbets?Even the dumb redneck gets it.He’s brokeIronically, the same size as the share price.Cute name. I don't miss the smell. Surgery. 6 years. Worked for 5ish. My wife tells me I trained longer than I worked. I tell her I could go back to being an absentee father/surgeon if needed.I remember that day like it was yesterday. Then the guys in /r/investing convinced me to stay away since back then, AMD was highly leveraged and was well on it's way to bankruptcy. Then Ryzen came out.Long term capital gains. Substantially lower tax rate. Obviously dependent on local tax laws.It may be what it is but it still grossly unfair.

If you lose money in a year the IRS only lets you deduct $3000 and the rest has to be carried over to future years.  So if you lose more than say $200k in a year it'll take you the entire rest of your life to work that down to zero via deductions.   But if you make any large amount in short term gains (like options trading) you better believe they'll come after you for the full rate at whatever tax bracket you're in (which if you're making more than a million might be close to 50%).

When I said what I said above to the OP I didn't realize that was a stock play I thought it was options.u are not wrong. u are in the right chat. we should ban OP. he should post his shares gainz @ /r/investingCouldn't actively day trade while operating - I was mostly swing trading then and often relied on big moves during earnings or product launches. Once I quit my day job, I moved to intraday trading, which I think is much better suited for me. I like the idea of reliable, daily income rather than waiting for 3 weeks on a swing.Hardly a lotto run for AMD. The problem is, the stock doesn't move for months, and then does this. If it just followed the general tech market the past 3 months (see NVDA) it would have been in the mid 60s anyways. Never owned INTC but seriously considered it today. Played NIO most recently from 7 up to 12 (against my better judgement).No way dude, I called dibs!And my ax (face hole)Y’all mofos gay af!!!!I'll be saying hi to step-mom 😉Anything i say can't top this thread, fuck youYeah... I sold covered calls on amd as well. Fucking sold 7/31 62c when amd was at mid 50's last week. Can't wait to get exercised.That hurts.People gained and lost massive amounts in minutes of trades , not sure what’s your point with average cost if the stock itself self tanks , no average cost can save you no matter how small it is . One million secured is better than nothingYeah, it's been known for a while, which is why I was surprise there was such a surprise. I just wish I had thought it through and bought AMD and TSM ahead of time... maybe next earnings hehAh that's interesting... I assumed that might have gotten crushed hard. That's dopeI Never understood dividends, say you invest 10k into intel. That’s 200 bucks a year right? How is this great?I mean if you bought into Tesla at sub-100 you could have made back your entire investment simply selling a covered call on earnings this past week. And if it got exercised it was still a 1600-9000% gain over 7-10 years.  


Patience in stocks can really pay off.Hahaha same for me too! I thought i was the shit because of that.Why not both?Not inexperienced, just autist!Lol I'm basically the same. But after coming back a few years later and now I just buy expensive options and sell them for cheapMan you were here when we had the JNUG and JDST  days.FBought them in 2011. Wish I had bought a ton more, but was a broke at the time.Haha i bought an Apple computer in 1999. Even in the shop they said it was possible that Apple would not make it much longer. How it has all changed.K6-2 was my first build when I was 11.50% of the kids in this sub thought you were talking about shoewear.America is around $400k a year to be in the 1%Yes this year lol, SP is up 51% since July 24, 2015.Really? Xbox one and PS5 ?Consoles have been using AMD hardware for awhile. That's nothing new.Run an IT company and we quit spec'ing Intel processors in servers because they are ridiculously expensive and Intel came out with a stupid af processor line. Do you want a bronze, silver, or gold xeon processor? Fucking stupid. I'll sell those 24c AMD's all day.Agree. Will have to see what Big Navi brings. Now, on the CPU front, AMD has held the technology lead many times in the past, but seldom broke through the 20% market share threshold. But, this time will be different...Mostly agree with you. I just believe that AMD  mindshare at the enterprise level is not moving as fast as the DIY market. This is not the first time that AMD had the better/faster chip/cheaper. Opteron at its apex, with clear technological advantage, peaked at only 20% market share.I did not buy as many as OP, only have about 50 sharesWhen it was trading sideways between 50 and 58 in the last three months, I was kicking myself for not doing any swing trading. Now I am patting myself on the shoulder for not giving in when the urge was strong. Life can be a funny business. I did sell quarter of my Tesla position (entry at $250) at $1.5k though, and I plan to buy back at $750.Renaissance Tech Hedge Fund is killing it I’m pretty sure they have the right algorithm to make you money either way enjoy being a millionaire manWhy do you keep a ship's wheel in your pants?Nice.

They are actually bottom feeder idiotsModssssssI call flufferThey just broke, there’s a differenceDo you need a little yappy dog you bring around everywhere? You can hide m- i mean it, under all your new and expensive furs wrapped around your body, like Cruella de Vil at a mink festival.Fuck you too buddy.that’s so unlucky man wowand then do what with the money? in the end of the day you're just transferring value from one asset to another that you think is less risky, what makes you think AMD will lose value in the time range that OP has in mind?I think a lot of people feel AMD is hella overvalued, even with this news. You also have to remember the majority of artists yoloing on shit don't look into things deep enough to know what the fuck TSM isDividend invest is for when you're old and have lots of capital, generally. It's a retirement plan when you have 2 million in stock. Pull in an easy and (almost) guaranteed 50k a yearIt's not great,  but Intel will probably be worth 2x what they're at now inside 2 years. 

They're behind AMD now,  but they're pouring MASSIVE R&D into catching up.  It takes a few years. Probably late mid 2022 they start pulling ahead. 

The 3% dividends are just there edging you until you blow your load.Thats why im just in index funds lolThis is the wayJNUG lost me so much money in a matter of minutes. miss the old wsb somtimes. what a pile of dogshit that was.Yeah they use amd chipsMany soft license per core and 2x 8 corr can be a sweet spot with Xeon gold 6244 or 6250That's really interesting. I just bought my first AMD Thinkpad. The damn thing has 8 cores. In a laptop!Well said. The DIY market and mid enterprise level (CAD and mid tier workstations) in my opinion are going to take some time. Same argument here for Threadripper as Epyc in server grade. However from a macro level I see the growth being more rapid given that I can't think of another time Intel has been in this weak of a position. All said and told I'm really excited for AMD from a competition standpoint to move the needle like they have been. 

This is good autism. Much appreciated.I’ll take anything I can get sirI hated that sideways action as well. In fact, I dump a ton of swing shares as soon as it hit $59. Now I'm getting sad.

On the flip side, I made good money selling calls when we were stuck in the 50-58 range. I almost got assigned at 56 a couple weeks ago. That would have sucked.

Good job on TSLA. I never got on board with that one. I have traded NIO more recently.Ren tech Medallion fund is only available to employees. Mere mortals will have to settle for WSB memes to get guidance.I got banned from WSB for yelling at people to buy AMD and TSLA.

Soooo.... glass houses/throw stonesYeah gay for pay doesn't mean your actually gayGo fuck yourselfWhat made you think that AMD will continue to gain more , in the end you made 5 times your investment . Look at all the loss porn here , al of them had insane gains at one point but they refused to cash outHaha, I jumped into TSM at open and made a nice 70%, so I can't complain too much, and opened a long dated call on AMD. I think they're pretty undervalued and are in a really great position right now and I think they have the leadership to capitalize on Intel's capitulation. Next CPU upgrade for me will be AMDBut then I have money alreadyYolo’ing 2 mil on 50 different otm options is more our speedHmm I might have to buy shares for my Roth IRA thenMost my customers can utilize a 24c. Smaller customers go cloud hosted apps. Customers that need on site servers need power. I understand how core licensing works.I run the wheel with MSFT and RTX selling calls and puts, what about getting assigned is the downside for you at 56? Are you doing covered calls on all of your shares at once on one strike price?How do you “almost” get assigned?Damn I’m gonna end up having to pay you for consultation. But uh maybe Fuck it and go Berkshire A with a stop loss while you’re on vacation haha 😂Did you buy AMD and TSLA then?Fuck off ya cuntwell, for one, the loss porn here is mostly due to trading insane amounts of weekly options close to expiration and not shares like OP's.

you hold shares when you believe there's still value to be added to the company, and you sell them when it doesn't make sense to keep it, you don't just hold until you hit a magic number... cashing out just means holding USD; I'd rather hold AMD than USD.And you want to preserve that capital whilst growing it low risk, don't you?Current gen is AMD alreadyI need more memory than power.

My 16c 3.6ghz run at 20-30% cpu in average with 40-50 VMs and 70% memory from 512gbMajor tax implications. Shares are easy to replace. >1yr old shares are hard to replace. Multiple strikes usually at 1 week, 2 weeks and 1 monthI sold the 56 call. The stock hovered above 56 which means my broker would take my shares and pay me 56, even if the stock was at 57. However, by expiration day, the price tanked below 56, thus saving my shares.Yes.I’m fucking retarded , i thought he bought options not shares sorry didn’t pay attentionNah, if I’m 65 or so, at that point imma yeet it out the windowAMD seems like to go-to for PC gaming hardware as wellWell that’s fantastic you can get along like that but having consistent utilization like that isnt always acceptable depending on the application. Additionally theres a time vs money in this business. Customers can justify better hardware easily by considering our expense when waiting on slow over utilized servers.all good mate, we all share the same disability.Lol yeah man. Dude has been holding for years. Semi recognizable name.Yeah gotta make it big so I can build a new computer with a 3950xWhat else do they sell?Well they got the 3000 line of ryzen which is really good. Ryzen 3600 (not the x or xt) is the best bang for your buck cpu at the moment. Their GPUs are good but have driver issues. Their high end CPUs like the threadripper or server CPUs EPYC are taking over the enterprise market slowly. They just announced new OEM CPUs for prebuilts that you would buy at best buy. Their laptops are doing great beating out desktop CPUs. At all levels they are challenging Intel.Seems like AMD has the edge on the future. But intel has been around for a while and you can’t doubt them. If AMD kills earnings it’ll probably drop a bit, that’s my guessMy portfolio: AMD puts and Intel calls+shares

It's gonna be a fun week next weekI bought Intel puts last night 5 minutes to close on whim from a random comment here. Not a good strat at ALL but I knew about Intel's current issues and have been long on AMD for a bit. Woke up to see the my puts over 100%. Love itMan.. its almost like someone talked about this in a long ranting post that may or may not have been cocaine-fueled.I owned amd at $15 in 2018 and sold at $18. Bought HEAR at $32, kept it in my portfolio this year because I enjoyed the 2 year landslide of pain, then sold this yr at $5Remember we all use to look at AMD years ago in the single digits$Not the biggest bet, but I did it boys. [1,000% GAINS](https://imgur.com/a/kTAQ54w)Anyone remember the homeboy the other week who called this?Made 1k this morning loading up on Intel at the bottom and selling puts. Cashed out a little earning, could have made 3k. Im thinking Intel has one more day of fading all day. Looking to buy in EOD Monday/ Pre Market Tuesday. Target is $48.15.Play Intel calls next week. Its going to gap up after AMD earnings reportImagine AMD delivered their graphics card too...

Oh well next year ^^TMBought a shit load of INTC today because we’re only at Infinity War not End Game. I’m just sitting here waiting to hear the snap for my tendies.INTC 4.23B shares outstanding x -$9.81 daily change = $41.50B withdrawn.
 
AMD 1.17B shares outstanding x $9.83 daily change = $11.50B added.

Lisa Su: "Where's the money Lebowski?"My balls aren't balancedSo glad I got out of Intel, I was a retard for buying into that shit company in the first place.INTC $60 call 8/28; $60 call 9/4; $57.5 call 9/18 🙏🏻Fucking love this subThis is the best sub on this GD site.  Consistently posting quality content.  No S..I bought calls on both, holding through the weekendI'll give you 2 tries to guess which one i have calls for and which one I have puts for  clownemojiWould getting long intel calls be a big brain playTrump should learn how to balance trade so perfectly with ChinaI bought intel puts at the 55 strike over a month ago predicting this exact event. I let them expire worthless last week because I didn’t have the balls to roll them. I’m doing a major sad right now.Intel had every advantage, for a very long time, and still can't compete. Capitalism at its finest. Good job AMD.It seemed to stay balanced most of the day too.All this talk about AMD and no love toward TSMC. 

INTC is talking about issues with their fab process so TSMC should be the real winners.I had AMD calls. I was planning to play ER and totally didn't expect today. Anyone planning to load up on INTC calls? The drop seems to be an over reaction.Just nevermind INTC market cap is still 3x greater. I want to see equal weight equity transfer - bullishDon’t fucking remind meIf anything the balance of the post is going to swing way towards amd because they are so much smaller that Intel's shit show is a huge positive for amd.https://ibb.co/5LnfwCS

keep for reference to know how it looks when AMD squeezes up on days like this.I'm confident AMD and Intel will trade places, AMD is the new King, byebye Intel.8/7 60p on AMD. bought 5x contracts todayLOLBuy intel calls, easy money. Intel makes much more money than AMD lmaoWe'll see how long this lasts, then you AMD owners can get back to playing minecraft at your jerkoff station in your moms basement ...calls on intelI said fuck it I'll go heavy on AMD 65p*cries in NVIDIA*Nerdlingers at r/pcmasterrace will appreciate
 
Then they'll tell you all about how the i9 is still the best gaming CPU.
But Ryzen and threadripper CPUs are pretty tits.WSB and Thanos...perfectly balancedNiceForgot $TSM, the people's favoritegood memeHope my amd puts print smhOoofIntel's gonna shit the bed on their 7nm too. I say wait with intel till..... 2023-25, it'll hit rock bottom and buy them, and hold till they bounce like amd did**Just pulled out of AMD.** 

Bought it before the COVID crash at 54.

Held. 

It stagnates for half a year. 

I sell to go into a tech ETF cause AMD ain't moving. 

INTC takes a shit.

AMD goes up 16% while tech industry drops.

Thanks AMDIntel market share for PC chips 80%. Server chips 90%. AMD is chipping away clearly but Intel is dominant Brand. This means cash retards, $25B on Balance Sheet. $38B in operating cash flow. This buys them time. Dominant share +Capital + iconic brand = recovery. Don’t be surprised if Lisa Su joins INTC because of the opportunity to lead the comeback of this iconic brand.175% UP on my AMD stonksWhat this shows is that Intel future price chart will look like AMD’s chart in reverseCan't believe AMD hit 69.420 todayLove how the dipshit analysts, up to and including Cramer recommended INTC over AMD.. yeah, right. AMD is taking over INTC.. eat shit already. It's like they do that to intentionally move liquidity over to INTC so they can get out of their positions to buy AMD instead.Bought and held Intel from years ago at around $30.

Never thought it was good to buy into or even reinvest dividends into it, but picked up some just now after the 15% dip.Amd for the winnnnnnnnDoes anyone know whether Dell, Lenovo and HP started to transition to AMD and whether there is any news of cloud computing companies choosing Epyc over Xeon? Would really like to understand how Intel's operational problems will translate to an impact on earnings.Goddamn it, they are much closer than Intel.Well this is a epyc momentMy blood was boiling post earnings call. A chip maker that doesn't make chips? How do you fuck up this bad Intel??! Lost money on LEAPS but it's fine because now I get to short the shit out of Intel until then declare bankruptcy.Nicer/ayymd Petition to put this post on the approved posts listAMD is going to absolutely gut them when zen 3 comes out.16.5
16.24

#PERFECTLYBALANCEDSaw amd drop above 4% and went full yolo next Day 16%+ lets gooSo are you guys all buying a the 1 week calls and puts or going longer term? I'm very new to options.bloodbath for intel share holdersTsmc also got some action from this by 9.73%Made with mematic...as all things should be.Lol I was telling my friend this exact same thing.Actually completely unbalanced if you can napkin math. INTC lost 40bil in market cap while AMD gained 9bil. The better comparison would include TSMC.

However, nice meme.Time to load up on amd callsAnother thing. You don’t overpay for the stocks of semiconductor companies. Very cyclical industry with high capital needs. Anyone buying AMD at 160 PE deserves to get fucked. Many a trader has lost their shirt on AMD in past 20 years getting sucked into the story and overpaying for growth that never happened.Intel calls are one announcement away of 5nm to destruction...  mind you apple is funding that tsmc build out.Bought an INTC $57 put contact for $0.51 near close on Thursday w/ 7/24 expiry. Sold it for $7 shortly after open yesterday for 1,400% gains. Why do sellers even offer these contracts so cheap so close to earnings?Someone I follow on IG posted this Medium article a couple months back and I’m KICKING myself for not following his logic: [https://link.medium.com/TyW6Rz0B4](https://link.medium.com/TyW6Rz0B46)Intel intel intelWhat do you think is going to happen Intel hits 40 for a half a day?? Even better when I finesse my calls like I'm your wifes bf.. 
 
Get back to call of duty while your AMD computer lights up like a homosexual ufo\*tuh thu  


tuh tuh\*Except Intel eating shit doesn't mean AMD reaps the benefit entirely and probably far less than most fanboys realize.  The server space is a battle Royale and not Intel vs AMD.  Nvidia will still kick AMD in the nutz when it comes to graphics cards.  And while Intel is sucking steadily at the desktop, they probably will still technically put out the "best CPU for gaming" again even though you'd be stupid to buy it vs the value proposition AMD will offer for total speed with all the cores/threads.  But Intel is expected to put out a very competitive CPU/GPU combo to fight the AMD APU.  They've upped their graphics game and the barely adequate to run your OS integrated Intel graphics is getting replaced with something competitive with the nvidia MX350 which is a little better than Vega 8 graphics.This isn’t perfectly balanced bitch boy 🥴🤷‍♂️16.5 =/= 16.24

OP confirmed retarded.i just ditched my intel based macbook pro for a custom liquid cooled desktop with a Ryzen 9 3950x, 128gb RAM and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 by EVGA(waiting for new cards to drop to drop some real money) ....

I will never go back to Intel if given a choice.. i only spent $3500ish(of my trading profits) to build this and the equivalent Mac(in a desktop) would start at $5000ish and need $3000ish in upgrades to be around the same specs... in a laptop you cant even get this many cores or ram and it would still cost $4000ish+...

i know custom desktop to mac laptop is not a fair comparison... but i am running Dual boot Pop!\_OS and Windows..  i code for research, and now game on pc, read all of yall's retarded comments, and basically live on the computer...

Intel is dead to me... short that bitch into the ground!

&#x200B;

\[edit\] whenever i need compute power and i'm at the university or whatever.. i just use my iPad Pro to ssh into my custom built pc and voila.... no excuses for needing an intel based macThose aren't even the same number retard.I just bought 5 AMD shares 2 days ago, this is epic**I am a bot.

Gonna hold my breath all next week, will definitely be kicking myself if AMD rockets into the 70s, because my plan is to get back in under $65.....I was surprised Intel hovered around 60 as long as it had. They're selling server chips with two year old processor form factors for twice the price of AMD's Rome procs. For every company looking to do a refresher on hardware, the choice was a no-brainer. The Rome 2 procs were something we waited to August 2019 to order, and there was such a backlog from orders, that delivery occurred in May of 2020.

I don't think Intel is going to do well. I am surprised they remained $60 until they lost $9 premarket.

Yes, Intel does have other revenue streams: network chipsets, motherboards, storage SSD fab, ~~video cards~~, etc. Still, I can't help but think that Intel's lack of R&D into another processor architecture informs me as to their company modus operandi: they rode astride the chip manufacturing world for too long, and a more innovative company is now eating their lunch. They were content to imagine that single-NUMA architecture was going to continue to dominate, while AMD focused on multiple NUMA nodes.

The disadvantage of single NUMA architecture is the complexity of assembling a die with 24 or 28 cores as a single unit. A lot of their production is thrown away or put into a lower bin when a manufacturing defect takes place. This effectively increases the cost or manufacturing, and Intel processor prices as a whole.

AMD on the other hand, has been developing the Zepplin architecture since the Bulldozer chips in 2011. Their goal was to make production easy by assembling NUMA node modules in batches, and then later integrating them on the  CPU die with a separate processor responsible for intra-node communication. This decreases the points of failure from the entire die, down to single cpu components. This decreases their rate of rejection, which gives them the upper hand on price.

The final nail in the coffin for Intel is their inability to close the architecture process size below 10nm. When I'd heard that AMD was producing 7nm processors, I was intrigued what Intel's response was going to be. When it came out that they were going to be producing only mobile processors at 10nm, I knew they were in trouble.
Intel has become second-class, and if they don't invest in some serious R&D on their process and architecture, their processor division will soon become redundant.

I am ultra-bearish on Intel in the long run. I cannot understand anybody claiming otherwise, and they are going to suffer immensely. Their R&D teams are definitely being whipped in the back rooms.Hey, I don't really trade options since options trading is quite dead in my country, but isn't this a typical case where IV crush will most probably happen? Buying options right after a catalyst event seems super risky, if my understanding is correct.Why? Amd is "overvalued" and Intel isn't or just gambling randomlyI never understand why people would contra-play both of these stocks regardless which direction. Just pick one and go for it.Intel has been in the shitter for a while now, 7nm is still at least another year or two from hitting shelves whereas amd is busy improving their existing 7nm chipsThat's what you get for having Intel Stockholm syndrome. The elite among us nerds have known for some time that the rein of Intel has come to an end.If one goes up other goes down, your account is balancedYou actually are retarded, please stay.only 100% gain on a 15% drop? The premiums must have been crazyIt was probably one of my comments. I been bashing Intel all day. You can pay me in beer.Only 100%??? Should’ve bought more OTM I guess or amd calls. AMD 63c were just $0.07 yesterday at close. It would’ve been $6 today. That’s 10000% returns> on whim from a random comment here

This is the way.They are going to think you did insider trading. Doesn't matter since it's worth nothing.Did the opposite. You’re welcome. 

At such a low PE relative to market figured nothing could move it..Fantastic timing. 

It’s been known intel is screwed but that timing is impeccable.The weeklies were nuts. 

55 P were .05 at market close on Thursday. Essentially went up 100xgood workgosh i really want to learn options trading where to start on how to trade options?Lol you sold 100% too early. I felt bad selling my put 800% gain figuring it would drop more and it did. Would have had a 1200% gain but I’ll take 800. Especially over 100% you nerd what did you buy 65 puts?Put even more on it. Intel is dead, their executives are idiotsSuck my nutThanks.  I hate it.  Intel puts up huge numbers and has a great p/e ratio.  Drops insane amount.

&#x200B;

AMD has a fucking 166 p/e ratio,  That's fucking normal.  Their profit margins are also small in comparison, meaning Intel could drop theirs if they actually needed to compete.Link?Someone get this man a flairAmazing mate.no it's still a cocaine fueled rant, but it panned out.Nice prediction. Any thoughts on AMD price target in 1-2 years?If it makes you feel better Hog Fucker, I was in amd at around 6 (can’t remember exactly but definitely single digits) and out at like 15% profitI've had AMD since $22 but only have 20 shares and never bought more. So pussy. UGH.I bought AMD at $3 and some change, sold at $14. This was before Ryzen became a thing, so I'm fine with that decision. I do regret not getting in when Ryzen launched though. Also I didn't expect Intel to shit the bed for all these years both on node and architecture improvements, and now with Jim Keller gone, it's even more questionable of how much longer Intel will under deliver. Plus ARM is finally making way into home PC's via Apple.

AMD bounced back, but the key to AMD's new found success is moreso due to Intel's failures.Good. Sell your winners and hold your losers. This is what someone with no fundamental analysis does.First bought at $2.10. Made about 100k overall from AMD. Dealing with all the negative price targets and obviously manipulation attempts definitely taught me a huge amount about investing.This is the wayThat's okay, I owned 6000 shares at $12.7 and would sell way otm covered calls throughout 2018 to make some premiums

Ended up selling all 6k shares for $12.79

Not going to do the math on the money I left on the tableBetter than my guy that sold his AMD holdings to buy Blue Apron IPO at $10 a pop.I bought AMD at 2.50, only put $150 on it. Still have it and hate myself despite the 5k gainI’m still holding Amd at $30 on my paper portfolio. Too bad it isn’t my real one.I had AMD at $3.40 a few years back.  Sold at $22.  Kick myself everyday for selling when I look at the prices but hey, it’s part of the game.I bought AMD a while ago over a time period of about a year with an average share price at 6.50.  I sold earlier this spring at around $50/share.  I shouldn't complain, I made a bunch on it and I was getting increasingly nervous of having so much of it.  I try not to look at the process of things I've sold, but this popped up here and it really kicked me in the nads.AMD was my first "reddit" stockI want to do that now- look at a company in single digits and load the fuck upHoly shit congrats dawgCongrats. Positions?Yeah the huge DD about that lead architect leaving INTC. The comments are all pro-INTC aged milk lmfao check it outYeah that was a dumb post though.

Intel's deep troubles have been known for years. If you were holding that shit and only saw the light a couple weeks ago because of some rant on a homo-autistic fantasy forum written immediately after some dude did a couple lines, well...Ah, so you’re the guy who sold me half of the strangle I opened today. A worthless strangle against a flat line, well done.Thoughts on atm Intel call leaps?anytime I see posts like this that is pretty much fueled on blind confidence, I inverse that shit.I went the boomer way and bought intc shares while they were in the bargain binSorry chief, my puts think otherwiseToo late for that, will be up 4% Monday morningSmarter call might be to dump or trim AMD holdings. AMD earnings will be solid but it's like every fucking quarter they hit guidance on the dot and guide slightly up for next Q.

Then the hype train crashes, people realize it's not a magical money machine like the Fed, and we repeat 2 weeks before next QE.I hammered them calls today daddyyyy strictly off the -15% day. Don’t tell boyfriendTSM 5.186B shares outstanding x $6.42 daily change = $33.3B added.Proof or gtfoGood luckSameTime to buy some new cardigans and pass out tendies like the 80sSamsung ain't doing the best either. TSM is going on a tear the next 3 years, mark my words.This guy semiconductorsHonestly it just makes me sad.  I know Intel has their anti-consumer moments but I really hope they don't fall behind and become what AMD was 10 years ago.  I want these two companies in lock step competing hard.  I don't want x86 to fall by the wayside in the home computing market but Apple is pushing that.I bought calls eodthis wasnt so much a squeeze as it was a liquidity crunch.Thought this too, current gen I've heard nothing but good coming from amd, I bought in to it yesterday before the spike mostly because I'm a bit of an amd fanboy, hoping it carries on. Might buy Intel while it's low tho...While AMD could go beyond Intel, if they even split the market cap that means AMD stock will double again. Plus they have a GPU line that sucks but might be good in the future. Idk if that counts as DD but that's why I'm long on AMD.10/18 60p 10x. Super excited to get fucked out of $3k next week when WSB meme strength and fed fuckery pushes that shit to the 80s by EOW... wiping our faces with tendies tho.How mad are you?https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-announces-delay-to-7nm-processors-now-one-year-behind-expectations

Enjoy those fuckin' ~~losses~~ calls.

Let me know if you need to hop aboard a ride on the AMD Hype Train... 5 nm and Zen 4 together next year... Zen 3 this year to fucking crush Intel's gaming dominance in every single category... not to mention still the sole provider for PS5 / new Xbox. We'll find you a seat in coach.

These fuckers can't even get 10nm right and they were talking about 7nm, now they've managed to fuck that up too thanks to sheer incompetence.

If you want to piss away money, you should stick to drugs, whores, booze, and cigars - its far more enjoyable.i9 is a space heater that runs a computer as a byproduct>Then they'll tell you all about how the i9 is still the best gaming CPU

It is. It's price to performance is not that good though.ThisIntel is behind amd+tsmc by 3-5 years... that's an eternity in tech.  I'm sure they will survive but amd has the opportunity to take large chunks out of their businessWhich is an amazing feat if you think about it. For as long as I have known AMD, they have been on the heels of INTC.

Today felt like a passing of the torch.1 weekIsn't Apple planning to slowly move to their own processors as well instead of Intel?Can confirm. Am retarded pl0x help meOh dear. I'm afraid you're in for a nasty surprise. Even if AMD drops somewhat your premiums won't increase. And yes, it's just a matter of time before AMD goes higher so you're betting against the trend.The fomo train that's about to slam into AMD is going to be something else. At least half as good as tslai don’t wanna rain on your tendies parade but w the big expectations from zen 3 and rdna 2 i have a feeling amd might trend up until release. but as always, this is a casino.Lol idiotIntel used to be the kings of consumer cpus, when amd had its FX series processors under the bulldozer architecture intel could charge as much as they wanted for their consumer chips and nobody could really do anything since intel cpus were so much better, but now intel is still thinking they are the top dogs even with ryzen, I think this is gonna be a wake up call to intel, they either get their shit together now, or continue to fall and find themselves in the same position as amd 4-5 years agoAMD did *kinda* back off from NUMA. Even Threadripper is all a single memory domain, and EPYC can be configured that way as well. At least as far as the OS can tell. It's still non-uniform internally, but the chip tries a lot harder to paper it over than in older AMD processors.

Edit: this doesn't change the big picture, just saying NUMA was not quite as clear a winner and AMD ended up compromising a bit. Overall this is often how it goes: AMD picks the clearly correct long term direction, but rolls it back a bit when it becomes apparent it's a little too big a step for current OSes and applications.Cathie from Ark investments agrees

Exactly. Passive/benchmark-sensitive investors have been protecting $INTC from reality for the last ten years, buying it only because it is one of the large tech positions in benchmarks, enabling it to rest on its laurels even though Moore’s Law had hit a wall.
Quote TweetI believe Intel can survive on their ecosystem in the server space making it hard for Vendors to switch, and mindshare among the general population who don't pay much attention to CPU benchmarks and only know Intel, for another several years while gradually losing market share to AMD before they can come out with something competitive.  When you no longer have a competitive product, lean hard on aggressive sales tactics and marketing, Intel certainly has the money to play that game.>intel does have other revenue streams: video cards, etc. 

there is not even single intel video card out there in market! 

what are you talking about ?

intel gonna release video card but when it will happen no one knows.It will be just like nvda all over again. It'll be 'overvalued' from here on out all the way to $400.Intel is overvalued. They are the loser, and are going to be playing catch-up for at least two years. The fact that they can't touch a 7nm process yet, and are at least six months to a year behind AMD in that category, shows you how poorly things are going for them.

In the strictest sense of the idea of winners and losers, Intel lost almost a year ago, and they will continue to do so into the foreseeable future.

No infrastructure architect is going to look at a choice between a 64-core AMD processor for $6500, or a 56-core Intel processor for $72,000 and choose Intel. The only people who are going to go with Intel are doing it with religious fervor. That, or their current server infrastructure is running Intel presently, and migration away will cost more than it's worth in time and effort.This whole thing is because Intel said they can't do 7nm until 2022 at the earliest.Nah I said over 100%. I didn't register how much over because my eyes were barely open when I checked and I was shocked at the number. Was either 160% or 360% lol. I bought the puts at 2.26 each and sold at \~9.55 each

 https://imgur.com/2Sy3tkL>only 100% gain

WSB ladies and gentlemen3:59:50pm, nice

Edit: whoops I responded to the wrong commentCan I come over for coffee?is there a place for historical options chain?Yup, I had 61s and 62s. Bought 62s at .08 and .09 sold half at open for over 5000% and rest later in the day for almost 8500%. For those who are wondering why I made that bet, I didn’t feel like paying premium on INTC puts, and figured AMD would move up regardless of results on INTC.Nobody’s going to think you insider traded on that move aloneyeah I only made like 5K and wanted to take a gamble on these big drop days because I've been only holding stocks & they were getting hit. Randomly saw intel as an opportunity for puts.You can basically insider trade all tech stocks by being under the age of 40 lmao who needs to actually insider trade? You're up against a bunch of fucking boomers who can barely program fox news into their tv.

&#x200B;

Probably 4/5 of the money in FB is controlled by people who still think its a college town and not a retirement community.Check out the craps table at Caesar’s Palace. Good first place to learn.Ask your motherOk"Intel puts"... You got it bud! Solid!They announced that they are yet again behind on their processor mode process.

Emphasis on AGAIN.It actually does make sense when Intel is expected to hemorrhage market share. AMD's offerings are superior now to the point that Intel is going to almost certainly lose it's lucrative server farm contractsThey can't drop thier prices, Intel has much higher cost structure than AMD.https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbr1ol/get_the_fuck_out_of_intel_and_get_out_immediately/“Intelligent”2000If it makes you feel better I bought AMD at $1.92 and sold ~$6.80. wasted all my gains on OTM options after that when if I held I'd almost have a millionI had AMD at 2.15 and stopped myself out at 1.85 back in 2016That is why I am bag holding AMD indefinitely. Whether it hits 3 digits or sink down to $10, I'm Hold.Shit, I had tsla from $60 to $73, and AMD at $3.60Imma be ultra real here:

Sell those off (~1350) and fucking yolo them into $80 calls exp 1/15/21

--

Intel is all out of good news for the year.

AMD hasn't even fully released the goods on their 4000 series, and on the enterprise market they continue to chip away at Intel's share with Intel doing fuck-all to stop that bleeding.

When AMD hits ~85-88, take the fucking win and go home.Really though AMD has been hitting every step of the plans they laid out around Ryzen launch. Intel's self-inflicted disaster just happened to make each of those steps so much more valuable.

Perfect execution versus absolute incompetence, who would have ever guessed?The reason I sold amd is because I started seeing the stock on this sub. That supercedes any faThis is the wayWhat is the point of a long term paper portfolio?AMD was my first stock ever. Super cheap lotto ticket for an outside chance at bringing competition to a very complacent Intel.

Hurt to see my first pick drop from $2.55 to $1.60 or whatever, but... I feel better now.$60 put 7/24 expiry. Bought 12 contracts for 88c/eachOn another subreddit, I saw posts from people arguing that Intel could stay on 14nm indefinitely "because the market seems to love buying their 14nm products and even the restarted 22nm ones", "Intel can just refine 10nm like what they did with 14nm for 6 years and it worked out well", saw nothing wrong with the analysts all asking about the 7nm delays and "Intel is too big to fail".

A moderator there also insisted that there was nothing wrong with Intel's shares losing value and it would be great for them to do more buybacks, and that buybacks isn't wasting money as it's merely returning them to investors.I'm looking to buy shares and sell puts. IV is too high in my opinion to mess with buying calls.Not blind , it's pretty obvious. Look at the fundamentals , net income of Intel is 21B in 2019 and revenue is 72B. Net income of AMD in 2019 is 341M and their revenue is 6.73B. You guys are really retarded if you didn't buy this Intel dip after good earnings.Fuck.  Now I need to inverse your blind confident inverse so calls it isRemindme! 7 daysIn any war, the one who manufacturers the bullets for both sides is the real winnerI tripled my TSMC common stock the afternoon before on a whim. Was pleasantly surprised. Usually that stock does nothing.Ah ha, the missing money has been found!  The universe in perfect balance, indeed.Everything is over boughtI doubt it. I think markets gonna be red next week during earnings weekLol. I'm seeing the pricing action at open on Monday. Surely it doesn't gap up more than a few bucks if it opens green. 

I do think it could drop down a few bucks at open. That's why I didn't buy calls. 

If it opens green, we are off to the races again. I'm buying August 7 75 calls. 

I think AMD is $65 or lower sometime Tuesday. But if it's not. It's probably going to be $80 ha.None I cant wait for this to pay everyone in the Intel threads...I usually buy AMD computers too🤣You forgot to mention getting dropped by AppleThat great news was the reason we were blessed with an amazing dealPremiums won’t increase?Plz this. I need this one!AMD $100 eowSir, this is an Arby’s.Intel won't see results hit shelves until 3-5 years after the "get their shit together." If they had a successful plan underway, we would have heard about it at earnings. Instead they announced basically that the plane has crashed into the side of the mountain.I think it's too late for Intel. They are at least a year behind in development, and to my knowledge, they have yet to start fabrication of NUMA architectures separate from the CPU die. Without a way to adequately account for inevitable manufacturing errors, their products are going to be consistently more expensive due to losses.

Even though Intel's single core processing power is typically superior to  AMD, now that most programs are capable of multi-threaded operation, that's not really much of an advantage. The only place that single NUMA configurations win out is when running single programs capable of multi-threading more than the highest NUMA node count, which for AMD is 32 processors per Zepplin. That limits the amount of memory which can be addressed by a NUMA node, which can be the absolute ceiling for a specific program.

From server perspective, it's no big deal to separate virtual processors. Intra-node communication is slowed due to the need to pass memory addressing between nodes, but that's about it.

Intel processors will become a specialty for high speed processing, while AMD will be useful for every other type of work.

The next thing AMD needs to solve is their NUMA node interconnect. If passing traffic between nodes and addressed memory became negligible, then their processors could behave more like an Intel single node unit, which would negate the need to manage memory addressing based on architecture.One thing that bummed me out was the fact that the Zepplin interconnects were still produced with a 14nm process while the Zepplins are 7nm

I'm presuming that they will rectify this at a later point, which will probably improve throughput.

Still, they're definitely doing a better job than Intel, and I think this is one of the more classic comeback stories if there ever was one.I refuse to buy a company who shines turds. If it were 20 years ago, and Intel were still trying to crush competition with commercials like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gso3g_ofjlw), sure. People these days are a little more savvy when it comes to purchases. I will withhold judgement until I see AMD's quarterly earnings report, but I am going to assume that they gained what Intel lost.They are going to release a video card, which will be an income stream. Are you going to be okay?

They do have other revenue streams: they have networking, they have Non-volotile SSD storage, they have IOT shit, they have mobile processor stuff, they do a bunch of things.NVDA did have a ~50% correction though, took them basically a year to bounce back from that.

AMD could be overvalued in the short run. 4 years from now I don't see any way that current SP is justified and then some.But Intel does so many other things besides CPUs have to check on their 10-k but even if they sold no CPUs they do more revenue than amd.Yeah, but Intel has been lagging on 7nm for a long time so I'm not surprised they are still having issuesCongrats on the big win, and also fuck you.This retard can't divide 9.55 / 2.26 and he's still banging my wifeDid you check your Robinhood options while pooping and waiting for your coffee to brew. My man, the investing class these days are legendaryI bought 10/16 OTM puts in May, used that to pick up some end of august ITM calls today. I hope the 15% is an overreaction short term, but I know Intel has other major challenges ahead4:20:69 nicerBring some condoms and lube lolDunt do it!  He'll put something in your coffee!As long as you byop, cuz I ain't sharing mine. I get the feeling that won't be a problem for you.ToSI have a list of moves that would not only prove I’m not insider trading but that make a strong case of me being retarded.How does one identify opportunity ?More like the truck-stop casinohahaha thats a best place for everyone to startcant remember the last time i met your motherCongrats thoLove that the top comment is that the rant is bullshit and to not short intel lmaoThis guy is a genius or an insiderI’ll be honest that does make me feel a bit better, at least you still saw a really nice gain thoughYou got me at $80 calls. Except I'm doing it for August not for some next year shit. ;)what was intel's self-inflicted disaster? staying at 14nm too long?I’ve been here long enough to remember when WSB memed BAC to death. You did the safe thing.I forgot that I even had it until I saw the movement today.The point is paper profit... to have paper Lambo... :)>f anything the balance of the post is going to swing way towards amd because they are so much smaller that Intel's shit show is a huge positive for amd.

INTC or AMD?https://imgur.com/4rhcQJ8.jpg

January 2022 leaps. 

For around 17 months of time, Intel needs to go up 15.7% to breakeven.

If you factor in the 59 cents of intrinsic value, it's 14.52%.

The IV for leaps doesn't sound so bad to me.Bruh, it's based on future expectations.

AMD is grabbing market share like a hungry slut (not just in consumer PCs but also in consoles, enterprise, servers, etc), and INTC just continues to fuck up everything. It's honestly sort of amazing how many mistakes Intel has made in the past year or so, and they are legitimately at risk of becoming completely uncompetitive.

They basically lost 100% of the enthusiast/custom PC market overnight, and most of their revenue now comes from contracts with Dell, Lenovo, Apple, etc for desktop and notebook CPUs (and a few other random components, like wifi and Bluetooth cards). And, these companies will almost definitely be looking to AMD, as Intel's 7nm chips aren't expected to be available until *at least* 2022, and AMD is already mass-producing. Depending on how hard these companies ditch Intel, it could be an actual death blow. 

And that doesn't even bring up the issue that things are shifting more and more to mobile platforms, where Intel completely failed. Companies like Apple, Samsung, and Qualcomm absolutely dominate in the mobile SoC sector and managed to castrate a titan when Intel attempted to enter that market and failed miserably. 

It's bad news all around. 

Does that mean they can't come back? No. Of course they can. But the concerns are real.

What other major stocks have you seen recently crash 13% on earnings then just... Stay there? Flat? We are in the most legendary dip-buying market of all time, where almost any dip will be bought without any logic, and yet no one would touch INTC, which is one of the biggest tech companies in the world.

It's a bit concerning.

Your DD is basically "bruh, it's Intel. And they made a lot of money in 2019." But that's frankly just not very good DD my friend.I would but all my money is otherwise used

Edit: Will sell something and buy 10k of leaps on monday

Edit 2: from all the replies you got i changed my mind and will go all inThen go back to 2019 and buy it then, cuz 2021 sure as shit ain't 2019.Bought AMD puts and INTC calls today. Am I doing this right?what you're saying is just pure exuberance. You don't know, and it isn't obvious. You do realize AMD announced a line of CPU on 7nm that have integrated graphics and will gobble up market shares in the workspace/contracts with PC manufacturers. When you have a CPU that uses less power and have better single AND multi core performance why would you stick with the competitor?. That's why AMD rallied 7% when they announced the line. Then intel announces they're 6 months behind on 7nm when they're already 3 generations behind AMD. Yeah intel made a lot of money, but investors see that it is slowing down significantly and momentum is all on AMD. Intel will recover, but to say it'll recover on AMD news is just not DD and I personally would not hold intel calls.  If AMD announces something major in terms of 7nm release Intel will get pooped on. Don't call people retarded when your play isn't sound.No one gives a shit what they're making right now.lol, fundamentals.There is a 16 hour delay fetching comments.

|-|-|-|-|From a rational standpoint, I agree. That said, each time I think these markets are going to be rational we make ridiculous new highs market-wide. Primary thing that has me nervous is two large permabear trader/organizations I follow went bullish Friday (edit: this morning), with a buy alert on the QQQs and several big tech positions. When even the bears are telling you the market is poised for a rally, Magic 8-Ball says: "lol I told you to buy the fucking dip."Sentiment going into next week is super bullish from many sources - my rainbow bear ass just can't help itself with buying new bags to hold. But, like, maybe fighting the fed will work out one day - once I become a bull again and the market tanks.🍆Goddamn that's what I love about WSB... endless hope in the face of certain disaster.Read his tag. Explains a lotThe premiums [he is receiving for selling the calls] won't increase [due to being maxed out due to IV] and his risk is high as he is trading against the trend. He can hope that he wins on theta and sells high IV but there has obviously been a fundamental news shift here.You right, they still think they’re the top dogs, they still have their servers but they need to realize they have competition from amd now. I think intel can recover, they have plenty of money, but they need better management and a few years of a more consumer friendly business model so that customers gain confidence in them again, they’re a long term play for their stock but they need changes soon.It's trading at like 10-11c forward earnings 

All of its recent earnings reports have been positive


You think Intel is going to fall behind AMD?Right, from what I heard companies are beginning to buy AMD processors for their thread count over intels faster single thread performance, but the one thing intel still has is the “fastest gaming cpu,” and for competitive gaming tournaments intel is pretty much the only thing used, just having the ability to say you have the “fastest gaming cpu” is super valuable to intel however if amd make a faster gaming cpu intel is screwed, not to mention how amd has their chips being used in consoles, and from what I’ve heard they have graphics chips being used in smartphones as well, intels been doing the same for years and they need to adapt like amd hasYeah, eff Intel, but don't be quick the count the Empire out, they'll dust off their old Anti-competitive playbook for the next several years to stay in the game, before they can counter AMD with a competitive product.

Waiting on AMD's quarterly earnings as well, it's always been speculated that why AMD share price hasn't been doing better is that they're supply constrained, covid certainly didn't help with either, it's likely why their Notebooks have come out so late, and their server marketshare hasn't grown as rapidly as expected, and their APU's receive staggered late releases from their main desktop CPU lineup...not to mention why they don't have any high-end GPU's to compete with Nvidia.

I'm sure AMD will do well on their Quarterly Earnings, but if it'll be enough to justify yesterday's spectacular run-up remains to be seen, but a merely "Meet expectations" results, and another 20-30% projected growth on guidance, may not matter too much if people are buying AMD with hopes of greater future growth...  Since I sold all my AMD shares and stocks last week in the insane run-up, I've been terrified that I may not be able to get back in the low to mid 60s price-point, barring a systemic crash in the stock market as a whole...  This could've been AMD's moment where they're seen as a "Tesla" stock, where current earnings no longer matter in the pricing of their stock, only future potential is what is driving their price from now on....  Next week should be interesting.>They are going to release a video card

still are going to. no one knows its will get released or not.Can’t  do simple arithmetic, makes thousands on options anyways like a true autistAfter that he would probably wonder how the hell a number beginning with 3 is representative of over 300%.Flair checks outYeah, just show the SEC my last 12 losing trades that were just as autisticHard same. It’s comical at this pointThink that goes for just about anybody on this sub. The strong stench of retard here protects us all from suspicion of insider trading.It was honestly a gamble and I didn’t care about the outcome because I’ve been so desensitized to my account plateauing for the past month. And I told myself it could only go up or down. However, I only used cash I could afford to lose. 

These past few red days gave me an extra push too. No idea what Monday is gonna look like. Also I’m a lurker in lots of gaming communities and I’ve seen a big tide turning towards AMD over Intel the past few years. Definitely know what stock you’re dealing with. I pay attention to what people like and hate about the company and see which side outweighs which. Then come to your own conclusionr/ExplainmelikeIamfive<3 thanks good luck to youThe rant was pretty much bullshit. Keller leaving may or may not have had anything to do with Intel's fab process fiasco.

The writing has been on the wall for 2+ years now, especially the past year after Zen2 release. Intel just confirmed what anybody with half a brain should have suspected was happening.

You would have to be a fucking idiot to try to hold INTC over the past 2 years with the precarious position they're in.Or simply an PC enthusiastNo, someone in the PC community. Intel is pulling some bullshit rn.Honestly even ignoring Jim Keller's resignation if you were active in the PC community you'd still know that Intel was going under soon. Ryzen chips are absolutely dominating the market and AMD's super high end processors are incredibly efficient for servers. Also Intel's i9 processors which were marketed to be a worthy successor was also an expensive mess that overheats laptops and saps way too much power.

TL;DR: This is what happens when you dominate a market for so long and get comfortable, thinking there won't possibly be a good competitor.It was my second trade ever. My first one was some Biopharma company that Shkrelli bought that went from a penny stock to $20+ overnight. I lost $300 in 15 minutes (which is the most money I've ever lost and so quickly too) from that play and then did massive DD before going all in on AMD (my dd came from me being a big tech nerd back then and not understanding why AMD was so cheap compared to Intel given their new CPUs were rock solid and being used everywhere for mining).My point was that it's bound to hit 85-88 between now and Jan, and you could just take the profits and work on the next move.

August... I'd have said go $75... but if you're going $80 I hope you went for the 28th to give yourself a bit more room.Going after fully integrated die with low yield vs. AMD going with multiple smaller die per chip to improve yield.Yes, their manufacturing got stuck because they aimed way to high with 10nm in 2015, instead for the gradual approach of Samsung and TSMC, which did small steps (16-14-12-10-8-7, now soon 5 with + versions at every step (yes i know those numbers are only roughly comparable and Intels 10nm \~ TSMC 7nm if it would work but still) ). They tried way to many new unproven things at once, and when that failed instead of starting from scratch, they fell for the sunk cost fallacy where they tried to make the doomed 10nm work.

Also Intel for a long time had architecture bound to node size which meant that improvements of the cores could would be implemented in the 14+++++++++nm chips because those improvements where planed for the 10nm chips.

And finally their product management also shit the bed. For the first 2 years Ryzen 1000 and 2000 where still inferior to Intels 6000/7000/8000 but they did not respond in price and product stack allowing AMD to undercut them significantly and place 6c/12T CPUs against 4C/4T CPUs while removing "pro" features from products for segmentation's sake when AMD just offered those features throughout their entire lineup.

Intel could have countered AMD in many ways, but they did not.Murthy. Murthy is Intel's self-inflicted disaster.The custom PC market is the WSB of computers you beautiful autist, it’s a meaningless drop in bucket that is the market. Those laptops and corporate computers you scoff at from your 35 year old pillow fort are fucking 99.9% of the machine that is consumer grade computers.Gaming is a tiny percentage of revenue compared to what intel sells to the likes of Dell and HP.  The majority of corporate environments run intel hardware. Always have, and for the foreseeable future, always will. There’s more to these businesses than just gaming benchmarks.You jerkoffs act like intel just filed for bankruptcy. 

Sure amd has a sexy lineup hitting the market this fall. How long will that take to reflect in sales?

The larger point is that this selloff of 16% off of a bluechip will likely provide a bounce up.you didn't need to write an essay to this idiot why his claim is total bullshit that's why this dude stay broke. can't think further past his own bubble.I feel like since the previous CEO of INTC got \#metoo'ed, the company has gone to shit. INTC can't manage to do anything really remarkable in the CPU realm, meanwhile the underdog AMD is literally shitting on them in an amazing fashionLmao if you think PC enthusiasm was driving 20 billion for IntelIntel is still king in consumer PC. There's a reason why their high end shit like i9-10900k is out of stock and gets resold on Ebay. AMD will never catch up to Intel's revenue/profit unless they make their own shit.Intel and consoles?About a year or so ago I read they hired the guy that designed the Ryzens. But I haven't been keeping up.I did the same shit brothaPretty much all modern cpu have integrated graphics.... and they definitely don't have better performance than Intel. Only thing AMD beats Intel is that they use less power , and lower price.How did they make 3 billion more than last year's Q2 if no one gives a shit?What trader originations are thoseYeah but I refuse to believe anything jumps 15% and then jumps even more in back to back trading sessions. 

It usually balances out. Maybe it doesn't. I'm just waiting to see at this point.That's why all of us love it...our calls extend through the year...if we lose I will single handedly deliver a hustler giftcard for your wife and her fat boyfriendand yet rewarded for it anyway.Looks like you are replying to someone who bought contracts this time aroundPersonally, I'm staying out of Intel until I see those changes taking place. And I think shorting them is also too risky - as long as they dominate in market share, their fortunes will improve if the CPU market improves.

They do make good quality CPUs and networking hardware even if their performance isn't the best anymore. Lots of brand power and a good software team. But if they don't unfuck their foundry situation in 3 years or so they are done.Intel fell behind AMD a year ago. They are just falling further behind.Technologically they are way behind the AMD/TSMC team in almost every possible segment, and in most cases by a wide margin. They still have (marginally) the best gaming CPUs which are also expensive and inefficient. Their platform has a reputation for stability which carries weight in enterprise but it won't last long.

It's going to be a long time before AMD challenges Intel in market share, probably a couple of years at least. They're maybe 10-20% depending on segment, we may get an update this week at QE.

Intel has good margins now, but semis are a very punishing industry if you sell the second-best silicon. That margin could evaporate fairly soon. Intel and TSMC are pretty much at full capacity but it could get ugly if the work-from-home bump tapers off over the next year.Okay, round two: it didn't like the title length so I had to repost. I realized that I had written a gignatic amount in response to you, so I made a DD post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hxpfqv/intel_dd_dependant_on_amds_10qk_it_may_be_time_to/?). Lets continue this discussion in there.>This could've been AMD's moment where they're seen as a "Tesla" stock

I don't think they're at that level yet. The FOMO was heavy, but the managed way that their stock was moved Thursday (down from $61 to $58, then immediately up to $62 after market close) after a massive call sweep was purchased at $60 for OPEX shows that this could all be a grift on both companies by a large firm.

TSLA has strength because they've created a holistic brand around Musk. Space travel, futuristic battery cars that can dance, etc... AMD just became king of the processor mountain, and I don't think that's as marketable as a 3.2 second 0-60 Model S launch from a stop light.Okay, well then I will strike that from the list above.Arithmetic 🤣🤣 jesus Cosmo....they need to make shirts with the WSB guy holding an abacusThis is the way..Playing the long game 😏You are indeed my friendYou should start a community with that lineWe've known in r/pcmasterrace that Intel's reign was gonna end the day they announced ryzen.It was actually my first trade ever too, lol. 

I was like 16 at the time and just set up my TDA account and my dad had told me a few tickers to buy for the long haul, long story short I bought AMD and AMZN. After seeing 15% I thought I’d be a genius and sell it and find the next months 15% runner, luckily I’m still holding the amazon.2016 was a good year. It was the year of AMD, NVAX, and of course DRYS.Haha, Yeah I'll take that all into consideration. I've been looking for a play since the June 26 crash stole my tendies. Been doing good in SPACS instead but ready to regain my shit in the WSB gameIntel prob countered with backend dealings we don’t know about tho

Ie. payments to Dell and other OEMsAlso they laid off their engineers a few years back... that's kind of important since they forgot what they do for a living.Yes, and i stated that very clearly that custom PCs were a small part of the industry, and that intel's core revenue comes from PC manufacturers like Dell and Lenovo. I then stated that this is the concern, as this is the very revenue that is at risk by Intel's 3 year 7nm failure.

Thank you for saying everything I said back to me and calling me an autist.That's why I wrote this huge post about how AMD beat Intel to 7nm chips by a solid 3 years, which puts those sales to Dell, hp, Apple, etc at a huge risk.

This is literally why their stock dropped.Get a load of this guy.  You don't get it, I tried posting in this SUB when AMD was 6 dollars a share when their ryzen tech was just getting leaked.  Then intel in 2016 still hasn't delivered 10nm as promised and then leaks saying their whole production was delayed.  Intel's fabs that were transitioning to 10nm were reserved to be put back to 14nm nodes. They fired their CEO and used sexual misconduct as the cover story.  Inside of Intel they are just riding the gravy train from their success with core,  but people do but realize you can't throw money magic wand and develop a proper node. 

Intel is a monster but buying into AMD was the most obvious easiest decision to make free money in 2016 in my entire life. What was a surprising windfall is just how long intel continue to fuck up their 10nm production.  They still don't have a mass production 10nm mode.  While AMD found a way to increase yields per wafer ingeniously because they are chiplets.

People think AMD is only gaining traction in DIY market but this couldn't be more false. AMD is taking market share from Intel in laptops as well as servers all the while the TAM for AMD and Intel is increasing. People don't understand why AMD keeps just "meeting" expectations of eps or a 1 to 3 cents eps beat. 

Lisa Su has been taking all the extra money and sending it straight onto R&D. they are the underdog,  their is a reason their earnings report is so obscured. 

Also I think in 2019 out 2018 Intel restructured their earnings report so they would mask their loss in certain sectors(high end and server computing) by gains in higher revenue but lower margin sectors(sectors amd doesn't compete in)

This has been THE MOST transparent fall from grace and rise of the underdog ever for two publicly traded companies.  Its so fucking obvious.  3700% in 5 years on AMD from just shares. I was screaming from the rooftops in 2016 to everyone I could.  I'm glad my parents and brother trusted enough to listen.  And a few people from work.  The rest of these poors just laughed and said Intel is god.Mmm...hmmm... 

This isn't some technical drop, it's a fundamental drop. It's not a single institutional investor dropping the market so it can buy back in after the weekend and results in a recovery of a third of the drop. Or a result of panic selling. This is a company going down at least somewhat.Good thing literally no one thinks or has said this.Intel is only king in consumer PCs because PC manufacturers like Dell and Lenovo are still buying wholesale from Intel.

If you look at actual sales of consumer-boxed CPUs, AMD is absolutely dominating. But, of course, this is a small part of the market. 

But again the issue is 7nm architecture. It doesn't matter what happened last year. It matters what is going to happen when Intel is literally 3 years behind AMD on 7nm.Actually, making their own shit has been working out horribly for Intel. It’s the reason they have been falling behind. From what I hear, only a tiny fraction of the current 10nm chips they make are even sellable due to production issues and wouldn’t be surprised if there are further delays on 7nm.

I have no idea why people  (okay I do, it’s because they don’t know better or have really bad judgement) would play INTC at their current state because let’s say they finally do get 7nm going? And then what? Basically you’re saying the stock will go up when the their best case scenario is that they will stop fucking up and catch up to AMD. Also, they stated that if they can’t get their chip fab together, they do have secondary contingency plans to outsource chip fab. Guess who the only company that has the capability undertake such a task is? TSM. So why, why, why, would you want to put money into INTC when TSM is sitting there, heavily undervalued with huge growth potential, with much less risk.Because they have shit yields even on their ancient 14nm.Hardly a fair comparison since the 10900K launched during a pandemic that is causing supply shortages across the board whereas AMD's 3rd gen Ryzen launched last year.  The upcoming 4th gen Ryzen will be a more apt comparison.he wrote an essay explaining you and you straight ignore it you retard. you didn't get his point. fucking idiot.Exactly, lol. AMD and Nvidia won that battle and create all the CPUs and GPUs for next-gen gaming consoles.

Just another missed revenue stream for Intel.Jim Keller? He left Intel in June for "personal reasons"Less power and lower price are THE  whole fucking competition in a lot of markets and Intel's not winning any part of the battle anymore. [https://www.pcworld.com/article/3567204/amds-ryzen-4000-g-series-chips-arrive-but-the-company-promises-youll-want-the-next-chip-instead.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3567204/amds-ryzen-4000-g-series-chips-arrive-but-the-company-promises-youll-want-the-next-chip-instead.html) 

I like to back my claims up.You managed to make a comment purely made of false statements, congratulations.Because the market is forward looking ya dingus, why do you think they posted that growth and tanked 16%?Hedgeye's real-time trade alerts signaled a buy on QQQ in the morning and coiledspringcap (on twitter) has some TA suggesting a rally next week among the indices. Both are usually pretty bearish so that has me nervous for next week. That said it really all hinges on big tech's earning reports next - if there are any significant misses it might be a pretty huge blow to the market. I'm not sure how long we can keep up this insane juicing of tech where 22% of SPY consists of five companies - but then again, even the people calling this a bubble are saying that bubbles can last an insane amount of time, and trying to call tops is gonna make you broke. I keep being more bearish than bullish and I've really only lost money since the March crash (goddamn put massacre of the 220 range) - perma-bull in this market with long positions and hedges seems to be the way to go.Waiting to see and sitting cash is the smart money play with the way the market is right now, imo. That said, the run-up on even smaller tech the past couple weeks (cough - Spotify - cough) has me seeing another massive move next week as an absolutely likely outcome. My brain says nah, but my puts say guh.> your wife and her fat boyfriend

This is the one dumb financial decision I've never made. Just deliver the Hustler giftcard to my boyfriend.Yeah, when I sold all my AMD $57 options at around $68.50, that I was fully intending to exercise, I was afraid that this run-up was nothing but stock manipulation and it'll soon crash down 10-15% after ER day, it happened on the last ER, where I got burned holding the bag on the way down........  Hoping at least some of that is the case again, and the stock price drops into the low to mid 60s by end of week, so I can get back into AMD for the long haul.    


You can't market CPU and GPU cores like a Tesla, but I'm hoping AMD can capitalize on the release of the PS5, with some co-branding deal with Sony, as the guts of what makes Next-gen games possible.Seriously, can we come up with some WSB tshirt? That would be dope!A bundle of sticksOne already exist, too lateNot to mention when they delayed 10nm. Delaying 7nm for 2-3 years is... devastating.Um. No. Ryzen was good but only close in performance to Intel. Zen2 was fantastic but if Intel's 10nm wasn't a disaster and Intel 7nm launched with an advanced architecture before Zen3, they would have been neck and neck at worst.Nah there were plenty of AMD-deniers, mostly Intel cucks :phere to for AMD first trade too ever on robinhood. i always bought and played AMD in my computers. why not invest in what youre passionate for? bought 20 shares at like 82 cents i think. all i could afford at the time being hard on my luck. 

found a better job later on and bought some more because i felt good about it seeing numbers all rising. for over like4-5 years ive been holding and now im at 160 shares @ $6.79. total return so far as of today is 923%

of all the things in my life.... if i could go back in time it would to be put that whole $750 savings i had into AMD and not just $20.


edit: i also dont know what im doing im sure ive squandered thousandths away just sitting here making some chump change. anyone wanna tell how ive fucked up?Trippin down the memory lane..I just wanna say, I love your handle!!“Huge risk”...only they beat their fucking earnings during covid fucked economy.

Look, long term...its anyones fucking guess what will happen but the writing is on the wall for intel to stop falling asleep at the wheel.

Theyre the rich trust fund fuckers and have daddys money to bail them out when they get fucked (for now).

Theres a buying opportunity to make a quick buck on this. I think for the majority here, thats all we care aboutThere is no chance of the corporate sector buying AMD hardware from the large PC manufacturers.  They are all welded to Intel and have been for decades, regardless of AMD v Intel performance or what node their chips are based on.  Apple have dropped Intel though for their own Apple branded chips, not to switch to AMD.Where do you think we go this year with amd? $100 possibly?I never said that AMD was a bad investment, just that they will not be overtaking Intel for the foreseeable future.  You'd be kidding yourself if you think otherwise.  AMD isn't anywhere near the size of Intel in any metric whatsoever.And Intels dominance in consumer cpus has always been in laptops. Desktop are a dying breed. Amd weakness was they had garbage laptop cpus but they solved that shit this year with renoir which absolutely destroys intel in performance and battery life.AMD is the single biggest meme stock ever behind Tesla. 

You’re not wrong about anything you’ve said. But that’s the point you’re missing. Intel still dominates the business world of computer processors through mass volume. It’s like comparing the quality of your local mom n’ pop restaurant to McDonald’s.

Sure the quality is probably better at the mom n’ pop. But nobody cares when it’s a fraction of the market compared to McDonald’s running game around the world. 

AMD might be the frontrunner... like 7-10+ years from now. But for now, he’s not wrong. Intel dipping puts it under its average trading evaluation of shares. It’ll go back up and buying calls for the near future is a strong and easy bet.

Saying it’s not just makes you guys the cornerstone of WSB honestly lmao. AMD has been hailed to have a meteoric rise in value all year, and now that it’s come months later, we’re tap-dancing circles claiming it’ll rocket “unexpectedly” like the next Tesla or Amazon as it supposedly takes over the computer processing market?

 The truth is, it’s still not going to be recognized for the value you all think it will anytime soon. Do what you want, it’s your money. Meanwhile, some of us won’t have to wait over half a year for a payout after being wrong and in the red for months, we’ll take the easy and consistent profits week in and week out, building a real portfolio.It is important to note that Intel's larger chips are as good or better than AMD's 7nm. AMD has to be *constantly* improving or they just fade away because Intel's brand name, performance and quality are so strong. They continue to be the premium option, and everyone wants the best even if they can't afford it. If you're buying for a gaming rig, you're buying Intel. If you're buying for servers, you're buying Intel. 

The trouble Intel is having right now might lead to issues down the road. But for now, and for the immediate future, they're going to show better growth than tech companies like Microsoft or Apple. This quarter kind of proved that. This is not to say they won't lose market share to AMD, especially in the desktop market. If AMD's new line is better performance in addition to the power savings, then people are going to buy it in droves because it'll almost certainly be cheaper too. But server upgrades are much less frequent, and Intel has time on those.I'm talking about gaming. Intel's current 14nm chips still beats AMD 7nm chips in performance , smaller doesn't mean better.Maybe it has something to do with the fact that INTC went down 18% from overreaction. I'm only in INTC for the short term gains. Why the hell would I go into TSM after it went up 10% today? I'm out of INTC once it goes up 10%+.When the boomer 14nm technology is still beating a zoomer 7nm technology in raw performance hahaha.Consoles are shit margin, that's why AMD takes them, Intel and Nvidia don't typically care about the business.I almost forgot switch existedAnd i meant that they haven’t had a marketshare to begin withThose chips hasn't even come out yet and they are comparing it to last gen chips. By the time those chips are for sale for DIY consumers , Rocket Lake or Intel's 10nm chips would be released.Yeah I'm about 40% cash right now. Completely out of margin... Of course I wish I had stayed on margin with 100 shares of AMD I sold Monday now worth about $1200 more lol.Multiple...I would definitely wear one with the WSB guy wearing a multicolored propeller hatIf I had wheels I would be a bicycle.YouTube comments are full of itCovid fucked economy making everyone use tech... If anything Intel should be doing better than normal right now.as an entirely AMD investor for the last 4 years, AMD is an extremely beta stock. Very very sensitive to general market trends. Also lisa su doesn't fluff the analysts. She doesn't try to pander to the shareholders. They will probably announce a small beat or meet on expectations.  Historically the stock drops after earnings, like sharp decline.  I'm not sure if that trend will continue but if I were holding 100 dollar leaps for 1 to 2 years out i would be comfortable as fuck with it.  Shares i would feel good to.  Unless china invades Taiwan and destroys tsmc, Then AMD has nothing to worry about.  I'm not guessing hard numbers here but r/amd_stock would serve you better in that regard..a lot of the people who predicted this current eps are now crunching numbers of 150 so at a 25 pe in late 2021 and early 2022. 

u/bionista has amazing write ups in that sub reddit.  All the trolls calling us blind fan bois slowly killed themselves as their long dated puts crashed and burned, but the sub itself is an amazing tool for AMD investors who give a shit,  and not just faggot bean counters that just want money to fall in their laps "cause the guy on wsb did it once".> AMD isn't anywhere near the size of intel in any metric whatsoever

Especially transistor size lmaoI agree intel isn't going to fall over and die, but if you're interested in companies that make processors for servers/ enterprise / desktops you have two choices AMD and Intel.  Why invest in Intel the last 4 years when AMD is positioned in an exponentially better position Intel. Now im not saying all aboard the hype train,  in my mind if people haven't been investing in AMD since it was 6-10 and choosing Intel instead,  then you're just fucking dumb. You have so little to gain in Intel shares/leaps because of the information we knew and correctly know now about their processes tech.

It's not even speculative. It wasn't speculative 3 years ago. The tech was leaked and it was known that Intel was delayed and covering up how big the fucked up.  Then the buy backs started,  meanwhile amd has been slowly diluting and its still going up because people steadily started to wrap their brains around it.  

Intel is huge and its margins are low because they do most of their silicon in house.  AMD is fabless so the real product it is selling is their brain and capability to rule the computing space in tech that performs. 

They aren't vulnerable to a fuck up in their fabs because if their 7nm manufacturer TSMC fucks up their next shrink(current information says they aren't,  and they are right on track for their next node) then they can start to position themselves with another fab company.  It's just that at the moment TSMC has the best shit out there.

Intel's fabs, originally a margin making machine, is now its ball and chain as it tries to stay competitive in the future and so forth.  The new ryzen laptops for business enterprise are absolutely monsters and amazing battery life.  This isn't about gaming and never was, its all about production performance. AMD is better for business as well.  Performance per watt(server metrics) and socket it absolutely destroys Intel. The real enemies in this is AMD's ability to get tsmc to scale space for their product and Intel's ability to bully manufactures. This isn't 2004 though,  the are too many tech enthusiasts and journalist that call them on their bullshit now.  They can't obfuscate the benchmarks without getting wrecked on the media. 

This battle was over before it even started.Defiantly not destroying Intel in the laptop market. So few laptops use them because the descisions were made a year or even 2 years ago to go with intel or AMD. Intel was obvious because they had been destroying AMD. Now though, in the low tier laptops and 2-3 mid tier laptops they’re pretty even. AMD is cheaper, but intel has better boosts and much better thermals which has always been AMDs problem. Intel right now is still on top and there is 0 completion in the high end laptop market and even mid tier stuff. Maybe in a year or two this would change but right now, renoir doesn’t destroy intel, it’s competitive wit intel.put intel cpu's are power hungry hot garbage. Its so bad that apple, a major laptop maker is no longer using intel cpu's and instead is switching to arm. So seriously, what r you saying.

Only reason theyre still surviving is because of their sheer size. amd cant produce the volume that they can. Its perms of performance or efficiency amd' beats them.>You’re not wrong about anything you’ve said. But that’s the point you’re missing. Intel still dominates the business world of computer processors through mass volume

Yes, I know. And that's why their 7nm failure puts their core business at risk. That's the uncertainty that dropped their stock. 

That is exactly my point.>If you're buying for a gaming rig, you're buying Intel. If you're buying for servers, you're buying Intel.

That's just not true. AMD now has a majority of CPU sales in the enthusiast/DIY PC market.

I'm not saying you're wrong. Intel's best chips are more powerful than AMD's best chips. I'm just saying that everyone is buying Ryzen anyway, because they are good enough and far cheaper. 

7nm isn't about gaming rigs. Gaming rigs are a tiny fraction of the consumer PC market.

7nm chips are smaller, run cooler, and are more power efficient. This is critical for laptops and ultrabooks, and I have a hard time believing that companies like Apple and Dell will just wait for Intel until 2033 when AMD has these chips now.Intel's benefit is what is screwing them. They manufacture their die in house, which obviously reduces overhead but this could lead to falling behind which is happening. People bring up that intel current chips are as good or better, but at what cost. Usually it's power consumption and integrability. Used intel for the past 10 years and had to swap out motherboards for almost every upgrade. You can use the same motherboard for the last 3-4 generations of AMD chips, including the ones that are coming out. AMD used to be Intel in the gaming community but that switched with the release of the Core 2 Duo.>If you're buying for servers, you're buying Intel. 

*Laughs in Threadripper/Epyc*

Intel shills are fucking hilarious, I swear.Well I'm not making an argument about gaming performance. I never said "AMD is better for gaming."  I just said Intel lost the custom PC market, which they did. 

Intel basically had 100% of the enthusiast/DIY desktop market. Now they have about 7%. Custom PC folks basically completely switched to AMD Ryzen. 

As for 7nm, smaller does mean better when you are a laptop manufacturer. And companies like Dell, Apple, and Lenovo *will* switch to AMD to get smaller, cooler, more power-efficient processors for their ultrabooks and whatnot.on single core performance for games that primarily use single cores. You know why games like WoW are never tested? They tend to use more cores. As developers begin to use the capabilities of more cores, this is going to change. Oh and the difference is by 4-5 frames.

\*Edit\* also, Intel uses way more power to hit that performance. 1.3V in a 10900k pulls over 300W while a ryzen uses 210W at 1.42V. Can supply sourcesThe thing is, you don’t KNOW if it’ll go up 10%. Chances are bigger that it’ll gap down over the weekend when overseas traders bail the fuck out on it. Meanwhile, you could have been  holding long calls on TSM which will almost certainly hit $100 minimum in 2021 and probably more.  

Now let’s say TSM drops due to profit taking over the weekend. All that means is that it’s a great time to buy more calls.

If INTC drops down over the weekend? It’ll just continue to plummet at open from everyone ditching a stock with abysmal guidance.Amd beats intel in all price points. And no i dont care about an extra 5 fps in games or slightly faster single threaded boomer app.TSMC started mass production of its 5-nanometer N5 node in April 2020.oof, you're braver than I - margin and spreads are two things I don't fuck with because I'm pretty sure I'd get myself margin called in seconds.You guys know they have an official redbubble in the sub details right? They sell shirts, stickers, etc.Most def! Also, it’s easier to recognize fellow autistic colleaguesIntel definitely does not have better thermals.Damn this is a bad, manipulative personSo then you agree that the stock value, after going down, will be right back up sooner rather than later. 

Great.I think Apple is moving to in-house silicon anyway, or they want to. We'll see where the consumer laptop and notebook market goes, but it's quicker to change than something like servers. If Intel gets their shit together, they can eliminate this competitive advantage AMD currently has. It's a big if, of course. I like to think it's not blind faith, and that the company has proven itself over the years.I'm just saying that as Moore's law slows, the difference in generation becomes less important relative to the difference in design/performance. If Intel's chips are comparable or better even when AMD has the size and power consumption advantage, what happens when Intel *does* make it to 7nm? I could be wrong on this, of course. I just have a lot of trust in the brand name.Epyc ftw, fellow gamerIntel still dominates the DIY market , it's not even a competition. Where the hell you get that 7% from?Obviously Ryzen uses less power since its 2 times smaller and Intel still beats AMD on multi-core performance. Intel's boomer 14nm architecture still have better bench performance than AMD's 7nm which I find funny. Now imagine when Intel finally learns how to make 7nm chips.It doesn't need to go up 10% for profit , people that got in at $50 is already up 2% , and that is free money. You also don't know TSM will hit $100.Margin is just for the shares. So I just sell shares whenever I screw up too much lol. 

Schwab makes you have enough cash for options.I'm actually autistic, why would I know thatCompared to AMD yeahYou're right, as die size decreases the benefits also decrease. Intel current plan is to have 7nm released by late 2022 or early 2033 and AMD plans to announce 5nm by 2022.  We'll have to see then if the performance is equal. I like Intel, no denying they were/are great, but AMD lighting a fire under them is a good thing overall for us consumers.Look at Intel dropping and AMD increasing in market share:

https://www.cpubenchmark.net/market_share.htmlhttps://www.tweaktown.com/news/73040/mindfactory-data-amd-is-outselling-and-smashing-intel-87-to-just-13/index.html

Where are you getting your info on Intel dominating from?You either are clueless about the custom PC industry or you're completely delusional. Do you run userbenchmark.com by any chance?> Obviously Ryzen uses less power since its 2 times smaller and Intel still beats AMD on multi-core performance.

Uh, no. Here are the top multi-core scores -- try to find an Intel processor:

https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/multicoreWhere the fuck do you see any Intel chip beating AMD in multithread?You’re right. I thought it would hit $70 instead of $100 but my leaps already printed a month after I bought them so deep in the money for TSM leaps that I was scared I wouldn’t be able to sell them and have to exercise instead. Luckily I was able to sell them for the current asking price at the time instead of the bid side of the spread.So it would seemCompletely false.True that.Desktop chips have inferior design since they're recycling skylake (remember 6000 series? same shit) but laptops have moved on. Reason why i9 has performance crown is sheer clockspeed which is the one thing their 14 nm is good at. At more moderate speeds though, intel is a little bit faster at gaming but significantly slower most other benches (that's per core and AMD can easily manufacture more cores cheaper). It is true that moving to a new manufacturing node with good yields will fix their problems though, since 14++whatever++ is only good at maxing speed on top chips and is behind everywhere else.Everyone has different numbers. Steam said only 22% have AMD CPU and many other sources also said something similar.Worldwide. Why you posting stats from a German retailer?Why the fuck you linked a benchmark system that measures server processors. I'm talking about the Intel 14nm consumer chip vs AMD 7nm consumer chip.https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/. You guys are talking about [128 cores for servers](https://www.newegg.com/amd-epyc-7742-socket-sp3/p/N82E16819113581) , and I'm talking about consumer level chips.Always does🍆TSMC started mass production of its 5-nanometer N5 node in April 2020.That's because there's still a large number of people running 2+ year old Intel CPUs and are either going to hold on for a few more years or are waiting to upgrade since the Intel CPUs then were still better than AMD's (especially the i5s). Market share is based on recent CPU sales, which, like u/StockDealer mentioned, is almost exclusively AMD. I would not be surprised to see a significant change in the Steam hardware survey results once 4th gen Ryzen releases.steam is user based not hardware based. Many users can use the same hardware and it gets double recorded. Same reason why the 1060 is still top of the list despite production ending ages ago.Because it's a legitimate sampling from a large retailer. I noticed you haven't provided ANY source to back up your claim. Where is it, or are you just operating on feelings?

EDIT: Guess who owns 1-5 of the Amazon best selling CPU's too?

https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Computers-Accessories-Computer-CPU-Processors/zgbs/pc/229189/ref=zg_m_bsnr__bsThat's the one that everybody uses for sales, just fyi.

Tell us more about how Intel will dominate.It has both. You have to keep scrolling and scrolling and scrolling to the next pages. I didn't see a single Intel chip there for what it's worth. (Scrolled more just now -- found a few. Dual sockets.)

Intel is fucked. They shouldn't have laid off their engineers a few years ago. You do understand that Intel is fucked, right?Ahh userbenchmark. The highly biased site that tried saying a 9100 was better than a 3900x. 

Fuck off with that shit.Plus the Steam survey has gone up (in AMD's favor) even since February:  https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/processormfg/

2% doesn't look like much -- but in five months? And that's not just new processors, that's all processors.I'm not going to scroll 1000 pages. The first 100 pages is all 3k processors. Okay I found a better system on the website https://browser.geekbench.com/processor-benchmarksYes, Intel is fucked isn't it?https://browser.geekbench.com/processor-benchmarks nope , boomer 14nm tech with 28 cores has the same performance as a 7nm tech with 64 coresThat's silly. You don't see any problems with that chart? Like, look at the 3990 versus the 3970. Do you think that's right?

In reality, the 3990x is at least 70% faster.

If it's some kind of boomer tech that you like, perhaps a nice 8-bit processor then.I'm using the same website you linked me to......You're on a user-submitted page which obviously has an error. (Truth be told it's probably a dual CPU system that is overclocked but even that doesn't explain the other discrepancies.)

You really think that 28 cores are as fast as 64 when the single threaded performance is roughly on par? If so, then I can't help you.Pfizer also made a big deal with the U.K. government a few days agoIt’s funny all of these other companies are down on the PFE deal besides Moderna. 

They are being pumped by some firms for sureAll of my Pfizer call options expired worthless 4 days ago...

Fuck this game the story sucks

What have I become, my sweetest fren? Every play I own, just gets bogged in the end...Who else got wiped out by AstraZenecaPfizer to the moon! Already up 300% on some $38c's I bought over a week ago. Sold off a couple to cover my buy in and letting the rest ride.  Bought 1 $36c yesterday which is up 100% today. 

Thanks to the autard who convinced me a month ago, whoever you are!This isn’t really a big deal. World governments have said they would prepurchase vaccines for months. If I remember right, AZN and NVAX had hundreds of thousands of doses bought by the EU over a month agowow. are my PFE shares finally gonna start making some money.Mrna pumpers trying to pump to indicate they are gonna get the same 😂😂 it’s funny to watch

Azn and jj most likely will get contracts too

Little guys have no proven record. If you’re going to fast track safety you’re going to bet on the big boys. No way you take a chance on shitty little ones and possibly kill thousandsHAHA I CALLED IT. Pfizer made a deal at the start of all of this with Corning for their Valor Glass in vaccine containers, aka Corning bet on Pfizer to come up with the vaccine first. Did I put anything into that? Hell no because I’m retarded, but hey at least I thought of it?There's no losing. Everyone can have a billion when the money is unlimitedMy PFE 1/2022 calls are printing!The dividend yield was so absurd in March that i doubled down on Pfizer. I'm officially a Pfizerwhore now. I measure time by the days since the last pfe payable and the days til the next one.

If they slash the dividend I slash my wrists.And Moderna still didn’t crash and burn. I am literally shockedEveryone is gonna get a contract. The US Gov is gonna buy 300m vaccines from all of the companies. Just in case it might work.Astra is the one.150 contracts of pfe bought in June. Mad cheap..... $39 strike.....7/17. FmlHow is there a deal for vaccine production when there isn't even a vaccine ready yet?I think it has a clause that it has to work and they are doing this or have done this with other companies.Mother fucking MRNA gaining bigly today" (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc has signed a long-term agreement with glass maker Corning Inc to procure vials for storing drugs "

$GLW is going to make the vialsAre my AZN 7/24 calls going in the trash this week ?So is PFe gna fk my ass like azn did too or whatAstraZ got $480mill and j&j got $350million already lmaoThe US also made a deal with AstraZeneca a few months ago. They’re making the COVID vaccine with Oxford University. Under the deal, UK gets first dibs as early as September, and US would get October.wow my Pfizer calls expired a week early niceGlad I own a shit ton of NtechSo, did they actually make a vaccine?Up 150% on my 12/18/20 calls, let’s goo PFE!Go and buys moderna puts instantlyHahahahahahahaha it hurts so goodYou guys are sleeping on EBSI don't trust fuck all anymore PFE will probably be down 30% in a monthFuck, I just sold my PFE todaylol my moderna calls didn't go through the other week so I just said fuck itWait... Did they develop a Covid vaccine, and I’m only finding this out from a WSB shitpost?LolNice! I win.Microsoft 7/24 $515 calls tomorrow at open no doubtPFE calls put in three days ago for late August...fly me to the moon like that bitch Alice KramdenI put my chips in with AZN :(Damn there goes my MRNA calls. FUCK. GG...Fun isn’t something one considers when placing bets, but this does put a smile on my face.NVAX is now an 8B dollar company.. ho-lee-fuk.. Covid was the best thing to ever happen to that shitpile stock..It's just every government grabbing at straws since they'd rather do something rather than nothing.

Give everyone a placebo to get us cattle back to work.Orders doesn’t mean they will buy.  Retards.They were always gonna lose. Pzifer lobbyists don't pay the government for nothing.Q: Does their vaccine work?  


A: Who cares?My 150 $37c 7/17 certainly lostINO.... It hurtsMy PFE calls expired worthless two days ago 🙂Hey, remember when we all yolo’d our savings on Pfizer, got scared when it went down 20%, sold, then made fun of everyone who was still in on Pfizer?

Just me?...No, they do not have a vaccine. Short that shit.i have mrna puts 

pray fo rmeThis is a preorder for a vaccine currently under tests. If it fails phase 3 trials, they switch to the next contender.

They did a [similar deal](https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/us-secures-300-million-doses-of-potential-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-120052101251_1.html) with AZN back in May but no one was paying attention.

So there are no winners or losers yet. Unlike WSB, the US government is not putting all their eggs in one basket.Fuck pfizer. Was bagholding 7/10 calls and then this mfer decides to pop after I lose 85%I wonder if my 39C will print. I'll sell for 20% just to watch them run to 200%My trading account turned to dustAm I the only autist here that made money on AZN callsDoesn’t matter. They only go up anyway.Where are my fellow losers who are balls deep in MRNA rnSo that’s why my travel shares and calls went down today....? Makes senseMy 45 PFE calls $38 10/16 I snagged a week ago are looking mighty sexy right nowMy 36C 10/16 printed today. Cashed out at 80% gain. Could have gotten more if I held but gainz is gainzUp 300% on 8/7 36.5c 🤑Astra Zeneca is the one who is furthest alongUhhh AZN has like 2 billion orders from EU. I don't think they lost.i think the assumption is that the US can force american companies to sell to it, they cant do that with foreign companies.$TSLA 2800C 7/24Time to buy Sept. MRNA puts. 

I'mma throw 10k at it.Can wait for the sequelKA-CHING!Now we just need... an actual vaccineAll of these people talking and arguing like they’re right even tho nobody knows where the markets are going 🤣I got in suckaaaaaAll of those companies already received contracts way before Pfizer.No other company  besides Johnson and Johnson have the means to manufacture as fast as Pfizer.AZN is supplying the EU with vaccines.This is what happens when you're known for making pps gro.NONE of these are making any moves stop clogging up WSB with this bullshitFirm pumps are my kinda pumps, not too hardModerna was doing good untill jpmorgan downgraded the value of their stock. Then it fell like $14/shareAnd to think I cancelled my Aug 14 $34.5 calls two weeks ago... and put it into RIGL instead. God I'm dumbBuy further out bruh. My 7/17 $40 calls were a bust, but I’m up over 80% on my October $40 callsAre you me?And you could have it all! My entire worth...

I will let you down. 

I will make you hurt.Yeah I intentionally sold out of my PFE calls yesterday because it was 2 days until expiry, slightly green and I was sick of holding it for 2 months...Sold my 7/24 34.5c last week for %50 loss. How dumb am I...Samei sold my 7/24 35.5 calls tuesday for  1.51...now they like 3.06.  but hey GAINS ARE GAINSDoesn't matter, with this news they only went up 30 centshad 50 September 18 $40 calls I had bought for $.20 and sold for $.20 a week later, on July 8.  $1.10 now at close.Same, all that good shit happens after expiration... classicGo further out less stress and you can make calmer decisions of when to sell and not panic sell from short term moves.  I bought December 35c and 40c on pfe end of June. 1 month later both were 4x, I sold my 35s and letting 40s rideYep, I was bag holding 7/17 40C...Just do the inverse of what you want to do. Or just take profits.june 2021 $50 calls were literally .25 cents. i bought one just for the hell of it. now theyre worth .83 cents. i wish i bought more.SameCancelled my 37c 8/7 a week ago. I feel bad for myself.I didnt bag hold like a scrub and left /w my 11 percent. At least now I can get my wife's BF a nice dinnerHello friend.I thought azn was that oxford vaccine company??Cut losses last night when it started to hurt too much. Saw my PFE $37 8/7 doing well and jumped ship to PFE. I think I'll make my losses back nowWhat has two thumbs, a bald spot, and is still holding AZN calls? This guuuuy.I sold and kept what little was left on my contracts... and dignity.AstraZeneca may be able to helpsold my calls on Monday and swapped to BNTX

so far so good60% down on the good news lolI got spanked by it too.It's down 6% from ATHs and youre wiped out? lolYoHeeyyyyyRight here, my calls fuckin tankedNot I. I got very suspicious when everyone on WSB started saying it was gonna moon.I’m down $4K bro 🤦🏾‍♂️ depressedI cancelled my 34.5c's that I bought at $1.87 when they didn't immediately buy. Would be up 233% but I was to much of a pu$$yYeah someone convinced me last week to buy $40c. Thanks be to them. First time in the green in 4 positions.Sell that shit! I was green on PFE vaccine news a month a go and I paper hands’d that to a $1000 lossNVAX has been one of the best buy-and-hold stocks since the initial run up from $12 to $23 then to $43. Now it's $144??Faith from the most important country in the world is a big deal for one of these pharma companies ...

Also if it mutates they can have a covid-xx vaccine yearly and new gov revenue streamLol sadly noShould have bought biontechThe US Gov already gave Moderna $500M thoIt's not the thought that counts.  It's the dollar-weighted thought that counts.Lots of us lost money waiting on PFE to do anything so you could have easily been among us.Post war germany would like to have a word with youIt will. Buy long puts.You get a contract! You get a contract! You get a contract!I hope you're right.  I'm literally banking on it.They are producing right now as if the vaccine is already approved so that on approval they will have millions to distribute.I'm reminded of the line from The Big Short, "It's like two plus two equals fish"What’d I miss?I bought the same ones. 62 of them. I think by tomorrow I will have turned 1,200 into 18k. Holding until it turns into 40k.Sell them while your up, PFE will retract. This hype won't last and this isn't a lump payment for nothing.I did too and I lost 4K on my July 31st contractsFrom Wall Street Journal: 

"Under the $1.95 billion agreement, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Defense Department will receive 100 million doses of the vaccine should it be cleared by regulators, and can also acquire an additional 500 million doses."

So yes, if Pfizer/BioNTech get FDA approval, then Uncle Sam will purchase 100 million doses (other 500 mil are optional). The only thing that would prevent the first 100M doses from being ordered would be failure to bring a vaccine to market.And I lost 4K on AZN.. 61-63 calls contract expiring July 31stWhat is Pfizer best known for?  Who does that pill benefit the most?  Does that demographic match most politicians?  

Long story short, people shorted the dick pill then got dicked by the pill.  Pfizer been hooking up politicians for decades you damn well knew those old ED motherfuckers would be hooking Pfizer up.I hope it moons againBiontech is a german company, will probably also supply EUAZN had also earmarked 100s of millions for the US. Remember, 2bn of manufacturing capacityAnd it will keep fallingYup up 120% on my 1/15 calls in less than two weeks.Funny this is that I bought those calls in August so I thought it literally couldn't go tits upWow I must have been the only one who Kept my PFE 9/18 $38 and $40 calls.  Sold most off today for about a 500% gainThis was mine. Sold all yesterday at .12 each https://imgur.com/hGu87im

GuhhhI kept 19%Yeh you're right, AstraZeneca is the Oxford Vaccine company.I’m in it to win it too...bruhI'm going to monitor it closely tomorrow. Pfizer moves like a glacier so this is uncharacteristic and could be a pump and dump on the news this morning pre market.NVAX still hasn’t run nearly as hard as MRNA.The government will absolutely not pay for more than the first dose for everyone lol. Big pharma will milk the shit out of this after the pandemic is over.

America purchasing vaccines is important, but I place more value on CEPI and the EU as they actually believe in science unlike half of our retarded country.It's positive news for Pfizer but it's definitely not bad news for any of the others. This isn't the first company the US has handed a couple billion to on preorders. We just want vials ASAP, and as long as they clear the FDA nobody really cares what name is on the label.Most important anti vax country?  lul[deleted]ResearchHopefully they get more, a $500m contract still means they’re in the hole for another $35m according to last years financials.I got pennies for my thoughts now I'm rich, see the 2020s spinning looking mean on the 6Everyone in the US backed by US military I should sayAlready own January puts and I am 90% under water. ThanksRisky, but it makes sense if you think about it from a cost/benefit analysis.I think this is how the semiconductor industry works too. I had a buddy that worked at a wafer fabrication center. They were trying to get a contract with one of the "big boys" but had to demonstrate that they could produce X wafers per month within certain tolerances. He worked there for a year and a half and the company had no contracts.I always say let's watch a scary movie on Saturday morning. Last week this movie popped up in the watch again section when I was looking for something and it hit me that this is the scariest movie of all timeNice mate, I have 10 and am kicking myself for not picking up more!It will for sureThe question now is if the German Government will force it to, or if its contract to the USA will let it.EU to the rescue!

2020 really has destroyed the Karen's and the trumpers. It's not 2016 anymore ladies and gents.

I fucking love it.Whats a good date to buy? Oct, Nov, dec or 2021 callsMaybe. Have you watched it? It seems to have stabilized for now. I guess if they get a viable vaccine it might make it go up againUp 250% on my 12/18 calls in 2 weeks also

Edit: 280%Still have my PFE 9/18 34c calls and not getting rid of them soon, those contracts alone wiped out 3 months of losses for me (made some really dumb options plays)only getting 5% return a day will take a whole year til you're a billionaireThen we should be fine !And to think, I had all of them on my watch list but was convinced it wasn’t as hot of an idea as fucking tankers.... literally, balanced between vaccine manufacturers and tankers and I bought into that fucking hypeI think NVAX has run as hard in the same time frame. Back in Feb/March NVAX was $9 while MRNA was $18. Overall I think MRNA is a better company, it has a higher market cap, more volume, and it seems to have less debt at a glance and better earnings potential but as of today the stock price is higher. 

Chart reflects that:

https://imgur.com/r23hooT😂😂😂🤦🏻‍♂️These deals are all contingent on the vaccines actually getting approved though.

It’s not like the gov is just handing out billions of dollars with no strings attached. Doesn’t seem that far fetched to believe they would do it for Moderna too

The bigger question is probably whether the smaller companies can afford to produce mass quantities of their vaccines before knowing forsure that it will eventually get approved, and therefore receive the government fundingthat's a lot of researchThe world trades in dollars. I heard a Planet Money podcast that said even ISIS uses USD lol.Wait for it. Just wait. Trust me.Also helps that they are all receiving a lot of government/private funding to cover potential lossesIt’s all good! You bought some and that’s what matters! Earnings are in a 6 days... I am hoping they give some more positive info regarding the vaccine then and we will be printing!!!!My contracts expire on July 31st for 61-63 Call. This has been a horrible week for me I’m down 4K as a rookie investor.AZN vaccine likely to market first so probably a moot point.German govt don't force anyoneFor real though. Natural selection at its finest. Qannon believers are being told that the vaccine will have a chip in it so they can go ahead and weed out those week minded geneticsYou can create a false reality that your supporters will believe but real reality doesn't give a shit about your fake reality and will eventually stomp all over it.  Trump couldn't misinformation away the virus.  And we should take this lesson to understand that no amount of political bullshit talk will make climate change stop happening.Someone is holding it at $80. Know if it breaks it’s a free fall to $60You selling or holding? I'm considering selling half and letting the other half ride. Doesn't matter much for me as I only have two....Up 500% on December 45c, prob gonna sell todayBro. Take some profit before you lose your shirt.[This is the best article I've read on the different vaccines](https://www.statnews.com/2020/07/20/study-provides-first-glimpse-of-efficacy-of-oxford-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine/), worth a readYou bought tankers lol. SHIP TOPS or CTRM? I remember when Yates was pumping CTRM a few weeks ago on an offering play when they had another offering the day after he pumpedI owned a bunch of NVAX at $10 and then sold it at $11 lmfaoShare price doesn’t matter, NVAX has 1/6 of the float of MRNA, and under 1/3 the market cap. Both companies are unprofitable biotechs, with 0 products on the market. A quick look at both companies debt says that NVAX has roughly 300 million in debt and MRNA has 150 million. For a company with the leading Covid vaccine, and a phase 3 approval, something MRNA doesn’t have, I would think that NVAX market cap should be at least half of MRNA which would have NVAX trading at ~280.

Furthermore, MRNA has 0 products that have made it past phase 2 trials, and NVAX has a successful phase 3 trial for a new flu vaccine that’s valued as a 1 billion+ vaccine if they get approval. Furthermore, they’re received over a half a billion funding for their Covid vaccine than any other company, and according to my analysis, as well as many analysts have the most effective vaccine. Their phase 1/2 trial is due in a week, but their preclinical trials showed up to 10000x the amount of neutralizing titers than the other candidates.

MRNA has also been horribly sketchy with insiders offloading shares every time they get a pump on the news. They don’t even believe in their own vaccine on 100% unproven technology. I’m not an antivaxxer, but I definitely don’t feel comfortable taking the worlds first RNA vaccine that has been fast tracked like this.> It’s not like the gov is just handing out billions of dollars with no strings attached. 

Yes it isThey didn’t after reviewing phase 1

Maybe Moderna will surprise. But seems like they are in back of the pack and gov will fast tract the other ones even with less safe results just go get something out there. They are gonna trust big companies more

Moderna has so many bag holders right now they are trying hard to hold $80. I give it maybe today 

After this news and continued insider selling only boiler room shops buying at this levelThey don't produce shit. They research and partner with a producer.The guy running the US vaccine effort is an ex-Moderna board member. Former chair, in fact. I think Moderna will be fine.Edit: I'm an idiotFirst to market won't mean shit when you need 6 billion vaccines produced at a minimum. That's assuming you also get complete immunity from one dose which is still up in the air. Multiple companies will be producing and selling this vaccine.Except for that one time...Interesting I'll keep watching for sure. I got out just in time. No losses but didn't keep my gainsI’m holding. I think Pfizer is gonna win the race. They cured erectile dysfunction bro. Curing COVID is a walk in the park compared to thatOh that was a good read, will hold my calls lmao.STNG, EURN, DHT, TNP, FRO, all stocks, calls outstanding on DHT.


Bag holding like a motherfuckerNVAX also has a terrible history of failure. Shares dropped from $250 to $2 after their RSV vaccine succeeded in early tests and failed in large human trials. Messenger RNA also could be a better approach than nanoparticle tech. Hard to say.As I said MRNA is likely a better company but I don't give a shit about any of that. The stock for both is floating on the potential of a coronavirus vaccine and it's all just made up money and gambling. If there is a successful vaccine released, nobody will remember the #2 company that comes up with the second coronavirus vaccine.This is the wayThe rally today that ended at 84 and fell to 82.50 AH was very telling off where this will end up tomorrow at open. I think retail is realizing that they are bag holding and institutions aren’t buying up shares anymore. Also that insiders are all but done with this one.It really doesn't matter who gets to the vaccine first. PFE probably won't be able to scale up manufacturing for COVID-19 in time. JNJ would probably manufacture the vaccine, no matter who gets to the vaccine first. They're one of the few pharma that has enough manufacturing power to distribute a vaccine.Yeah but Moderna has backers at the highest level of the US government. Their ex-chairman is basically leading the effort. Moderna is also racing through trials faster than any other company, which means there should be multiple news-based pumps yet to come. Personally I don’t play vaccines anymore but BNTX, MRNA and AZN would be my top three with NVAX a distant fourth and INO not even a consideration.The guy you are referring to is not running the vaccine effort, he can only provide advisory information to the panel of decision makers. At best he can help pump MRNA by showing preference **only at the subjective level**. Beyond that, when it comes down to picking a winner (i.e. comparing vaccine results at significant sample sizes) showing preference to MRNA is untenable because of actionable legal reprehensibility.

TL;DR: He *may* help pump, but can’t stop the inevitable dumpThis is for AZN (AstraZeneca)Did you read the previous comment? He is specifically talking about Germany. AZN has committed to supplying Europe first, and they will be the first to market, so there will probably be no need for the government to force Biontech to supply Germany first. I'm quite aware that multiple companies/vaccines will likely end up working on the global supply.I'm not even going to be signing up for any vaccine for at least a year after it goes out. Needs to run its course and actually go through some real-life testing. If everyone starts dropping dead after 6 months, I'll be watching my puts print.You know we're never getting a vaccine, right?Actually two times...Though with ED people could just lose weight, sleep better, and exercise more instead of taking a pill...

You're right! Pfizer it is!I've read around a bit on the different vaccines. According to this [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-20/astrazeneca-vaccine-data-appear-less-competitive-analysts-say), 'analysts' believe that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has produced \*relatively\* crap results compared to other COVID vaccine front-runners, such as BioNtech-Pfizer. In my opinion, the article and it's reasoning are fucking laughable. Not only did the studies use significantly different sample sizes (Oxford testing on 1,077 to BioNtech’s 60) but the article says at the end, and I quote, “each company used different convalescent groups, so comparison is not possible”, which completely nullifies the whole point of the fucking article. Convalescent groups being the base line against which vaccine effectiveness is compared. 

Even so, the financial gain investors are betting on are unlikely to be realised [directly.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/investing/shares/dont-buy-astrazeneca-shares-covid-19-vaccine-says-25bn-investor/) And although there is potential for indirect financial gain through 'positive brand exposure', pharmaceutical companies don't tend to deal directly with consumers but rather deal with governments and private healthcare providers (who I hope are more concerned with objective data than branding when purchasing). This whole saga is just re-enforcing my conception that markets are ill informed and highly speculative.Yeah I took profit on monday and then rolled my calls out for late august on the dip.lol. The more you knowThe RSV failure was a hit, but the data was still moderately positive, and injecting mothers earlier in pregnancy is a possible future path, as well as using Matrix-M which wasn’t available in 2016. Also RSV is a notoriously tricky disease, so tricky that Johnson & Johnson scrapped their vaccine after a failure.Their share price was also elevated at that time due to their Ebola vaccine progress which was scrapped because only 3 people in the US got it so there wasn’t a market.That’s not true though. None of the companies are planning on making any more than 1 billion vaccines by the end of next year. There’s 8 billion people on the planet, and world governments are paying the piper as its far cheaper than the destruction wrought by closing the economy. Furthermore, there is an EXCELLENT chance that NVAX has positive results next week, as most analysts as well as world governments predict. They even have a stock option program for their executives that is rewarded upon positive phase 2 results that they announced today. If you don’t want to go long for 6 months that’s fine, but it’s a pretty easy play for the next several weeks which is all I was originally saying. I’ve been long with shares since $8 and calls since May and pocketed over 40k so far.

MRNA is a shady ass company with no product using unproven tech, I don’t know why you would think they’re a better company than the one that just passed a phase 3 trial for the most effective flu vaccine ever. MRNA is 100% a gamble, but if NVAX failed they’re still slightly undervalued by the peak sales estimates of Nanoflu...I agree and more and more articles come out pointing out aggressive inside selling and how this crazy price all hinges of them actually getting a vaccine out and making a ton off of it. Slim chanceThe fact that you didn’t include the the leader on part with azn , which is pfe tells me everything. 

Racing through yes cause they did a small 45 person 

A 30k trial will expose themDamnit I'm sorry. Thought I was in a different thread. AZN will be fine if you play it long enough. I have 40 AZN Jan 2022 calls. I'm longing it.You realize before you will even get the vaccine it will have been given to thousands right?  You should consider researching the phases of vaccine trials.

It won't be available for general public until late November early December if they are lucky and expedite EVERYTHING. 

All side effects are already known based on the phase 1 and 2 trials.  A vaccine would contain nothing that would kill you months down the road so effects would be known rather quickly.  The only thing that must be figured out is length of immunity. 

Im an autistic biochemist who works in vaccine r&d.Classic fucking bear, I’m all for bear genocideI'd beg to differ but what do I know.Well I ain't going for a super long term play here.  The next batch of "amazing" news I'm selling.  I personally think the vaccine will come very late into the game.We’ll see what happens. That payout structure for NVAX execs (even if their Covid vaccine fails) leaves just as bad a taste in my mouth as MRNA’s insider selling. I bought NVAX shares last year because of their flu drug, so I had a lucky early entry when Covid hit. Personally I think MRNA has the more appealing pipeline but market cap already reflects it.I wonder how much the failed shutdown has cost so far compared to a successful onePFE and BNTX are working together, please read a little more closely.I sold everything and I’m down 6K, the contracts expire on the 31st. This week killed me I’m calling it quits.I commend you - you should get back to solving covid after you've longed your vaccine stocksYou can be the guinea pig - roast bitchThe payout structure makes my 8/21 calls feel great, long term it may not pay out, but I think it’s definitely the next vaccine runner. I hope we can agree INO sucksDon’t even pay attention to their ticker. As id never be dumb enough to buy one of these small companies without a pipeline of products and risk it all on Moderna who haven’t produced a product in ten yearsYeah good call. Short plays on AZN aren't likely to pay off. Good luck in the next wave. Buy at these dips. They are great deals. If you want to be safe, wait till EOD tomorrow to see what direction the market is moving.I don't fuck with coronavirus stuff.  More  influenza, norovirus mainly but sometimes hpv and rsv.Yeah I would never touch INO. Not sure about NVAX bring the next runner since it has gone from $6 to $146 in six months. That makes it THE runner so far and by a big margin. I do like that the market cap is still 1/4th MRNA’s, though we are so divorced from fundamentals. I fully expect BNTX, NVAX and MRNA to double by September.So should I congratulate you on missing out on the massive gains MRNA, NVAX etc. have provided over the last few months? Very little of this has to do with fundamentals or logic. I personally don’t touch any of these vaccine stocks anymore (except for holding PFE and AZN shares in long-term accounts) but that’s largely because I bought them early and have already seen +2500% returns. The reason I listed BNTX first is because it offers the same upside but its partnership with Pfizer mitigates the risk. And ten year development cycles are hardly outliers with bleeding edge biotech. Pfizer is counting on the same unproven over ten years tech to work.I had covid and norovirus and noro was waaaaay worse for me. Also, dont you think trump pulls a "cure" from the hat the week before the election? This one might be dubious considering his track record with hydroxychlI don’t know. A week ago, MRNA had the exact same catalyst that NVAX has in the next 7 days and they gapped from 70ish up to like 94 (can’t confirm exact price right now). Positive results from NVAX, which look likely, I can see a gap up to ~200, which will probably settle in the 170-180 range, but that’s why you buy calls before the spike.That’s why it’s a pump and dump. Fun on the way up ...

But all will crash besides the big onesAnyone saying they have a "cure" for as virus is down right lying. Viruses because of their inherent biological nature do not have cures except one's own immune system. There are only drugs that can reduce symptoms or cause it to lay dormant.  Vaccines simply boost our immune system to recognize the virus and create an immune response before it's hijacked too many cells and done its damage. 

Even if they started TODAY you are looking at a minimum of 4 months for phase 3 to complete and the data to be compiled sent in to regulatory agencies for review and approved and that's with it all being fast tracked.Yeah I may get fucked in the ass but at least I see confetti and emojis after I lose all my money on a tradeSoak my clown nose in cocaine and gin before each trading day.Call me bozo cause the only person I'm clowning is myself by still using this shit tier trading platform🟢Fidelity🟢 gang rise upYo they about to raid deutschebankSerious question why do people choose robinhood?No love for E*TRADEI just started trading and Robinhood is easy to use for me.i take it chase and e trade are cut out cus they're too fat and clunky and still running over.

The only issue is fractional shares are limited to S&P 500 stocks, and their charts are either ok (desktop) or horrible (mobile app).What don't you like about Schwab?

Fill speed is a big thing for me.  Paying 69c per contract is fine for me.  I love Robinhoods UI though - options pricing is so easy to look at.  I actually shop on RH and then order on Schwab.I see random downtime during trading hours due to stupid mistakes by the developers as a pretty big issue. Other than that, yeah I agree. It’s the perfect place to start. I just wouldn’t be too comfortable doing any serious trading in thereRobinhood is only good for selling covered calls and cash-secured puts, going long on calls or puts, or simple stock trading.

Ameritrade app has garbage charts but the L2 data and options chain are displayed better.My experience has been nothing but excellent they have 2 different customizable platforms both completely free and I don’t pay anything in commissions. 
I also trade with Fidelity and Etrade is just easier to use and offers more tools while Fidelity may have a better news and research areas I like etrade more. I havent used the others but I am always surprised more ppl dont mention it mayb someone on here knows some areas they lack? I cant see Schwab or AT having anything Etrade doesnt Ive been on Etrade for 10+ years Fidelity for 6-7Ahh I see.It's their mobile app and website that I'm talking about.

No fees on trades, $0.65 for options, only actual bad thing I've noticed so far regarding fees is $45 for certain mutual funds but that's for peasants anywayIt’s 3 trading days. But then it takes another 3-4 business days to go into your bank account. Then another 3-4 days for it to go into your new brokerage. It’s a bitch of a moveThat's because you're trading on a Margin accounttbh I’ve never had any problems with itExcept when it comes to options. Robinhood is the only broker with commission free options.That’s cuz SCWB mobile sucks lol. Hopefully their merger with TDA will net them TOSDoesn't TD also go down during trading hours sometimes? Not familiar with the platform, just remember seeing some memes about it earlier this year.

Based on the frequency of the complaints, it does seem to be a more prevelent RH problem regardless.Hey fellow coder! Screen size does not matter. Simplicity and ease of use is even more important for complex systems. Users should have the ability to focus on their task, without having to spend time on other things. Simplicity is efficient! Intuitive UI, familiar commands and work flow can help. It is the philosophy while designing the human-machine interface, not removing functionality. This is equally important, no matter if you design a phone app or an airplane autopilot system for example. Less steps to perform the initial task, means less errors and more focus on the actual work. 

I have a first hand experience of how bad things can turn when you have to work on a system, with bad documentation and non existent support from the developers.Checking it out now, thanks for the tipWhile singing "Ignition" lolIs webull better?The best thing about IB is their margin. Most trade types aren't free like on those shitty brokers, but margin is cheap as fuck.

And of course you aren't scammed on spreads...Power E-Trade is the best web platform I ever used.Thanks for the feedback. Schwab is known for their amazing customer service. I also like how I can view Morningstar reports there (have a Schwab account to see what lies ahead when my TD Ameritrade account becomes a Schwab account). Not a great phone app though.

TD Ameritrade is said to have the best desktop trading platform around (thinkorswim), and it has served me quite well. If Schwab keeps that asset when they ultimately implement the merger, then it'd be tough to leave.

But I'm also going to look into Etrade. Thanks again.I actually day traded TD Ameritrade's stock today I want to trade fidelity stock but FNF(Fidelity's ticker)seems to be some insurance crap and doesn't have anything to do with their stock platform or brokerage and stocks are hot right now if it's trending this hard they are bound to make good profit and sales.Tbf you were coming from USAA which was notoriously dog shit. I know cause my dad had one of his accounts there and hated it. He showed me it one time, it had by far the worst UI I’ve ever seen. Anything would be better after that experience.I don’t get this and everyone says it. My buying power on RH is withdrawable the next day after closing a position, and then is in my CU either the following day or the 2nd day after. So 3 total, max.So how do i get my money back in my checking account? It keeps telling me i can only transfer $0Poor fills, down time, glitches, nearly non-existent customer service, lack of tools are likely the reason for that.I’m gonna be honest here: I don’t know. If it does, it has never affected me and I trade (aside from a month break here or there) daily. Definitely no broker is without sin. But I think RH is the worst in that respect. ToS has never gone down for forgetting about a leap year AFAIKI do not get that last bit of luxury (not supporting). I work with my clients to develop for their needs. Larger systems certainly include many aspects that must have explanation provided. SSMS, VS, PS, Quickbooks, and others cannot be expected to just be "straight forward" in use with the myriad of offerings presented. Yes - simplicity makes things easier.... once things get very granular that doesn't always present itself as an option (or being able to run on a 4" screen). It is impossible for me to pass a post\reply that says "RH has the BEST UI\UX" without objecting. It doesn't. Just because it makes something "easy" for "someone" doesn't make it good... it is just good for that user(s). Me? I want a much more advanced interface + backend for something like finance(s). I'm sure my platform preference is too simplistic for others desiring even more features\functionality. An overgrown chat program is a big turn off to some of us.... but to each his own I guess.Yeah charts and indicators on mobile are so much bettet on Webull. Good luck.I’ve used both(just to fuck around with, ToS is my main account) and if you’re trying to upgrade your trading experience, I would just skip on past webull. The interface seems like it could be good but it’s just not usable for my style (just clunky and over designed IMHO, and I hate the charts on there). I’d highly recommend ToS. Their mobile app is rad. And I’ve heard tastyworks is phenomenal for options I just haven’t tried it yet.I don't fw options and I trade more on technicals (ban Inc) but Webull has better charts and a desktop app. They were the broker I used when I first started. Pretty sure they also offer access to level 2 for a premium. Not sure how they are with options though.It links anywhere from 3-6 reports depending on the stock enough reports to keep you busy for days on some stocks Argus,  Reuters ,Credit Suisse, Smart consensus, market edge ect.Huh never thought of investing in a firm. I presume Robinhood would be atrociously dangerous.LOL very trueDo you have the debit card? After I got it my funds seemed to self fasterWhen was the last time you made a trade?I mean I don’t use them lol, I’m a Schwab/TD man. But its a lie to say everyone is commish free when the major investment tool utilized by 90% of this sub to lose money is only commish free on Robinhood.Judging by past comments I’ve seen ToS have outages as frequently as RH, but I could be wrongRobinhood is not publicly traded probably for a reason hard to find a good publicly traded brokerage.I mean yes, but I just got it last week. For over a year RH has always settled day after and withdrawn the following day. Maybe it’s my credit union being quick af on the withdraw (navy fed), but still wouldn’t explain why my funds have ALWAYS seemed to settle/be withdrawable day after. Weird, but I’m not complainingToday

But it wouldn’t recognize my $100 buying power from yesterday as an option to withdrawalI have TOS, TD, robinhood of the three TD’s fucked me the mostStock trades take three days to settle, in the meantime you are trading on an interest free loan given by your broker. The loan is repayed when the money from your previous trades comes in. Your bank however, is not in the business of giving these free loans so you must have settled cash to withdraw.Isn’t ToS owned by TD?Yeah I mean if you’re separating the TDA app and the ToS app..... I’ve never tried to trade through the TDA app, don’t plan on it, and don’t know why you would. ToS has never fucked me but as always, YMMVYes but they have separate apps the td is kinda of bastard child**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

Been working well.[deleted]NGL this is a pretty sweet listHope you get your cheap insurance while you canjesus bears and bulls are just as insufferable as each other during their time in the limelightThe fed started expanding the balance sheet last week in time for earnings season.

Once again, people ignore the balance sheet and then are shocked when stocks go up lol.

The fed stopped expanding it around June 3, the S&P then started trading sideways between 3000 and 3200 for over a month.

The fed began expanding last week and bam, S&P 3250, earnings and guidance for 2020 be damned. You simply cannot beat this level of asset inflation.

I welcome all the comments to tell me why the fed does not pump stocks, and why the balance sheet expansion the last 10 years has nothing to do with the bull market / bubble of the last 10 years. I will sit back and collect my risk free money, while you tell me I am wrong.RemindMe! 1 year "this is how it felt"This should be auto-reply to all bear postsyou're missing foreclosure/eviction tsunamiI’m curious... Typically you can’t predict the market but I felt like with COVID looming the first time around in March, it seemed it was obvious we would have a market collapse with many businesses shutting down and people cutting hours or being unemployed... With these current spikes in COVID being reported and businesses closing down again, I can’t help but believe we’re going to see another dip. Thoughts?When the Fed stops printingWall Street doesn’t need to make sense.   Reality is the markets should crash.  But there is no way to predict the markets."Missing Fed stops printing and raises interest rates because of Inflation."  Should be under 2020 ends.

"Bankruptcy stalls recovery as real economy starts impacting white collar workers, cutting 401K flows 5-10%"Imagine believing you are smarter than the muh-muh-millions of people who make up the market; those investors who have access to the exact same information you do. 

That is why I don’t buy individual stocks, and am happy to collect market returns through no load, low cost, index funds across half a dozen or so different sectors. 

After gambling and losing about $4,000 in the market, it only took me 4-5 years to realize that the collective intelligence of the market is much smarter than my individual self.They’ll surely go down if someone gets elected that thinks a wealth tax makes sense.Anyone who mentions this without talking about how the Fed is manipulating markets isn't telling the whole picture.2000 dot-com bubble burst --> top to bottom = -49.2% in 30 months

2008 housing bubble burst --> top to bottom = -56.8% in 17 months

2020 corona crash --> top to bottom = -35% in 1 month

Gloat all you want, bulls, but you guys basically just lucked into the most limp dick recession in history.Nasdaq100 25% up on the year. This economy just keeps getting stronger. Another recession and who knows, we could be up 50% by year end.When everyone is convinced the market cannot go down and the shit hits the fan. That is when it will drop like a rock. Sadly everyone will blame the fed for not backstopping every investment they make.

This market is about to see a bubble to end all bubbles. If everyone is convinced that the fed can make the market go up or stay up with a few clicks in the keyboard the stock market will bubble beyond any reason.Most gainz in one day for my portfolio in as long as I can remember. Buy & HODL 4 LYFE!!What does “$600/week ends” mean? Im not from the USThis makes zero fucking sense. So investors think companies will make more money in the future NOW, compared to what they thought companies would make before corona happened? How exactly?I've got a lot of Russell in my portfolio.Damn it feels good to be a 3 fund gangster~~2020 ends~~

Marijuana is reclassified from Schedule 1

Long CGCI think we all know the reason: https://twitter.com/DipBuyPanic/status/1285296325127483398?s=19tech leads? Hi it's me the tech lead.Real talk, I snorted at the list.Oh, my sweet summer child... I used to think the same thing when I saw headlines like “ThE CaPe RaTiO Is ThE HiGhEsT SiNcE 2008!” or “S&P 500 PE iS 60% hIGhEr ThAn NoRmAl” I used to think the market was overvalued because of it, and I lost a lot of money sitting on a lot of cash. Pretty much every post on this sub and every article written on the disconnect between the market and the economy ignores the impact of interest rates. Interest rates are at their lowest level since... ever. And the fed is signaling that that’s not going to change anytime soon. That’s going to boost the stocks. Period. End of story. 

To shorten the argument as much as possible: 
1. companies have virtually unlimited access to free money to finance ventures. Insanely low financing costs + money to finance any project you want = big gains.
2. Keep in mind that stocks and bonds are competing for investment dollars. Why buy the bond of a company and get a return capped at 2.3% when you can buy the company’s stock and get paid 4% + capital gains? When money flows out of bonds and into stocks = big gains.

Oh and 2T in stimulus from the government usually helps tooRemindMe! 1 year "this is how it felt"Either the bond market making a new breakout will drag stocks where they belong, or the FED finds a way to transition from capitalism. They couldn't do it the last three recessions, and with all the Q.E they're doing this will be no different.Pandemic is worse than ever and q4 is still coming up.  Just a heads up to you guys.Is the government still pumping money into the market from the first stimulus? Or am I misunderstanding what happened in the first place?We're going much higher this week, and the next week, and the week after, and the month after, and next year, and... you get the picture.

Feel free to join in any time bears. There's much more fun to be had :-)People have more money than they have ever had with nothing to do with it. Until recently most restos were closed. 

Many summer camps are closed, parents not sending kids to overpriced daycares which decreases expenses by thousands of not 10 of thousands of dollars. 

My brother saved 4k not sending kids to camp, and his only real expenses now are food and rent. But still making income.

I believe we're on a bubble, but more of a debt bubble, countries debt won't magically go away.


If a vaccine comes out(no matter how overvalued the underlying stocks are), we will see all travel stocks double, probably the market as well, so technically there is still a lot of room to grow.Gold best performing asset ...the more the fed prints the higher it goes....

Looking ahead pandemic corona virus getting alot worse as Usa getting the brunt of itso as long as the fed is pumping fiat money into the asset market and keep bailing out junk companies the market will not crash! Question is how long the fed can keep doing these? what's the limit? I guess we will see...This is epic. I laughed so hard. Of course, you won't get as many upvotes as you deserve because a large portion of this sub is waiting for the end of the world...

I'd venture to guess that many companies will beat their expectations since the expectations were so damn low. We've been seeing/hearing early previews from tech companies, including SUSE Linux which stated that their "bookings increased 30% year over year" (yep, in spite of coronavirus, they're still able to close million-dollar deals)...  [https://www.suse.com/c/news/suse-reports-strong-second-quarter/](https://www.suse.com/c/news/suse-reports-strong-second-quarter/)Such a clever postThe market will go down when there is no wall of worry to climb.  When everything looks like it should have the all clear is when it will come off.  Sadly that feels a long ways away.Ehh, I might move a little more money into tech but this is not sustainable forever. I don’t know why we’re acting like a bubble can only last 6 months and not years like we’ve seen it do before.Why does reddit root for the market to go down? 

1) DCA every paycheck 
2) keep your eyes down the road; don’t act emotional 
3) over the long term; profitI feel MOMOFOMO. I need to buy.Wouldn't we see a second crash only when the big players in the market decide it's gone up enough and pull their profits?Sell signal? Haha the funny thing about bubbles is everyone in the most current bubble acts as though there has ever been a bubble that didn’t get popped. They all deflate eventually and the patient and not over leveraged folks will get to reap the rewards in the fallout.Everybody knows its been an insane run and investors are in for onr last big squeeze milking the markets knowing the end is near.

Big money already have a plan b when things go south. 

But heyz im a random nobody.This market makes zero logical sense...[removed]So you are telling me there is still a chanceBetting on more hands out from the government that so many of us curse?Everyone knows the market always goes up forever /sLmao NVDA 420 litI mean vaccine euphoria keeps happening. But point noted will continue to go long and buy dips with stop losses until major trendlines start breaking. Until then just enjoy the green. As a day trader 90% of my cash has been made on the long side. And 90% of it has been lossed trying to short. Over the past few months.ShitMoney has no where else to logically go, I don't know why this is so surprising.We\>  Schools reopen and COVID cases surge 

Housing rates drop more you think? Hoping to refinance in Oct/Nov timeframe.Market has no emotions and doesnt care about how people feel of what it should do. Again you are one person against someone else on the other side of the trade. This person has their own emotions and idology, could also be the fed to not have the world economy collapse to ruble, or its buy the dip in the once in life time wealth transfer from the shorters to the longs4000 soonYes yes yes!!![removed]In your face crypto market! 

RemindMe! 1 year "NASDAQ is at 11000 right now"To the moon boysThis post says everything. The power of the gov should be consideredHigh quality post.[removed]Market =/= econcomy.   


So much wealth has been built over the bull market and booming economies in the last 10 years that people are now dumping their cash into what they consider 'safe' stocks. Travel/Leisure stocks will lag for a couple years a least.PMI goes back over 50.
CPI goes way over fees 2% mandate.
Dogs and cat living together mass histeria.At what point do you load the fuck up on spy puts? Debating a long dated option, maybe through June 2021.Oh wow. I like how through this list is and your "You are Here" Like a map in a Mall.OOTL: I haven't paid a lot of attention to the stock market, but recently it's been hard to miss since gains have just been crazy. Looking at the biggest gainers like tesla or amazon, how is it possible for these stocks to go up so much compared to historical price of the stock?

Is it just me or does it just feel like a bitcoin-type hysteria where there was a ton of attention on it and everyone wanted to buy in because of FOMO.Please add proxy dates for future events. Thanks.Fuck I bought like $10K worth of shares in Dell and TTOO today and I instantly regret it like I should’ve waited two more weeks. It’s like I’m a glutton for punishment I never ducking learn stay the course I was out so long missing the sweet gains and now I join right before another drop fuck meI’m so excited!!30,000 by the end of this year.I felt so left behind during this market. I only started investing in December of 2019. I had about 90% of my investment cash in equities and didnt have a lot of liquid cash. When the march dip happened I was luckily brave enough to just hold but fuck I wish I had more cash on me. I luckily have low expenses so I put 90% of my next 3 months paychecks into buying discounted stocks. Profits are profits but man they could have been so much more. Rest of 2020 will be good to us. Praise be to you JPOWELLI think November crashes the market. Biden is favorite to win and he’s expected to tax capital gains.

Can’t see any other candidate favoring the market as trump has.!Remindme 12 months     
OBet against /r/investing and profit.  I see a lot of people seething over missing their shot.Where is June and July unemployment numbers in this list? That said I am long for now, still some fed money coming in, but it’s bound to happen.I'm sure most of you have seen the "Big Short" film. I see today as exactly what happened before the 2008 housing crash. The powers that be are artificially propping up markets so the can sell of thier postiions and not lose everything...eventually, reality will catch up. It may take 2yrs - but it's gonna happen.I am 25  officially 100% debt-free.  Monthly payments are about $700 while going to school making about 2k a month.  I am looking into the next steps on where to put my money and what I can do with it to take advantage of the market?

&#x200B;

Any suggestions would be great 

&#x200B;

Thank you in advance.Upvoted because of your usernameAll it took was $3 Trillion, and here we areThis is exactly why I keep 95% of my portfolio tied to the S&P index and play around with the other 5%.

Things are too fucking crazy to make educated guesses.lol ... All 3 of my stocks were down today. 

What was I thinking when buying these at their peak few weeks ago? I have no fucking idea!!The treasury bond market (eg EDV) started to rally in earnest the first week in Feb. Securities crashed two weeks later, after setting ATHs. Treasuries have started rallying again the past two weeks. Might be a sign.I believe, the market is actually undervalued right now because how much cash the government injected into the economy.  One key thing those doom and gloom people always ignore is the federal government and how much money they injected.This is my new copypasta for r/stocks boomers. Thanks!Is SQQQ ever going to go up again smhyour list is missing....

*As week after 'yendor5' puts a lot of money in the market   <---- you are not here yet.*   :(You could probably run this list back to 2008 at least.At this point the only thing that Mike has the market to go down is if the government stops dumping money into corporations and UPS taxes for the rich. That's the kind of shit that's going to fuck us all over here.Never because the currency collapses and everything costs more. 1 share in apple is more when you print 3 trillion dollars in a few months it costs more dollars for the same amount look at the stock chart for 11 years now and no slow down everLmao. I love this post !RemindMe 1 monthThis is some top notch piss taking right here.RemindMe! 3 monthsI like your list

Redditors have a beautiful way of talking out of their ass yet being so sure of themselves.This is brilliant, educational, and hilarious.  Please extend this to 2021 :DBull market is a self fulfilling prophecy. Every player in the game (investor) wants the market to do one thing (go up), and the market's behavior is determined by the investors.

Even though these valuations are absolutely ridiculous. There is no reason that in the current state of our economy we should be seeing P/E ratios this high. A V-Shaped recovery was a pipe dream from the very beginning!RemindMe 3 monthsNasdaq didn’t reach all time high todaySo should I go all in on qqq now?#woohoo keep pumpinThe housing market collapses?

https://cryptoprice.ng/en/blog/a-housing-collapse-worse-than-the-great-depression-could-be-looming-one-third-of-americans-missed-their-july-housing-paymentsStill don't care how much i miss out. I do not trust the market for now after that day early June DOW dropped 1,800I predict the NASDAQ will take a major hit the rest of the week with earnings this week but who knowsLet’s say you have 50,000 in cash. 

And you leave it in your bank savings account. 

You’re losing 300-400$ a month to inflation. 


Want to buy a house to rent out for income? 
Nah, government hates landlords. You can’t kick out tenants who refuse to pay for years. (For this simulation to work, everyone can’t be rich. For the wealthy royalty class to exist, they need a slave class to do all the work) 

Forced to invest in stocks? Yea ok. 

Ooo damn. Another crash. Another 400billion in wealth transferred form the 99% to the 1%. 

OwFinally a market analysis I fully understandLol, Airlines being that one guy who keeps disconnecting and getting spawn killedDD i can believe inBye bye boomer investing: bUy aNd HoLd cOke 

Hello QQQ calls!Does that mean BDCs are campers?So basically every win I’ve gotten (me being a scrub)I feel personally attackedIt’s just too bad it can’t buy you back inSo they are like the Michael Jordan of the stock world.yea, the guy that comes over an T-bags me every time i try to short something.The tech sector is Goku arriving late and everyone else just has to stay alive until they get there.I wish I could give you gold.So later this week?So all in on DKNG again?Maybe I’m an idiot but this legit blew my mind. Can you link the article/ do you know if they estimated the financial impact?Lot of pro investors, billionaires like Cuban and fund managers aren't to happy with the market as most stayed in cash and now watching as retail investors are making $$. Most are now showing frustration by coming on media and saying things like market is overpriced.

 Some I bet are even shorting the market trying to do bill ackman did when he triggered a crash with his rant on CNBC while he was shorting stocks. But luckily they have failed...This an actual story and if so you got a link? I would love to send that to some peopleis that legit?Why can’t I do both?Legal and illegal sports gambling involves an estimated $200b in wagers.  US equities markets have a value of $40 trillion.  Lack of sports isn't doing much for the markets even if all that money devoted to wagers was in the market right now.If you zoom out it's just one big bull market. I shorted the market, I lost so much. Never againHonestly I don't see why Q2 earnings would have much impact.

Everybody expects them to be terrible, so really the only thing that is going to have a huge impact is actual bankruptcy, which seems very unlikely with bond rates being what they are and Fed policy being what it is.

IMO the real next reality check will be Q3 earnings.  Things have been opening up again, so Q3 earnings will start to confirm whether this really is looking like a "V-shaped" recovery or not.

Yes, I know people already have their opinions.  I'm just saying that if you want to have actual numbers for a hypothetical V-shaped economic change, you need the upslope of the V and not just the downslope.  People are buying stocks based on what they think the future holds, not the present.  It won't be until that future starts to get revealed that their behavior is confirmed or refuted.

If 3Q is bad then I could see a big correction, but we're talking October at that point.

Any likely bad news in 2Q is largely already old news in the minds of investors.Are you willing to fight inflation?NASDAQ maybe.

DOW?

NO“BuT I WaTcHeD ThE BiG ShOrT”If everyone thinks a bubble is coming, then wouldn’t it not happen? How I think of it is if a bubble was so obvious, then it wouldn’t be a bubble lolI wouldn't bet my life on another dip, but I'll wait before investing again. Even if I miss on some gains.Yeah I'd be real bummed out. I had money waiting for Q2 earnings fall to happen, and repeated told myself to 'wait for it, you came up with the plan to throw more money in after Q2 earnings, stick to the plan, don't be seduced by the market going up now.'Imagine buying everything in FebruaryHey that's me! Major FOMO going on now... I keep telling myself it was the right choice. 

We needed the liquidity because we've been house hunting and using that cash as a down payment, needed to have it ready to go in what still is a hot market. Here we are, 5 months later, still haven't bought a house...

I try not to peek too much at the market... I sold AAPL, AMZN, NFLX, and FB and don't want to think about how many thousands I missed out on.Imagine shorting the market during the end of March. *shudders*Hey dude like when do i buy back in the market man?I rebalanced my portfolio in feb. Brought equity down to 20% from 60%. I did this before COVID. I though market was expensive. After COVID, I thought that market will go down further what I have thought earlier so I didn’t buy. I still think market was expensive at pre Covid levels. I still think correction would come. I am waiting patiently for things to be clear.:([deleted]I sold my long positions in AMZN and NFLX in April. Both were at all time highs at the time, and I made a nice profit. Still hurts knowing I left so much money on the table.I was considering selling my AAPL at $300, glad I didn't.I sold most things in March because my 50,000 employee company had a 90%reduction in revenue and was talking about laying off up to 80% of their employees. I cashed out thinking I was going to need to use the money when I lost my job and couldn't get another one because everyone is unemployed.

My company took money through the cares act so they can't layoff until October 1st, but they have already warned us to expect over 20,000 layoffs at my company alone October 1st.

With an economic outlook that grim I need the cash, and I also certainly don't understand how the economy is at historic highs.don't you dare donate 10% of your net worth to a charity this monthThis sub is now telling me to do the exact opposite of what it tells me to do.  Uh oh.How does that work when this sub isnt monolithic?Eskimo brothers!I got downvoted to hell yesterday telling people that the market was going to continue to rally.

Today felt like a little bit of vindication.Lately WSB has been on a winning streak. CALLS ON TESLA AMZN ATH, ANY STRIKE. 


There is no IQ or technical analysis needed anymore to make money. You just buy 1 call of either Tesla or Amazon and it is free money. In fact, I would say anyone not making profit during this bull market should be ashamed of themselvesGood luck in the futureThis is always the way to go when it comes to Reddit.took so much self control not to panic sell in the last 3 months... just kept telling myself timing the market is impossible, im young, set it and forget it.Congrats on your $12,000 gainBack to square one 👍To be honest, if you had some of the sideways moving stocks (they exist), it was easy to think we aren't actually in a bull market.It’s got everything it needs to reinforce the bitter investors in here who want the market to be down for *mysterious unknown reasons*. Lol.this is a good play. limit your downside with options, but don't limit your upside. If its not worth the cost you made money, and if the bottom falls out you aren't the one holding the bag.

Another way to hedge is to have a really long time horizon - but if you are getting old and rich you can leave some money on the table so you can leave the table with money.options still aren't cheap rn, *especially* on tech which has been leading the rally. buying ATM puts would basically wipe out a substantial portion of the gains you'd have made on those tech stocks.Is there a public schedule one can see, or how do you know when this balance sheet expansion occurs?I see lots of people drawing lines on charts. the only chart that matters is the Fed balance sheet. if it goes up, BUY! if it goes down, BUY THE DIP! 100% guarantee they will step in to bail us outMarket was rallying for multiple weeks before the balance sheet expanded again. The biggest part of the rally was weeks ago, while the balance sheet was contracting. You have an idiotic sense of cause and effect.I don’t think it’s the fed pumping stocks, the interest rate has gone so low that institutions (like pension funds) see no true value in holding treasuries since the RoR does not even outpace inflation, so moving into equities are the way they can actually get a true return. Do people really think the fed is buying tech stocks and whatnot to pump the market?There's no way stocks go down until the election. Time to buy then sell in October.The fed fully intends to flex the USD and print the recession away. I don't know how this will work when there is no spending but let's find outWhoa careful now. You will feel the wrath of the cook mod if you say anything about the FED pumping money into the markets. From what I last heard, it will set us up for a “soft landing”. Whatever the fuck that means.

|-|-|-|-|Until when?I’m buying a house if that happens. I’m very interested in how the next 1-2 years play out.Spy to 340 am I right, by the dip on those reitsMarkets crash on unexpected news and uncertainty. Everyone knows shits fucked already.Does it matter if the market dips though? Unless you’re planning on retiring this year, then a red day is another opportunity to add more shares. There will be red days in the future; tech was largely red last week but had a massive rally today, almost erasing all of last weeks losses. 

If your plan is that you want to have more money in the future, you should keep investing as it’s one of the most accessible options available for folks to both build wealth and try to create some kind of retirement in the future. 

Nothing is ever guaranteed, and I think sometimes folks just like the idea of holding lots of their capital in a bank account because folks don’t deal with ambiguity well. Cash is a position, but it should be carefully considered and never considered as a primary long term option, as you’ll inevitably hinder yourself every year that the market increases and you miss those gains.You’re absolutely right. Based off everything OP crossed out in his post, we should def be expecting a dip. The tricky part is when will the dip happen. I remember when SPY was trading near $270 and people were talking about its way too high, and that $275 would be the peak of the dead cat bounce. Then $280 became the peak, then $290.. and if at any point you decided to sell/short you would’ve lost a lot. So it’s not so much as predicting a downturn rather than it is timing the downturn.Makes sense. I guess the market will go up another 50%The only reason we recovered from that dip is because most people are making more unemployed than they were employed before the pandemic, that ends this week, let's see what consumer confidence is come next monthWe didn't know the Feds will print so much money. Now we know.There will be a dip when the fed decides to stop printing unlimited money and the government decides to stop stimulusIf there was going to be another dip it would have happened by now with daily cases in the states well past 60k for some time now.

I think the US government accepts that life goes on and maybe 0.1 percent of the population dies from it in 12 months time or whatever.Businesses that are shutting down or too poor to be on the stock market or everybody knew it was going to be bad anyways. It's already been priced in.

You should not be feeling any effects from some restaurant down the street shutting down. If you are then you aren't putting your money in the right places.They'll only stop printing when the rest of the world stops using their dollarsThe white collar part is going to happen in October. A lot of companies are going to laid off a lot of people. The airline industry is already doing this and some tech companies.Same here except I lost $20,000 gambling on options.>After gambling and losing about $4,000 in the market, it only took me 4-5 years to realize that the collective intelligence of the market is much smarter than my individual self.

Hey, you're doing it wrong, you're supposed to say that the market is irrational and keep believing you're right!That depends on how much risk you're willing to take.  Just because the herd is YOLOing their savings, leveraging themselves to the hilt and getting away with it for now it doesn't mean it's not risky.  I'm bearish, still invested in gold and some in stocks but not as much as before the pandemic.  

Sure, I'm not making much money at the moment, but I feel comfortable with the level of risk I'm taking.  I'm well aware I could be wrong and overcautious, I've never said otherwise.We didn't have 0-comission trading 12 years ago, let alone 20 years ago. This is how the average holding period has changed [over time](https://imgur.com/a/PDu0Z0S).Luckily we have had reddit saying the market would tank every day since March so we haven't had that problem.Bubble to end all bubbles. Confirmed I'm buying more calls.Get me my bubble fluid and my bubble wand. We’re about to pop this bitch like no one’s ever seen.The fact that reddit has been screaming about this being a bubble because no one here understands monetary policy/the federal reserve...is exactly why this isn't a bubble. The fed is not backstopping anything except in reddit's doom porn circlejerks.Fed has infinite money. They can backstop forever if there's the political will for it. Trump will prop the market up until Election Day, guaranteed.I think it is opposite. There is no bubble. Market is undervalued because of trillions of cash, the government injected into the economy. There is a lot money floating around. The only way it is a bubble if the government takes back trillion of dollars they printed, which is not realistic.More than on 3/13 or 3/24 when the S&P 500 gained over 9% in a day?There's a federal program due to covid that adds an additional $600 to people's unemployment weekly checks.  That ends July 31st unless they renew it somehow.The long term risk free rate has dropped precipitouslyActually, investors do not get any of the profits unless there's a dividend.  It's speculation and wallstreet darling syndrome.  People buy because they think in the future the stock price will be higher when they sell.Crowe?1000 or 3000 I hope. You wouldn't be very happy if its 2000Russell athletic?Grub?A real 3 fund investor allocates his cards rightPowell should be in jail> I believe we're on a bubble, but more of a debt bubble, countries debt won't magically go away.

 Not magic but inflation will make it go away.It's weird, right? Since civilization began and certainly since the industrial age there's always been many more good times than not - and yet collapse/end of the world porn reigns supreme so often. 

I mean entropy exists. I firmly believe in the collapse of my death, America's death, humanity, etc. but people have a real difficulty with time scales. There's a whole lot of slow decline that happens before the death of most organisms. But if you're in a time-bound activity (ie. investing) why not bet on what's largely been the norm?   


The stock market still only represents a fraction of the 'real economy' - which is what is getting absolutely hammered. As you point out tech companies and many large companies are going to have incredible positions after this as small companies falter. It's hard to see us go full 1929 when companies like MSFT are sure to have monster earnings. It's just not the same.Because the fed is diluting your buying power to buy bonds from companies that acted irresponsibly knowing they would get bailed out if they pissed it away chasing buybacks.

This is bigger than shrugging your shoulders and taking your meager gains. The bill will come due. And your children will pay it, there are no free lunches. There's a reason FAANG makes new ATH's every day while small caps get obliterated.

Wealth redistribution on a massive scale.Because its completely detatched from all real world metrics of prosperity an wealth and everytime the nasdaq has a +3% day some tech billionaire makes quite literally millions of times more money than the entire networth of your pathetic little 401k.

Sorry if thats too real for the wageslaves here but thats the truth.Three easy steps.What is this acronym? I only understand YOLOSecond crash will happen once there are no buyers. As long as there is as high of a bearish sentiment as there is now, the market has room to run. Slowly, week after week, bears give in and finally buy into the market, sending the market higher. 

Once there aren’t much bears around, the slow down in buying will begin to reverse the market. 

There are plenty of retail traders that are still bearish, and plenty of hedge funds that are still on the sidelines. I don’t think this train is ending anytime soon.Your submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

1. TLT starts going up

2. VXX stops falling and starts going up

3. QQQ is at ATH

4. IWM is drooping downwards

Well, today all 4 conditions have just been satisfied. I'm expecting a correction to happen by the end of the week.I for one am stoked to see the 5 yr treasury hit 0%> I believe, the market is actually undervalued right now because how much cash the government injected into the economy. One key thing those doom and gloom people always ignore is the federal government and how much money they injected.

 So the solution is to just keep printing more money and all will be well?Holding cash is a sin now. Never hold cash or bonds!!

If you’re bearish put it in gold

Bullish put it in stocksDid you estimate how much of an impact i am curious ? I don’t know why anyone downvoted your post. It’s clear that the entire reason for certain elements of the cash injection was to influence the “perception “ of the economy entirely.Clearly it wasn't a pipe dream because it already happened 😂> Every player in the game (investor) wants the market to do one thing (go up),

Not short sellers.RemindMe! 3 monthOh yes it did. It didn't pass that intraday high last Monday, but it had a record high close.This is misleading; many banks instituted what are essentially "no questions asked" loan deferral programs, even on mortgages. This means that while the numbers for renters may be more accurate, the numbers for homeowner missed payments is most likely overstated as many customers have opted for the deferrals.If you still think the market gives a shit about something as trivial as that you haven't been paying attention :-)NASDAQ companies stand to benefit the most in the post-COVID world. It will continue to outperform the S&P and obliterate DOW.Side ways. Good enough news to keep it from tanking, not good enough to justify buying up more.[removed]Ah yea tech carrying the market!LMAOSo calls on ATVI?And keeps screaming at his mom to let him play.

Seen it far too oftenCake[Zoomer vs boomer investing side-by-side comparison](https://i.imgur.com/H5BvQfo.png)I never really understood this obsession with companies like Coke and McDonalds.  To me, as a relatively young person in my 30s, it is obvious that junk fast food and sugary sweet sodas are on a downtrend and have been for years.  Young people in particular just don't drink that stuff. 
All my friends in their 20s and 30s drink lots of coffee, tea, seltzer waters, kombucha, etc, I never see anyone with a sugary soda.  But, maybe that's just my unique experience. 

Yes, they are still popular, but they are not going to grow and there certainly will not be any big demand boost.

Is the idea that Coke owns other brands that are increasing in popularity? Still seems unwise to me, when their flagship product is so dated.As a millennial who just bought coke to hold it until precovid prices this makes me feel bad :(For Boomers, doing something like buying and holding blue chip dividend stocks makes a ton of sense.

Thanks!  Now shorting the market, wish me luck!HOFV is cheaperI think he's joking.The Wall Street Journal and CNBC have been harping on this for a couple of months.  Yesterday the WSJ had an article titled "Don’t Worry About the Tesla Bubble. The Market Has Other Issues" ( [https://www.wsj.com/articles/dont-worry-about-the-tesla-bubble-the-market-has-other-issues-11595160000?mod=markets\_major\_pos11](https://www.wsj.com/articles/dont-worry-about-the-tesla-bubble-the-market-has-other-issues-11595160000?mod=markets_major_pos11) ).  Here is a quote:

Look only at [Tesla ](https://quotes.wsj.com/TSLA)[TSLA **9.47%** ](https://quotes.wsj.com/TSLA?mod=chiclets)and it is clear that the stock market in the midst of a wild speculative frenzy. As [Deutsche Bank](https://quotes.wsj.com/DB) strategists put it, the electric-car maker has added the equivalent of eight [Ford Motors](https://quotes.wsj.com/F) [F **-2.06%** ](https://quotes.wsj.com/F?mod=chiclets)or 27 Renaults in market value since March as it benefited from [the surge in retail investing](https://www.wsj.com/articles/individuals-roll-the-dice-on-stocks-as-veterans-fret-11591732784)—or, depending how you think of it, the shift of gamblers from sports betting into stocks.It's mentioned briefly in today's paper here. 

Don’t Worry About the Tesla Bubble. The Market Has Other Issues. https://www.wsj.com/articles/dont-worry-about-the-tesla-bubble-the-market-has-other-issues-11595160000


It essentially goes: TSLA is up a fuck ton this year due to "a surge in retail investing--or, depending on how you think of it, the shift of gamblers from sports betting into stocks"These pros are going to fomo in, it was a disgrace that funds’ equity positioning in March was at all time lowNot making $$, just inflated "last traded price", if everyone tries to sell then everyone is left with the same cash they started out with.

Its not $$, until you close the trade and sell it.They'll still come out on top.It's a myth that smart money always wins and retail loses. If you  speculate you'll get killed no matter who you are. If you do quant trading you can succeed but you're likely the 0.001% retail that engages in quant. If you are a long term investor that buys stock of high quality companies at low prices like in the covid crash then you'll make money (but you have to take profits). This is a once in a decade opportunity and it is one more occasion where smart money was too smart for its own good. Like they say it's better to make money than to be right.

And fck Mark Cuban who acts like he is a god, I'm glad he has severe FOMO-itis. Buffet too missed out from what I've heard.

Dot.com was at new highs in Dow,  S&P,  and Nasdaq. Broadbased.  Today, S&P hasn't even hit new highs yet.

The total volume of the stock market is about 200B> If you zoom out it's just one big bull market. 

This is pretty much always true.“Wait, it’s all a bull market?”

*pulls out gun*

“Always was.”Same here. Short after fib 50% retracement. Cut loss at -90%>I shorted the market, I lost so much. Never again

If only I could learn from my shorts like that lol... 

I'll be right eventually, right? Right?same boat, I can't believe what we're seeing.

It's like the market thinks COVID 19 gives people the ability to shit gold or something.Fed til it doesnt.Japan isnt

Past performance isn't indicative of future returnsThis was the best bear market ever though. Please do another one bears. You guys did awesome . Tqqq at 35. Gimme that again please. I love bear markets.I think you absolutely hit this on the head. I see no reason for the aggregate stock market to go down until we start seeing real bankruptcies. Until there, there's so much liquidity and government money in the market, that its stoking confidence. When the US government itself backs the entire stock market, we have no reason to worry about devaluation of the market.

Until companies can no longer pay people, including shareholders and creditors, and become insolvent and actually file for bankruptcy, I see no reason why investors would be scared of putting their money in the market.Could become the “October Surprise” of the election.You're probably right. I think the market is where it is because there is a belief that the Fed will make sure we don't crash - or at least crash for long. That, and the age-old where else do we put our money with yields near 0%.3Q 2020 is old news. 2021 is old news. Investors are focused on what happens in 2022.>People are buying stocks based on what they think the future holds, not the present.

This. 

Though also because they think the Fed will and can forever prop up the market.the future is not q3 bud, its the next several decades, centuries, millenia.To the death! I’m armed to the teeth!I'll believe in inflation when we see it. People have been banging the inflation drum since 2008 and we failed to reach target inflation even with rates remaining at 1-2% for a decade.The dotcom bubble was extremely obvious and everyone called it a bubble, even before it popped.There’s a combination right now of “FOMO nothing else to do with my money” and people who think there’s a huge bubble. The former group is winning right now as they simply find no need to sell even though shit is bad.Bubbles are obvious all the time.  Timing of when it pops isn't obvious.

California real estate is a perpetual bubble.  As soon as a bubble deflates another begins and it is almost independent of how many units are built because people are trained that their wealth will come from their houses so no buy is a bad buy.  Until it isn't.  Rinse, repeat.

So bubbles exist all over.  They are often easy to spot.  You just don't know if they will pop today or a few years down the road.That's exactly it, if anything right now is more likely to be a bubble than March :-)Why though? When stop orders are a thing why would you have to wait? You can protect your gains against a big dip with stop or trailing stop orders and just continue to ride the wave while it lasts. Worst case scenario your automatic order catches your fall and you don't fall much or at all if that dip happens in a few months and your stop order secures your profit.You’re gna fomo inIt beats selling everything in march...

\*edit: From the standpoint of someone who's portfolio is 90% QQQ.I bought a lot in February; about 20% of my portfolio. I bought a lot more in late March. :)



Thankfully, I'm up 11% overall. That extra $ will go towards rent while I'm on unemployment; now that PPP is over, I'm out of a job.I tried behind pro active and fill my IRA on New Years every year. If I only waitedBought in early Feb when market was at 29k. Lost my shirt so I bought again in late March when market was at 21k.I have a buddy who did. Invested for the first time.

I told him numerous times to just DCA during the crash.  I hope he followed my advice.You'd only be down 5% or soMy wife cashed out a 10-year pension and we rolled it over into her traditional IRA in VFIAX, VSMAX, VIMAX, and VTWAX during the December ascent, so the February and March bloodbath was difficult to watch.  The good news is her pension payout was partially based on the market during its high. 

Regardless, while 3 of her funds are still in the red 2-5%, we put about 30% into VFIAX, and it is in the green at a 14% return due to dollar cost averaging from an initial July 2018 position.  Therefore, this one fund has carried her portfolio to an overall 2% return, so with a little over a decade to retire, we’re comfortable with this measly short-term gain...LOL!I transferred 100k to a rollover IRA from a managed 401k in February and bought mostly stocks. It dipped about 30k in March, but now it's already +10k.YoU DoNt LoSe UnTiL U SeLL[deleted]Think about how much you probably made on those.

The world is still a little crazy. You may have another opportunity.Don't feel bad about this at all - This is absolutely the right approach. If you need the cash for day-to-day or family expenses, it really shouldn't be in the market. It makes sense to invest $ in the market only if you don't need it for a 5+ year time horizon. Evaluating the decision based on just one instance of the outcome (i.e the market went up for 2-3 months) is a bias called "resulting" - it is a cousin of FOMO. You definitely did the right thing. Nobody could predict where the market would have gone and you wouldn't have the house you wanted had it gone the other way :).Same with us. Been searching the greater Seattle area over a year. Can't find anything remotely decent under 450k. Crazy frustratingokay well this isn't really a bad decision to be honest, selling in march because you panic and think you can time the market is bad, but selling and holding cash because you are house hunting is not bad. investing allocations are based on time horizon, and if your time horizon is very short, cash is fine.Ouch. Never mind thousands. You're talking tens of thousands.

Sorry to hear that dude.

I'm still trudging along with my indexes, completely oblivious to the market from week to week.Most of these have gone up around 40% in the past 3 months. So, if you had 50k invested, it would be around 20kuhhh try buying always and never sellingIf you thought the market was expensive pre-covid it's still expensive now.Time in the market beats timing the market.  I wouldn't wait too long.Never sell and you'll be fine. If the markets go to 0, people aren't eating and your rental doesnt mean jack shit. You jumped off a roller coaster in motion man. Just strap in and hold on.You got him. He's gunna donate 20% to a for profit company next month.I donate. For real. I have a few Patrons I donate too like Sci-Show on youtube. PBS. The big one is FreeCodeCamp.[removed]He better not give me any of his gains eitheryou joke but it does seem like everything truly corrupt happens through a charityDo the opposite of all of it

It's basically a 500-IQ DCA...the top comments are a good proxy.The top 20 or so posts typically are tilted one way.By investing in peat. 

No one on this sub recommends that.You stop holding all your money in cash by buying a small amount of stock in accordance with a long term strategy, then let the FOMO take hold a dump the rest of your money in, since long term stocks grow faster than cash.  
Then you liquidate a portion to ensure you have a buffer, before panic selling the rest and pulling out entirely, since the market is too volatile and cash is king.  

You can contradict everyone, as long as you choose the right order. :)>	I got downvoted to hell yesterday telling people that the market was going to continue to rally.

Says a commenter with the previous comment from 5 days ago. If you deleted your comment then I can only assume that you “got downvoted to hell” because it was mean-spirited. Rarely have I seen a reasonable comment being downvoted even if the topic was controversial.I like your username.[removed]Fat green Mondays always follow after a reddish previous week.Some people were buying Tesla calls with a strike of 3500 that expire on Friday.[removed]I honestly haven’t looked at either of my 401ks this whole time.  Maybe that isn’t even a big deal, I don’t know🤷🏼‍♂️. Had around 100k before shit hit the fan. Hopefully it’s getting back towards that.I feared too much because I had no idea what's happening (still don't). Still don't have any investments yet.>	just kept telling myself timing the market is impossible

Of course timing the market is possible, it’s just extremely difficult. So difficult that most people are better off not timing.you should be proud of yourself, and also you learned a valuable lesson when you're young - there was panic, you held on anyways and kept your money in the market, and you're benefitting from it now. hopefully it will help you be calm next time too.You and me both! Glad we made the right decisionLol!While options are getting cheaper due to volatility decreasing, they aren’t necessarily cheap. Right now it would cost around 10% of your portfolio’s value to buy ATM puts for a year out (based on SPY). Last year this was more like 4-5%. Granted that you may have reasonable beliefs that a doubling+ of premiums is fully pricing in the current economic state.atm puts are not insurance. otm puts are cheaper than a month or two ago [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WALCL](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WALCL) 

They update it every week on thursday/friday, so you can see what happened in the previous week. Unfortunately you don't know in advance what the next week will be, but we do know the fed is doing Infinite QE at least until end of year so chances are its going up more from here.So buy if it goes up or down? (not being sarcastic, trying to understand more clearly)If its going up buy with leverage is the better strategy, its irresponsible not to.Until  they dont.>I welcome all the comments to tell me why the fed does not pump stocks, and why the balance sheet expansion the last 10 years has nothing to do with the bull market / bubble of the last 10 years. I will sit back and collect my risk free money, while you tell me I am wrong.

Got the first r/investing comment telling me I'm wrong! As I type this comment, the S&P is up another 0.7%.

The only thing easier to predict than this fed-manipulated market is the r/investing economics experts telling you that the fed has nothing to do with stocks lol.

Keep the comments coming people, every "you are an idiot" comment is another 1% gain in my bank account.>Do people really think the fed is buying tech stocks and whatnot to pump the market?

No, they are just causing massive amounts of inflation in equity markets with all their printing. You don't need to buy stocks to pump markets, you just need to kill yields everywhere else and pump trillions of dollars into the system. The printed money will make its way into equities because there really is nowhere else to go.What you're saying is that pensions will be fucked in longer term?When buffett and Dalio both think bonds are worthless u know they’re worthless[removed]Where is this bot!

That was my mistake last time.Okay, but what causes markets to rise then?I think people underrate the value of cash as a small portion of their portfolio, regularly rebalanced with the main allocation. For individual investors, you can still get alright interest rates from banks like Ally. These interest rates are higher than 10yr treasury yields... 

Cash will outperform bonds in a rising yields scenario, and it's also a rock of your portfolio that will give you peace and allow you to get rebalance alpha.

70% stocks 20% long term treasury bonds 10% cashIf you expect it, it won't happen.The dip will happen but it will be a different reason, not any of the reasons listed in this thread.This.

Unlimited money is recipe for disaster.[removed]From what I can tell, it's already happening(ed).  I've personally heard of the following impacts: Nurses/Doctors prevented from doing elective surgeries, Lawyers and Clerks have had courts shutdown, and startups have laid off thousands of ten workers.  I honestly expect this part to be a slow grind.  Why do you think October?I'm just happy I'm not smart enough to understand options. Keeps my nose out of trouble.Yup, and when you’re in a losing position, always double down, and keep believing and saying you’re right all the way to the poorhouse!Theyre literally pledging "unlimited capital" to backstop a fund called "Vaungaurds High Yield Fallen Angel Fund" for corporations that were credit worthy that now arent.

Either you're delusional, willfully ignorant, desperately long with margin, or all of the above.The feds most effective instrument is making people believe they’re doing somethingThe quotes grew 25 times higher than the returns on market indices — that's what makes a bubbleThat’s not a market that’s welfareThey can only do one thing with that infinite money.Can they be trusted though?Bubbles have to do with pricing versus actual underlying value. Insane amounts of liquidity does not increase actual underlying value, it increases pricing. Literal definition of a bubble. When an alternate investment, even if that is a low-inflation cash position, becomes more attractive, the rug will pull.No I don't think so, I think on those days I made like $20k or something like that. But that was only to get back to where I was. This is a new ATH.

Though I will say, that time period was absolutely crushing but taught me such an important lesson: never sell. There were multiple times that I thought about selling, but every time it went down by that much I just bought more.9% of a much smaller number, though.Thanks!When I convert that to Canadian dollars, that's just insane to me that people are getting the equivalent of $4000 CAD/month. That is more than enough to have a really good life in all non-major Canadian cities.that has happened many times in last decade and it did nothing to help profits arise from the near decade long flatline> People buy because they think in the future the stick price will be higher when they sell.

But why would they think prices will continue to rise then?Westbrook.IWM's nice for those brief bull market spurts after a sharp correction, but long-term I don't see it going anywhere relative to the rest of the market.Yep the inflation tax.Nailed it. There is no free lunch.I think that central monetary policy, a new political regime, economic reform/regulation, green infrastructure investment, etc. will all lead to sustainable growth is in our future. 

Ppl wring their hands about the Feds actions and “dilution” but the current projection for 2020 inflation is %0.62.Do you think this will change? Your comment resonates with me, but I also think that it will never change, regardless of political or societal pressures. 

Here’s why I say that: the reality is that these billionaires are getting wealthy because of compound interest. The concept of compounding has been around since the Roman times, and it was largely hated because it works against you (eg any kind of loan payment). 

Compound interest exists in all sorts of markets; savings accounts, equities, housing, bonds, precious metals, etc.

When one asset class does poorly, others rise to take its place. This is usually temporary as one or more of the above asset classes have almost always been in favor. In the rare instances where this isn’t true, then cash is the optimal spot, but it is typically replaced by one of the above in a very short order.

As long as we have compounding, the rich will continue to get richer. You mentioned that you’re a white collar worker, and have a 401k. It’s highly probable that you will eventually have hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars in your 401k if you’re maximizing it every year. Eventually, due to compounding your monthly/annual gains in the market will surpass your salary. I know plenty of people in this boat with their investments. They still go to work every day, but they have plenty of capital either in retirement accounts or in personal taxable accounts. It’s hard to feel like a “wage slave” when you’re the benefactor of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars per month (in the case that you have a 6-7 figure account). With a very limited amount of effort, you can sell into strength and redeploy your capital into another compounding machine (eg going from equities to housing). 

Where does this lead us? I don’t know. I don’t think anyone has the answers. I don’t believe that compounding will ever disappear in our lifetimes, as it has persisted hundreds of years. I think the best and most powerful thing a person can do is to get to the place where they aren’t under the pressure of going to work for a paycheck; when you’re able to go to work because you feel like it, it gives you an entirely different perspective, as you’re working on your own terms. 

Thanks for your comment.I’m fully cognizant of my place in the world as far as income vs. the top percentage; but even if we lived in a heavily regulated more leftist society; w/o a doubt putting money into the stock market is an avenue for ppl to grow wealth. 

What I’m trying to say is, “yes the system is messed up as currently is, but also, “don’t hate the stock market when it has had and will continue to have a positive effect for quite literally millions of ppl.” 

I know I’m anecdotal but I feel as if I’m a good example of such success. I’ve been putting money away little by little with my sub-six digit annual salary and I’ve seen fantastic returns in the 3.5 years I’ve been investing.Right!? I feel like I’m the asshole for offering a reasonable way to prosper. *shrug* 

Financial literacy, a minimum wage increase, more widespread access to markets, increased education spending, college loan forgiveness (with stricter limits on college loans + free community college), infrastructure spending, are all the ways forward!

Aim small, miss small. First move was correct (short at 50%), but holding to 90% was way too much heat.ah yes. Betting against the fed.... lovely strategy. Send the P & L’s after.I honestly don't believe we will ever see another bear market.

Look at the feds balance sheet the last week, they began expanding again, surprise surprise we broke through 3230 not even a week later lmao.

The fed is locked into 0 rates, so the only path from here is QE basically forever. The next 10 years are going to make the last 10 look like a bear market in comparison, mark my words. I plan on retiring in 10 years as a multimillionaire if the fed does what I expect them to do, TQQQ/SPXL during balance sheet expansion sessions is literally free money, like a shitton of free money.Oh, I don't think it will take bankruptcy before it goes down.  I said that only bankruptcy would get it to go down before the 3Q earnings come in.  Everybody already knows the 2Q results are going to be really bad.

I think where investors will be looking is the 3Q results.  Things are going back to normal right now in most of the world.  So the question is how much of the disruption only lasted during the lockdown, and how much will persist.

If things go right back to business as usual, then there really is no reason the stock prices shouldn't go back to business as usual.  There was a cash flow hit in 1-2Q, but that's really it.  

On the other hand, if everything is open but companies are barely treading water, that may worry investors a lot more.  That suggests consumer spending patterns/etc are being disrupted for the longer term.  A one-quarter event shouldn't impact stock prices all that much.  A multi-year downturn probably will impact stocks a fair bit.  When you're talking about one quarter with all the doors closed the government can mail everybody a stimulus check and the Fed can increase the money supply.  When you're talking about years of downturn the Fed can't go making bond rates -3% without  causing a lot of secondary problems.I mean, with the whole Enterprise thing, is it likely they won't put in money anyway?
Or were the people purchasing its stock likely not prototypical "investors?" 
(I'm just learning about this whole investing world, so I'm genuinely curious.)It isn't JUST that the Fed will intervene, but the belief that any intervention could succeed.

If this is a quarter-long V-shaped crisis that is plausible.  The Fed can generate an incredible amount of liquidity.  If the economy is solid in Feb and solid in August and you just need to spread out the impact to fix the cash flow issues, that is a classic banking problem, and it is exactly the sort of problem the Fed has the ability to impact.

Banks don't create wealth - they move it around from one point in time to another.  They let today's wealth be used to solve tomorrow's problems, and they let tomorrow's wealth be used to solve today's problems.  The Fed is just a REALLY big bank.

Now, if you have a protracted slump, and we don't see Feb levels of activity for another year or two, then that is a LOT of shortfall.  It starts to become harder to believe that the Fed can spackle over that with a few trillion in QE without causing a lot of other problems.  

So, right now everybody believes the Fed WILL act.  What 3Q and 4Q data will show is whether the Fed CAN act.  Just how sharp is the right side of the V?  

IMO things aren't looking very good right now.  Where I live things are legally allowed to open, but a lot of stores in malls/etc are still closed and traffic is pretty limited.  Now, maybe those same stores are selling like crazy online.  Maybe the sales have just shifted to Amazon, and we'll see winners and losers but no overall shift in the economy.  Or maybe we'll see some winners but overall a broad decline in the economy.  As we get more and more 3Q data investors will start to react (IMO).

The question of 0% yields is still a pressing one, but if people think the market will drop they will probably still choose 0% over -30% short-term.

I think it will be interesting to see how actively-managed funds do this year.  If ever there was a year that should justify an actively managed fund this is it.  A passive fund is going to hold just as much stock in some clothing retailer as they did six months ago.  An active fund could be buying UPS and Amazon and shorting all those stores selling trendy clothes to teenagers in the mall.  How will kids even know what brand is cool when school is shut down?I’ve already invested in terraforming Mars.Sure, but NPV highly weights the next few quarters.

But I was wrong, the markets didn't crash, so I thought the markets didn't care about corona. I invested again.

Any advice on how I can reduce risk?> Why though? When stop orders are a thing why would you have to wait? 

Because they're not guaranteed to work, particularly in a massive sell off.  For the Stop-loss order to work there still needs to be a buyer.  With the rise of HFT and other changes, there are far fewer true market makers, making it far more likely you'll either hit the stop limit and not sell, or sell for far less than you wanted to.Mind giving more insights into the best ETF/index to invest in?

Also, the US economy is so vitally essential to the world, whatever happens here has a drastic effect on everyone else.

Because if you pick 1970-2020 you’ve made 923% (dividend reinvested, in yen). If you pick 1980-2020, you’ve made 250% (dividend reinvested, in yen). If you want to know what you’d make in USD investing in the 80s, you’d get a 678% return (dividend reinvested). So this talk I keep hearing about “look at Japan” doesn’t really make much sense. The only thing it says is that even in a deflation economy, or a stagnant economy, or a crash, over time, stock investment is the best way to make money.Money is not a zero sum game at all, we print money every single day. 

Markets go up because of growth, growth happens because people are born every day and because technology creates efficiencies every day.thank you for the correction. Just consider my version a crappy off-brand, I guess.So inflation in the housing market = higher home prices.  Score!Okay, then less talking more shortingFunny I've seen this same comment every week for 5 months now.Better hold those assets then methinks.What could possibly wrong?I fully agree with your hypothesis. Only thing is, the official inflation stats are absolute rubbish. You won't be retiring when you suddenly find that your expenses and housing cost have trippled in 10 years while the official rate is the same old 2%. 

What we are seeing isn't market growth. It is inflation, currently disproportionately effecting assets.Same hereI'm with you on the V-shape recovery. The Fed has said just as much that it isn't happening. Even though places are re-opening, they are not at capacity and places are even closing down again in some areas of the country. Small businesses are going to go under unless the government continues to give out loans. It's going to be years before we reach 2019 levels of economic activity, assuming a usable vaccine is created and widely available by spring 2021, and that's still an unknown. 


I am not sure where we go from here. I am positioned pretty heavily in companies that are thriving in this environment to offset my index funds. I did not sell during the March sell-off, but I would not be shocked to see us drop at some point. I'm amazed we are where we are, but I have learned that I am not an expert and should not try to predict the day to day market movements.You mean that one time the market crashed because of criminal activities which resulted in new regulations to avoid it happening again? If that's enough to scare you how are you invested in anything but T bills?

Anyways that "worst in history" event resulted in about a 9% drop. Most people recommend a trailing stop around 8-10%. So unless this isolated even repeats itself to the exact same scale, it's not something someone with a trailing stop should worry about.

Man people just love showing they know stuff sometimes...Duh I bet the guy was like 8 years oldYou need trade clearance from work before you can place sell orders? Then unfortunately no I do not have any suggestions to reduce the risk other then being in cash if you think the market will crash.Before you can sell anything?  Or just shares of your company's stock?  

If the former, can you request trade clearance from your work to place a stop order (as /u/crownpr1nce suggested)?That might be true if your stop order is too narrow. But a "Falsh Crash" is extremely rare and the most known one was due to market manipulation that led to criminal charges. Generally speaking the market does not sell off that quickly. Even the worst days of 2020 a stop loss would have been perfectly doable at 8-10% (last month's gains on the Nasdaq 100)I like VGTVOOVTI. All the US stocksPersonally, I don't have any insights.

The "I'm [some absurdly high percentage] cash" crowd who have been vocal here since March are goofs.  The second shit went wonky, they abandoned the strategies that we empirically know to be most successful in the long run.  Those are the moments you need to trust your long term strategies.except it's not hindsight at this point. tons and tons of research has shown that the vast majority of investors will perform best if they just

1) buy index funds

2) fucking hold them

3) rebalance over time, at set intervals, as retirement approaches

4) don't sell until they retire and need the cash

this formula is not that complicated. it's not "hindsight". i'm tired of people saying its "hindsight" to not have sold in march. it was a bad decision at the time, the numbers were *known*, the probability that you time the market correctly was *known* to be super fucking low. and plenty of people tried to say this on this sub, they said, hey just fucking chill out and HOLD, you can't time the market.

I did not address his comment because I have no idea what the heck he is talking about. What rally?

The markets were going sideways, I don't consider a sideways market as rallying...The fed buys up treasuries and MBS (and I guess corporate bonds now too), which injects more USD into the system. That new money tends to make its way into stocks, because there is nowhere else that pays.

You kind of already explained it, rates are at 0, equities are by far the best investment right now. If I were to hand you a million bucks right now, where are you gonna park that cash?

the fed is literally shamelessly batshit insane to inflate a bubble of this size for this long, and lower interest rates clearly don't help.Jimmies (?)“Likely revolt”, “violence”, etc. 

I highly highly doubt we’ll see those things come to pass. Our world is more connected then ever before and more prosperous then ever (ie- less ppl living in poverty) and the main reason for this is an interconnected globe both digitally and economically. 

More likely is a Biden presidency, which according to Bernie will be the “most progressive presidency since FDR”, economic reform in the form of more regulation, a push for more environmentally friendly grid/society, minimum wage raise, slight retraction of the market (of which I’ll buy up the whole time), and a soft (read- non violent) reset that sets us up better for more sustainable growth in the future. 

I don’t let the people at the top live in my head rent free. I focus on my own personal financial independence and prosperity. I’ve a decent paying full time job, multiple investments and a side gig power washing rich ppls homes (in which I make a hefty chunk of money). It’s worked well for me. 

As an aside, during the last major global pandemic the market also saw good returns.I’m actually interested so please don’t read any sarcasm into my questioning;

An increase in total number of buy orders happening, combined with websites talking about people buying a stock (like happens with wsb) means that a number of different algorithms are more likely to buy in this scenario.

Yes, total volume is small, but they absolutely can impact the price, though indirectly.This has been the mantra for forever now, but... I'm not so sure it's true right now.But it is increasing.   (WSJ: [Individuals Roll the Dice on Stocks as Veterans Fret](https://quotes.wsj.com/AMTD))

Bottle caps.For an individual, depending on their timeline, it doesn’t really matter if that’s true. Anyone that retired thirty years ago was right to ignore this problem and enjoy the massive gains. If the Fed can pump things another 30 years (probably possible) then I’m all set. That’s past my average life expectancy anyway.

There’s also the possibility that the long term gains — which go back a lot further than 30 years — have been driven by real improvements in human productivity. The market may be erratic and over reactive, but our economy really is a lot more productive than it was 30, 60, or 90 years ago.I'm not talking about nominal returns lol -- inflation adjusted there are lots of markets that are not going up endlesslyAll those countries didn't have to spend 4 months convincing their public to wear masks, and aren't still shutting businesses down.I’m on Zoom all the time.You can zoom out as much as you want on Nikkei, they are fucked. We might be too if we honestly believe there are no limits to our debt and Fed balance sheet.I mean, what's a decade or three for people with 30-50 years of earning potential?  Totally schooled me there!I'm not so sure it matters that much.  In the 70s and 90s markets were far less connected.  Now all the central banks are busy printing, and most of the S&P 500 have substantial overseas exposure.  I could see an argument that they're similar to various sectors of the economy, but it's scarily interconnected.Adjusting for inflation, starting in 1991, until the present, and including dividends, which are re-invested gives a return of -0.122%.Ok, so including dividends re-invested and CPI, the Nikkei-225 from December 1989 to today has returned... NEGATIVE 40.196%.

[https://dqydj.com/nikkei-return-calculator-dividend-reinvestment/](https://dqydj.com/nikkei-return-calculator-dividend-reinvestment/)Sorry, let me be clearer.  Look at the 70s in the US, where the Dow essentially did nothing, or the Nikkei index from the 90s on.  In both cases the market saw no gains over a long period of time.  A decade for the Dow, and still nothing for the Nikkei respectively.Well in my old neighborhood saw 3/4 of my neighbors sell in a 1 year time frame (2017) and move to the sticks or go vanlife, they cashed out on real estate inflation big time.

Sadly, until the population of the US peaks we wont likely see a true peak in the housing market.  See Japan.Not for everyone who isn’t in the housing marketThat's the thing. We might just inflate our way through the "recession". Can't short stuff which is going up in price.

The weird thing is this might be the most sensible thing for governments to do... inflate away the debt, whilst forcing banks to offer low interest rates.

Does make you wonder how much asset prices can decouple from everyday things like food and fuel prices without kickback. Think governments have made it that they will prop prices up at all costs, whether or not this is is a sensible decision long term... who knows.If 5 months was a sufficiently long period for things to return to (more or less true) value, investing would be much easier. But 5 months is nothing. 2008 took 1.5 years from ATH to bottom, not even talking about recovery.Well I'm in the UK... and house prices just spiked again despite the massive layoffs.

That said, might be somewhat biased data given the housing crisis over here.

Noticed food prices starting to go up too.

As much as we like to think that the stock market != the economy, it is coupled, and it can and will make it into circulation if you print enough.Possibly? Plenty.

Or maybe it won't.>What we are seeing isn't market growth. It is inflation, currently disproportionately effecting assets.

I would say almost all of the inflation is going into assets like stocks and housing. What else are rich people supposed to buy? 

The housing inflation problem can be solved by buying a house within the next year, like you said inflation is going to make housing completely unaffordable so get in while you can. Also, buy a larger home so if you have kids there will be room for them to stay living with you once they get older (they are going to need it).but they haven't. Inflation is not moving, the money being pumped in is merely replacing previously spent money, not augmenting it. And the world, despite it all, is still denominated in US Currency, which ironically is only strengthened by its performance during this crisis.Trailing stop at 8-10% assumes that you have gains to stop out. If you put it lower than that you don't get stopped and if you put it tighter intraday swings can wipe you out. 

Gap down on open is always a possibility but I assume we are still talking TSLA right? Should be enough buy orders to cushion that kind of activity.Or the time it happened again in 2015 because the regulations weren’t sufficient...or the fact that it’s not an anomaly at all to have stop losses taken out by money markets.  Sure if you change your statement to say 8-10% stop loss and only referring to major indexes, yeah you are pretty safe with that type of stop loss....but that wasn’t the point you made.It doesn't have to be a Flash Crash to be an issue.  All that needs to happen is for buyers to stop buying, and for it to gap down.  Right now, in normal trading, this market has an issue with a lack of volume, because a lot of people are sitting on the sidelines, it only gets worse when the market goes into free fall.

Not only did they immediately abandon those strategies, they actively called anyone sticking with those strategies morons.buy index funds when? Only nasdaq is above its feb high. What allocations should you have in indices? How about emerging + other markets indices? 

your strategy sounds good on paper, but you have to know what to buySo you're pulling from your Roth to pay rent? With the profit you made from stocks?You do know the money that’s sent into corporate bonds are just loans to the actual corporations right? Not only do they have to pay back that bond, they’re surely not using the money to buy stocks, it’s so that they can stay alive, given that revenues are slashed. Are you forgetting that there is a global pandemic and consumer spending is down?Inflation has already been happening. Look at the prices on groceries! They've doubled where I live. Plus stores are considering to add "COVID surcharge", if they haven't increased their prices to soften the blow from less customers coming in and half the capacity. These prices are here to stay, and it's unsustainable!One man's debt is another man's cheap (free!) money.  The market couldn't care less about debt taken on by the largest companies, e.g. the S&P 500, these companies generally have very strong balance sheets and it won't hurt them.  The jobs don't need to come back in a short time.  Interest rates are so low that the present value of future cash flows is barely discounted.  That makes poor earnings in the next couple of years almost irrelevant.  In addition, there's so much money flowing from bonds into equities that you're going to see very high P/E ratios for years.  Investors will accept lower yields on equities than in the past because there's no good alternative.Who cares about debt when interest expense is zero? I rather hold a smart company that takes the opportunity to lever up as much as possible nowNo you see how it works, people buy stocks to make money because there will always be some greater fool happy to purchase their stocks at a higher price!>Yes, but who would buy stocks if they don't expect them to grow?

Corrections usually last more than a day though so curious to see what tomorrow brings.Usually an index but if it's a large-cap company that can move an index on its own it also works.Retail investors are piling into options and leveraged etf like TQQQ and that’s magnified their ability to move the market.  Deep OTM options also force MMs to hedge their exposure.Retail is up a lot though - apparently on some days they end up being 20% of volume. That's pretty unheard ofLet's stop pretending like the amount they move is small. This is just not true. Along with professional clown Portnoy and Barstool, it seems like everyone who used to bet on sports is now betting on stocks, and people that didn't even used to bet on sports are now investing and betting a little on stocks.

~$400B is spent on sports betting every year. Another ~$100 billion is spent on casinos and lotteries. 

I'd wager about half a trillion in retail is jumping into the market, and that's why you're seeing a bonkers rise to ATH in NASDAQ and ATH seen just before the crash, when the actual economy is bleeding out on the field.And equities gambling is a zit on the fixed income marketsI don't even bet either, I just consume the media and that time takes away from time I could've spent investing.

Then add on inflationary forces and QE, and we're in some really weird valuation territory.

Could values fall? Yeah. Will they fall in real terms? Probably. Will they fall in numerical terms? Maybe not.If you insist on believing the official inflation figures we'll have to agree to disagree.Anyone that was invested over the last month would have that cushion in the Nasdaq 100. But yes there is definitely a loss risk in the first few weeks of investing even with a stop or trailing stop order that I agree with you. 

I wasnt particularly talking about TSLA. I dont know if I missed something but I didnt think we were talking about TSLA specifically. TSLA would probably actually be a bad candidate for stop loss order considering its probably the most volatile big company right now so swing are more fierce. I was more referring to something like QQQ with protection against a possible bubble exploding.Maybe you read more into it then I meant or that I wasn't clear enough but I never changed my opinion.

What would you put a stop loss at? 0%? I don't get what is so different in my last statement. 

Look if you want to be in cash and miss the current insane bull market because of a risk tolerance of less then 10%, then yeah it's the right move for you. I just don't see why someone would miss the ongoing bull market because of a potential crash when there are ways to mitigate the risk to a level anyone in 100% should be comfortable.

Also come on. You're proving my point again that people just want to prove they know stuff by mentioning the small crash of 2015...It depends what stocks you are looking at I guess. Most big companies have more volume then their average these days from what I can see.

BTW no buyer would equal a flash crash. What do you think happens when no-one wants to buy? Even in the reddest days of 2020 there was always buyers. It doesnt mean what you are describing wont happen, but its incredibly rare. Especially on bigger companies or index ETF (since we are talking about the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100)lol true, and MSFTPart of it of course.I've been cash for uhhh six months now? I should have stayed in but I don't regret it, I made a decision based on traditional market factors. Unfortunately for me, traditional market factors don't matter anymore.RemindME! In 12 months> buy index funds when?

Whenever you can, which for most Americans is whenever they get a paycheck.

> What allocations should you have in indices? How about emerging + other markets indices?

There is plenty of research about this as well. And in the vast majority of cases, broad stock market indices perform well regardless of allocation differences I.e. someone who’s 60% US and 40% international will be fine, someone who’s 40% US and 60% international will be fine too. VTSAX lets you hold a little of everything and isn’t a bad choice either.

My point isn’t to say there’s an easy asset allocation to beat everyone else’s allocation, rather, to say that buying and holding outperforms selling and trying to time market crashes in the vast majority of cases and you don’t need hindsight to see thatYes, if it comes to it.



And not quite. I'll withdrawal the contributions, for sure, as it's penalty free.



But, I believe withdrawing profits aren't currently penalized due to covid-19; if that's the case, I may consider withdrawing some of the profit too, if not all.>You do know the money that’s sent into corporate bonds are just loans to the actual corporations right? Not only do they have to pay back that bond, they’re surely not using the money to buy stocks,

There is no restriction on what the companies use the loans for.

AAPL bonds were specifically for stock buybacks and the fed bought them.

The loans are dirt cheap, plenty of companies use loans to fund buybacks, its the whole reason we got into this mess in the first place. Companies went into heavy debt to pump their own stocks, and when this recession came around they had no savings at all.I am legitimately concerned about what America looks like in 2-3 years. I feel like about 10% of investors I talk to realize that we are already on a collision course. Yes, the numbers may go up 5-10% over the next few months, as we approach all time highs or even make new highs. But the boat has a leak, and it’s filling up faster than we can bail the water back out. Our economy is not headed toward a good and stable outcome, and any bull market that is reaped over the next year will honestly be bittersweet additions to my portfolio.Wait, what tax savings?Cattle?Dang you were so quick! I did edit my response so you may want to check it out haha. 

And my dude, I live in dc and participated in the marches and continue to support BLM.

However, if you read the original comment, then cherry picking data isn't going to work out so well.  Large parts of time the markets have gone no where, so the idea it's always a bull market, you just need to be patient isn't true.  A decade (70s Dow) or three decades and counting (Nikkei) would be devastating to most people's retirement, assuming they had the patience to stay invested after such a long period of no returns or even losses.Well Gen Z apparently

Isolated islands might use stone wheels as currency, but that is because that isolated island does not have regular trade contacts with other tribes. What you use as money is an arbitrary decision, but if you have space for thousands of tribes on your continent and they all make arbitrary decision as to what to use as money, the things which are easily transportable, durable, and divisible will likely proliferate because you can always hold onto them until you need to trade with that particular tribe. Gold is valuable because its chemical properties mean that if you have an ounce of gold today, you will still have an ounce of gold in a century, which means that if you hold onto it long enough eventually somebody you come across will want it again.You’re not trying to sell me insurance, are you?Canned food make better head smasher.

So no, not just Rodney King; and, detriment to your point that we’re on some sort of breaking point where violence (to a level you’ve yet to make clear but have made it sound very ominous) will be widespread and society/the stock market will crumble, it never happened in all those other cases (some of which were way worse then our present situation) and won’t happen now. 

Rona would be a better answer as to why you think the market will collapse; race violence isn’t.Nothing?Yes, but those companies are expected to grow and do either of those things in the futureIf the us suffers from
Hyper inflation then Europe and Japan will follow. They print just as much."Expected" is the right word, do you know Uber is already like 11 years old and hasn't hit break even? lolHahahahaha noIf it was never expected to make money it would be worth $0The BOJ is literally the largest shareholder of Japanese equities  and Europe is crippled every time Greece sneezesMust be a europoor if you think there’s even a remote chance of eu reserve currency lol. What shit for brains."Priced in" amirite? MSFT and AAPL were profitable after 1-2 years. Look at WeWork now, was worth alot - then worth nothing lol.

NKLA insiders are selling more shares to the public because they know its overvalued, same as what Hertz did before bankruptcy.I don't think you understand exactly how much panic printing the fed has doneHey I own puts on Uber and it seems they are the ones going to 0, not Uber

Amazon took like 18 years to become profitableyou really don't understand global banking if that's what you think.The euro zone has negative interest ratesAmazon took like 7, just chose to reinvest in r&d, expansion and marketing. Also how many companies can really replicate Amazon? For every amazon, there will be 999 that dont. Not great odds.Maybe you can explain how massive real inflation doesn't harm your standing as a currency? You've become inherently less stable and valuable.

And no, the "official" inflation numbers don't mean shit.

We got a letter from them that said:

 Due to the recent Covid situation and much slower then normal collection's from our customers we have been very restricted from a cash flow stand point which has made it very difficult to get payments out to our vendor base. 
With that being said we are working diligently with our Bank to put together a schedule for the vendor base that we can present to them in the coming days.   We will be completely transparent with you and show you when you will receive payments over the next few months to get you paid down ASAP. 
I do apologize for the delay and look forward to setting up a meeting with you to provide this schedule as soon as it is completed.$300b company made $100m net income. If you take away 6 zeros from each number, that’s like a business valued at $300K making $100 for the quarter104 million profit after selling 428 million in regulatory credits. I.e. they are back to losing over 100 million dollars per month. Gross margin is lower than last quarter, too.I'd like to know what percentage of those profits came from these short shorts:


https://shop.tesla.com/product/tesla-short-shortsi thought i was a genius for buying at 300 and selling at 500.  ...not a genius300 billion market cap vs 100 million profit...jeez. Tesla would need to be growing by entire multiples to justify their stock price. 

Congrats if you’ve profited off the stock but holy hell is there a downside risk even if Tesla grows at 10% a quarter.Here in California we could use the tears of short sellers to hydrate the parched earth.

- Only 4% automotive revenue decline vs a year ago, during a time of unprecedented economic disruption. Most legacy automakers suffered volume declines anywhere from 20-40%. The Federal Reserve expected annualized GDP decline of >30% during the second quarter. As the world moves to recovery in second half of this year, especially in Europe and Asia-Pacific, Tesla sales are going to really take off!
- GF Shanghai is a gold mine, and should be the key factor in pushing automotive gross margin above 25%.
- Operating Cash Flow actually grew from $864M a year ago to $964M, despite a 5% total revenue decline. The Fremont shutdown cut Tesla's operating cost, while reducing its inventory (days of supply) from 25 days last quarter to 17. 
- It ends the quarter with $8.6 billion in cash vs $14 billion in total debt, of which about $4.4 billion is deep in money convertibles. If Elon Musk wants to play it safe, Tesla can dilute 1.5-3% of its outstanding shares and wipe out all its debt completely. It will then feature a fortress like balance sheet unrivaled in the automotive industry.

If you are a $TSLA investor, congratulation on the ride so far, but I would take some money off the table after its S&P 500 inclusion.How this doesn't trigger a cold-eyes audit prior to S&P inclusion would amaze me given the volatile nature of the stock.$104M income on $300B market cap? Nice!Fantastic. I hope they continue, any disruptor to the status quo is welcome."A wonderful company at the wrong price is a terrible investment"

- Benjamin GrahamIt just seems insane to me with their current valuation. Shouldn't any good news already be priced into their incredible valuation? The amount if growth required to meet their current valuation means investors expect explosive growth for 30+ years. Why would news about a factory or news that they beat earnings estimates etc effect the already lofty growth expectations by this much? I was already iffy at 1,000 but now's just closing on 1,700. Personally, I'm just sitting this out  hating myself while it goes higher and higher.

I just can't make myself invest in something that I logically can't understand. It just feels like throwing money at a casino.Coming from a Tesla bull, it is still scary and so hard not to consider this a bubble.Everyone in this thread pooping on bears. Let's see how the stock price moves tomorrow first, eh? Bunch of first timers in here...  

Edit: and there it is. As of 10:30am or so, the price is down relative to yesterday's close. Investor sentiment and expectations matter more than the raw numbers vs. analyst estimates.This is a new company in a century old industry with extremely high fixed costs - it's going to take a long time to turn a GAAP profit. GAAP metrics are not incredibly useful for analyzing or understanding a high growth company. 

To me, this is similar to Amazon years ago re-investing billions into it's infrastructure, hardware, and business plan that nobody else understood or believed in (or both). Tesla is rapidly building it's production capability and burning cash now to meet the demand of 2022 and beyond for electric vehicles. It's also got a ton of upside that is really hard to quantify, and that's where everyone questions the valuation. In ten years we might laugh at ourselves for doubting Tesla. 

I'm not saying the valuation is right or wrong explicitly because the future revenue are basically impossible to quantify. Add in all that fed money fighting COVID, and you can't make heads or tails of any prices, let alone Tesla. The current profits or even the readily predictable profits don't justify the current prices. However, the optimist in me will point out that Tesla has been "dead in the water, headed to $0" for 10 years now, but by the end of 2021 it'll have 5 gigafactories on 3 continents. At the time of the first one it was projected to be the biggest building in the world. That's a huge infrastructure achievement, and if they get execute their plan, an amazing success story. 

The question remains - is 1600+ a good entry point? I think if you believe the company will be around in 30 years, then hell yeah.Does TLSA still have the waiting list for cars or can I go buy one immediately more or less?Seriously shocked. Guess I’m an idiot.Still the fundamentals are off. I wonder how high can this go and will maintain it.I can’t ignore Tesla anymore I just bought 2 shares 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️Without emissions credits they lost money. They still aren't making money selling cars.Fun part is they are actually losing money..Newb question - if TSLA gets added to the s&p 500 due to enough profitable quarters will that cause the stock to shoot up even more b/c all the s&p 500 index funds will have to buy in? What rank/share of the index would it be expected to have right now?I just want to live long enough to see humans set foot on Mars.

Make it so Elon.Musk at the conference call when asked about earnings - thanks for you question but let me tell you about this new product we are bringing to the market, did I also say that we are putting a cyber truck on mars, and we are creating a cyber boat?Bought TSLA under $100 a few years back and sold it this week.I look forward to refreshing my personal capital stats tomorrow.The thing that blows my mind is they did this without breaking delivery records. WowWhat am I missing here? sales down. production down. deliveries down.  solar even.  2 plants currently being constructed and 5 in development.

ok, the regulatory credits, but what else? What are they doing right that I am not seeing.If you keep putting extremely low expectations, yea they will beat them lmao

Look at q/q, huge drops in eps and decent loss of rev. They are priced as if they are growing significantly each q and they arentNot bad! Bought back into it for a little after selling right on top of Elon's 420 stunt in 2018. Elon is a crazy meme lord and Tesla has some Q/A issues right now, but they have so much potential.Sold naked $2100 calls.

Doesn't that indicate massively increasing costs?[removed]Great job to all of the people at Tesla putting their blood and sweat into developing a great product.

Congrats to Elon for being nearby.I bought another tesla share right before close, nice!I still think TSLA is on track to hit $2000 sooner than later. This company has immense potential and keep getting me back after I book the profits.Knowing how this year has been, Tesla crushes earnings estimate, down 40%.Anyone think my 7/24 $2,500 call will be up in the morning?Is it too late to buy into the stock?Imagine if all these shorts decided stop shorting...no more short squeezesok I get it there were regulatory credits and this quarters results aren't ideal. 

But don't forget they were forced to close manufacturing for 3-5 Weeks of the 13 weeks in this Quarter.

This result is at least slightly positive overall but not a great indication of how Tesla may perform in the future - positive or negative.That's neat. Quick question: why is a luxury brand with a profit of $100million selling at $1700 a share?sounds like fudging the numbers to me.

3 cent expected earnings vs actual 2.18? No way thr analysts made such a big mistake.

Theyre working off data provided by tesla, it doesnt make sense that theres such a large difference.Profitability of 1% up 3.72% after hours not exactly a smash is it?

On Monday up 11% why? No reason just a normal trading day for Tesla. This stock is being manipulated like crazy. Goldman knows all the Robin Hood stop losses and watching them set them off is just crazy. Earnings were priced in long ago at $1k. Where this stock goes is whatever the institutions decide. The major blow will be when it's not included in the S&P because it's way too volatile and overvalued. 

Unbiased opinion because I don't trade this stock. It's so manipulated stay away.This stock is a piece of junk. The higher it goes the more I short. Elon is a conmanThink this will bring the rest of the ev market up?TSLA earnings going to have much of an impact on other EV companies?

Hm, that's some fun math.Anyone else notice the triple 69’s?? Was that on purpose?? Anybody???.......Dad?This is also a problem though isn’t it. Tesla IR helps to set expectations with the “analysts” that cover the stock. So the two options for consistent earnings blowouts are:
1.	They sand bag the shit out of the earnings then blow out the expectations
2.	They literally have no clue how the earnings are going to land when expectations are set and models are run.ZzStill doesn't justify this valuationWho in the world is buying these $$$ Tesla cars in an epidemic???The Elon cult is really keeping Tesla up.Isn't 430 million from tax credits so they lost moneyTheir Q2 update: [https://ir.tesla.com/static-files/f41f4254-f1cc-4929-a0b6-6623b00475a6](https://ir.tesla.com/static-files/f41f4254-f1cc-4929-a0b6-6623b00475a6)Without tax credits for selling EVs, they would have shown a loss of around 350m.So, based on TTM EPS figures, TSLA P/E is 800? Has there been any other company with such high levels?I think now it'll be eligible for s&p 500.....

Still I think the valuation is too high but they can achieve it if the scale manufacturing properlyTesla revenue hit $6.04 billion during the second quarter of 2020, with about 7% of that, or $428 million, coming from sales of regulatory credits.
CFO Zach Kirkhorn said during the company's earnings call Wednesday that Tesla expects revenue from sales of regulatory credits to double in 2020 versus the prior year but to decline over time. 
Without zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) and other regulatory credits, Tesla would not have been able to report a four consecutive quarters of GAAP profitability, a milestone it reported Wednesday that meets the qualifications for Tesla to join the S&P 500.

I've been a believer of Tesla but $1600 is too rich. Tesla investors are loyal, and this loyalty will eventually either reward or will go up flames. 

[Tesla Zev ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/23/teslas-sale-of-environmental-credits-help-drive-to-profitability.html)Thanks for sharing this. All the positive news made me take a position today.There are two possible events that would make Tesla worth $300B.

\- They invent an exclusive battery that makes their EVs deliver 400miles range and cost cheaper than gasoline cars.

\- They have an exclusive reliable self driving system.

They need to have a game-changer technology either on cost or value add, and no credible competition for at least a decade to to be able to monetize it and take huge share. Otherwise, it's not even a $100B company, much less $300B one.I won the betI'm a Tesla bull, but how realistic is it for the stock to dip around $700 or lower? I only own like 3 or 4 sharesWill this reach $1800 tomorrow?I’m not trying to say one way or another if their books are fishy but I’ve seen several comments talking about how their numbers are fraud and others responding saying their audited by PWC and blah blah blah. 

10-Q’s are not audited. So just because their 10-K is audited and checks out fine doesn’t necessarily mean that their quarterly reports are perfectly fine. 

It is highly unlikely that their is fraud going on in their quarterly reports but just wanted to point out that these are not audited numbers.Pretty novice, should I buy a couple of more shares at market open? Or no?Inb4 we find out the books are marinated and then cookedCan somone fill me in and tell me what app I should use to start investingHow about looking into the long term and just buy and hold the Fucking stock,instead of the stupid yolo mentality.FIY IF YOU WANT TO YOLO SOMETHING,YOLO THESE NUTS.I bought 2 shares back when it was around $225.


I bought a house, instead of investing that money in tesla, and renting an apartment.

What a foolish man I am.This reeks of insider trading.No one is talking about the 500 lb gorilla in the room.  This is Tesla’s 4 profitable quarter in a row.  That should guarantee entry into the S&P500.lol at this sub. Mouth breathers still trying to explain why this is all fake and smoke and mirrors after almost certainly getting absolutely crushed by buying puts.$3000 mark coming up in mid August.Thank god I stayed away from this stock.  Would never have been long... not ever.  Phew.Is it too late to get in on TSLA?Where your dumb bears at now?2250c 7/24

What price does TSLA have to climb to you think to make profit despite IV crush?Best comment in this threadIt's funny because the current market is essentially a bubble that enriches the largest existing shareholders at the cost of Main Street and the average taxpayer.

So by definition you are correct lol.This comment really makes you thinkOr even a Tesla car.This is true of every single stock.I’ve been bitten buy the just buy the dip bug many times. It’s really stupid to try and buy dips since you’ll never get into the market and the next time a price peak happens you’ll miss out. Long term most stocks go up so they are typically peaking anyways.

I had friends say don’t buy amazon at $2,000 and TSLA at $600. We’ll they were wrong lol.Lots of puts and nuts crushedlol every time i want to buy tsla puts i can't stomach the premiums... and it's always for the best.Don’t worry everyone who bought calls is currently screwed tooYou geniuses should probably take the hint by now.LOL. Why would you buy puts besides to hedge existing long TSLA position?There goes my put credit spread ;')

(wish i bought a call now, but tbf, i hadn't messed with options in months because I got in the red haha)tbf calls are fucked too by the looks of it.why would you buy puts in this market ?Even if Tesla didn’t crush I’d imagine it would still have killed it, this stock is something else, don’t gamble[deleted]If you made such a bet, you *are* the putz.Dude I sold my positions yesterday when it dipped below 1600, and of fucking course, it runs right the fuck back up.Lol idiotthere was some guy in here talking hot shit about selling naked calls because the premium is so high  


i imagine he hung himself by nowWhen will you people learn that you DO NOT short Musk? When? Seriously. I’ve heard this shit from people every time Tesla reports earnings and it literally never plummets the way you stupid people think it will.

Tesla is the future. It’s that simple.[deleted]Hahajust buy them againI don’t know why anyone keeps betting against Tesla - it’s not a rational stock regardless of earningsWasn't this already priced in ?Didn't move enough for calls either...Going to take 7% and then close.Serves you right for betting against daddy ElonBelieve it or not the stock can still go down if you beat earnings. A lot of times the analyst estimates aren’t the market estimates for earnings.There is hardly any guarantee that this report will cause the price to go in any particular direction.I hope for you those aren’t naked puts.I was just wondering how Tesla managed to deliver 100 extra vehicles a day to create that level of revenue surprise. Turns out most of the revenue surprise is not from operations. Bummer.And those are probably credits collected over multiple quarters.In this quarter not shrinking by 25% is an achievementWhich should be concerning, seeing as their business model with pre-orders likely makes the real impact of the economic crisis lag quite a bit.What's better to prove a point then have FCA give you profit. Tesla is Amazon in the early 2010, no profit all expansion.What’s strange is that no analyst are calling them out on this. If they have to report profit per unit sold like every other automaker, they would be screwed. But oh shhhh...carbon credits. Wow, Elon is executing brilliantly. Wtf? He literally should have kept the Fremont factory closed for the entire quarter and would have made more profit. They lose money on every car sold.it's the regulatory capture that's helped Tesla break lockdown and inhumanely open his factory during a global pandemic to get that profit.Someone should correct me if I'm wrong but I was under the impression that these credits are part of the deal they made with Fiat to finance their new factory in Germany.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-09/fiat-will-effectively-fund-tesla-s-german-factory-baird-says

So this "profit" is really just them either recouping losses from a past quarter, or preparing to offset a cost in the near future.Wait, so businesses are only allowed to be profitable in specific ways now??? Keep moving those goal posts lmao>.it's the regulatory credits that's helping Tesla to get that profit.

Not a great idea to invest in a company whose main source of income is regulatory credits that are a political hot topic and can be repealed at any time.Does anyone else feel like these credits shouldn't be transferable? If GM can't meet their own emissions standards why do they need to pay this "bribe" to the government using Tesla as the conduit? Can anyone explain this to me if I got it wrong or if I'm missing something?The big catch.I'm pretty bearish on Tesla right now, mostly because I think it's overvalued.  I've been expecting them to be profitable this quarter for a couple of weeks because I have faith in their ability to do enough financial engineering to make a "profit".  What *will* surprise me at this point is if they make a profit in Q3 or Q4.  They have pulled a LOT of profits forwards via various tricks to make this number, to get included in the S&P 500.  There is no such incentive to do so in Q3 or Q4, and likely they'll do a kitchen sink quarter or two with all the stuff they've moved around.So is Tesla a car company or an emissions credit company at this point?Oh no, a business you can own getting free money? Let's bet against it! 

Watching you guys losing your minds and your money for 9 years now. It's great.Profitable even excluding credits. And remember that Fremont was closed for half the quarter.Isn't this a quasi definition of some level of socialism? I may have my terms mixed up and understanding wrong but what do you call it when the government basically provids funding to a business. This does not really seem like true capitalism.Typical, big companies bully smaller suppliers 😕Every corporation with a half-a-brain CFO sent out letters after the shutdown to suppliers asking for lenient billing while simultaneously sending out letters asking for immediate payment on invoices from customers."We appreciate your hard work, but if we pay our suppliers and our employees what they're owed this quarter we can't make a play for index inclusion."> collection's

I hope that's not in there...If it makes you feel better, musk unlocked a $2 bln pay package today because of this quarter.> collection's from our customers

Since when do they give people cars without taking the money first?That's happening across the planet - everybody is trying to keep cash on hand, which means calling in debtors and trying to avoid creditors.

It happened before Covid too - companies will always try to keep cash on hand as much as possible: if you can get paid instantly and delay your own payments by a month or two, you've gained a big ol' pile of interest and securityDo you think Tesla became a $290,000,000,000+ market cap business by writing cheques?Ah, interesting that is their reason.

My girlfriend works in AP and they can't currently pay certain companies because they can't go into the office to cut checks (since not everyone has heard of ACH apparently)...Sounds like a big short momentas an upstanding company, they will be compensating you with interest.... maybe not.Next time get payment when you deliverIt's not an expense if Tesla doesn't pay it. At least on this quarters financials¨and for those reasons, i´m out¨If my grandmother had wheels she would be a bicycleAh yes, thank you for dumbing it down for us pours.You gotta appreciate the potential of the lemonade stand. They are automating their offering.Not a healthy company. They're burning so much cash with very little cash coming into the books. I feel like Musk is going to start hiring cost cutting accounting sharks to bring Tesla into profitability.In the middle of a pandemic, when competitors shrank 30% and lost tons of money.Id say if I was the owner of that business and sold it at 300k I would be very happyIf dragons den is any indication, it's massively undervalued! BUY! BUY! BUY!Best comment here!Ya but maybe this is by design? Think about it, Elon is not interested in profits he is interested in getting everyone in a planet saving car.

Plus, as long as you break even then you're focusing on growth. Who cares about profit when revenues keep skyrocketing and they are already sitting on billions cash on hand.

Edit: no joke, literally just came across this after posting... very weird timing... [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musk-doesnt-want-tesla-to-be-super-profitable-as-it-soars-toward-a-300-billion-valuation-2020-07-22](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musk-doesnt-want-tesla-to-be-super-profitable-as-it-soars-toward-a-300-billion-valuation-2020-07-22)Maybe I should open a lemonade stand and ask venture capitalists on sand hill road for 6 figures in investment.> that’s like a business valued at $300K making $100 for the quarter

But in a year its $1k, in 3 years $10k and in 5 years $100k. And suddenly your investment in the $300k company with "only" $100 income seems pretty good, dont you think?How do these work? 

Tesla gets credit per made car with no C02 imprint and Sells it to automakers that produce traditional cars?“Let’s just ignore that and  value it more than every other auto company on earth”Regulatory credits are legitimate income amd are expected to continue until everyone starts making EVs.Then whole premise of green saviors bite dust? By selling credits aren't you helping those companies to produce vehicle that make emissions?financial alchemyMmmm, tastes salty!Lol. So if Fiat Chrysler narrowly misses profits because they had to pay Tesla regulatory credits, would you say AKHUALLY tHeY mAdE a PrOfItHow are they doing on the warranty? I remember some people weren't happy how they were accounting for that last qtr.

Nothing wrong with the accounting...it's like how movie studios get creative. you take advantage of whatever is present..w/o breaking the law. Does the S&P 500 peeps even care about how they do their accounting.So, Tesla earns regulatory credits for each EV they sell, and they sell those credits to other companies who buy them to avoid paying fines for their CO2 emissions. 

But you insist we shouldn't count that legitimate stream of revenue, because Tesla wouldn't be making money off the credits if there was no demand for them? 

Yeah... that's not how it works. That's as hypothetical as the "Tesla's demand has peaked" arguments from the bears.COVIDI like to think about regulatory credits like this:

1. Tesla makes money if you buy their cars.

2. Tesla makes money if you dont buy their cars.

Governments are phasing out ICE cars either way. So why shouldnt Tesla make money on non electric cars until the inflection point occurs.That's not that awful given the global situation at the moment. I expected deliveries to be cut in halfNot how it works. Regulatory credits are priced in. Nice try. Tesla is fine as they beat expectations. Meanwhile, they grow rapidly.Aaaand those who missed out on the stock will still search for reasons to be negative when Tesla profits during a global pandemic which caused legacy auto to lose billions 🤣🤣

Never change r/investing[deleted]Why do regulatory credits magically not count as income in your mind?And the price... $69.420
If we would have done stuff like that back in school loli just got the joke. they're trolling short sellers. 

even says

>Enjoy exceptional comfort from the closing bell.

amazing.Still waiting for pairProbably like 5% or something jaw dropping for their market cap.ughhhh, her belly button is giving me the creeps.Smart though. You bought when it was undervalued, and sold when it was overvalued on fundamentals.
800 is around where the fundamentals are right now., Only 4 out of 30 analysts have confirmed a buy rating this month.180 ->360 here.I'm a very old man, and this feels too much like Cisco. Great company with two-digit annual growth rate in the nineties but back then priced for the year 2050.Its one of the most obvious bubbles I've seen

They've already released their "mass consumer" car and still can't make big profits

And competitors are going to catch up sooner or later, looks like soonerI can't see them ever delivering even a solitary 2% return at this market cap.So buy puts.. but how far outAnd they will. In publicly known plans there is enough new factories to multiply their output by factor of 5+, not to mention they yet to enter few be segments (Semi, Cybertruck).

I don't know why it is so confusing for everyone, it's public knowledge. Tesla is rapidly accelerating.Why Uber has any value with their terrific income statement then....Some people just don’t understand growth companies.You didnt buy AMZN back in the day for sure.[deleted]In the middle of a pandemic, when competitors shrank 30% and lost tons of money.Not just shorts that will be crying. A lot of people bought stupid call options as well. People going to learn the dangers of otm calls and IV crush.*cries in BTC*But why we only up to 1650 /:I've thought about filtering Tesla and TSLA from this sub before, but man it's such a trainwreck you can't help but watch anytime *something* happens, good or bad.So obvious that every quarter 90% of this sub is glued to the Tesla earnings praying they can finally say “told you so”. Well, better luck next time tough guys.Anyone getting any sort of any action on Tesla, whether they are buy, sell, or short, is gambling.I actually had to check that this wasn't a wsb postand ARKWArk has been divesting from TESLA for awhile now.Tesla should do a secondary right now. Immediately. A BIG one.>Only 4% automotive revenue decline vs a year ago, during a time of unprecedented economic disruption. Most legacy automakers suffered volume declines anywhere from 20-40%. The Federal Reserve expected annualized GDP decline of >30% during the second quarter. As the world moves to recovery in second half of this year, especially in Europe and Asia-Pacific, Tesla sales are going to really take off!

I agree they're more recession proof than their competitors because they cater to a higher end market, I think anyone with half a brain could expect that. But by the same token that also caps their near term potential value (or it *would*, ***if*** they were putting out any substantial amount of cars compared to other auto-makers)

I don't own or short Tesla, I like the company but I think their valuation is downright insane.Revenue decline was only 4% because it is a niche luxury brand and the only people who can afford them havent been fucked by the economy yet.Best comment in entire thread.I’m in it for the long term. Have been on board since 2015. Don’t plan until selling within the next 5 years. 

 Buy and hold! So simple and so awesome!A reasonable comment??? But but but rEgUlAtOrY cReDiTsGenuinely curious why you say this?A 300B dollar company only made 100m in a quarter and you are saying this is excellent?What if I told you Tesla was moving into China so they could play with the numbers a bit more than usual?

The Chinese don’t have the purchasing power of Americans. That’s the biggest factoid and why the US is so great for launching businesses.They're audited by PWC. I doubt there would be any sort of additional audit required beyond that.Cold eyes?They must really suck at cooking the books to be reporting losses for the last 10 years. What a stupid theory. I can’t believe people still regurgitate this shit**Elon must be cooking the books here**, I want to know who the auditors are and if they are doing their job properly. This looks like a massive pump and dump to me. I won't be surprised if Elon starts selling at the top before the whole thing comes crashing down like a house of cards.Not even on cars lolIt's a steal!wait? Are you being facetious because thats an awful ratio.Good pointsI’d rather play blackjack than buy TSLA.  This is bitcoin all over again.It is, but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it! I've been slowly selling to where my remaining shares are just profits now.The most fanatical Tesla bulls in here remind me of people going to a casino for the first time, putting $100 on red and hitting, and saying "Gambling is easy, I just doubled my money in less than a minute. Why doesn't everyone do this?"RemindMe! 1 day (BeArS rUlE)One of the big environmental factors I never see anyone talk about is governments tentatively banning ICE vehicles after a set date. BC in Canada has them banned as of 2040, 10% of all cars must be 0 emission by 2025. Germany and a bunch of other nations are jumping in on this. I think Tesla will be a huge player in the long game just due to attrition. The other vehicle giants models will be legislated out.Where is the money coming for all the giga?Depends on the car. Usually 4-8 weeks for a fresh order, but they often have new inventory available for immediate delivery.Thats it? Sell you car, house, wife and kids. we goin on a trip in our favorite rocketshipCongrats! I just cant bring myself to take the dive  but I wish the best for all Tesla investors. It really is an amazing American success story and I hope they have a run to rival companies like Ford and GMC.That a pandemic shut that main factory down for 40 days is irrelevant yesIt’s pathetic to saying “well that money doesn’t count.” Because they sell the cars they do, they get the credits. If they didn’t sell the cars, they wouldn’t have the credits to sell. 

But hey, I guess you guys have to try and find some way to spin this.Technically they are charging less because they can subsidize the customer cost through this strategy.  If they charged more per car and didn't track the emission credits they *could* be profitable.  It's just a business decision and gives them the ability to build the brand value while decreasing customer costs. 

As the credits go away they will inevitably bring the vehicle cost up or add other revenue streams to compensate (such as FSD).Oh so if a source of revenue didn’t exist their numbers would be different? What a brilliant take.they still made more this quarter than every other auto manufacturer...You get the emissions credits for selling electric cars tho?Over 800m in operating cash flow. How are they losing money on cars? Even if that figure includes the credits, half of it is from cars. The business is in a growth stage where they have high capital investment, and they are expanding production even further to meet the increasing demand for model 3 and Y - currently the only reasonably priced options in luxury electric. You can't just subtract credit income from GAAP net income to get to the "true income" of Tesla as a business. 

They also achieved these numbers in times of unprecedented economic hardship and uncertainty, while their competitors suffered much larger declines in demand. There are definitely promising signs of performance in this quarter.

The valuation is way out of whack. But so is every company on every exchange right now. It also prices in speculation on promising but unknown amounts of future revenue for things like self driving, more widespread electric vehicle adoption, solar storage and roofs, and battery technology improvement. The first and last in that list could provide dramatic revenue and profitability boosts. I think the price now assumes a high degree of success on those factors, which is what makes the stock so hard for people to buy.In a global pandemic black swan already extending 2 quarters? You dont say???Idk, a lot of the older stocks I've seen added to sp500 didn't have a massive jump or anything. Doesn't seem right, maybe I'm looking at the wrong info?Typically inclusion in the index is not a net positive for stocks in the prevailing 6mo to a year. Tesla will also be I believe the largest market cap to be added to the SP500 ever. Passive flows will be positive but many also may take gains so too hard to predict but I wouldn’t bet on it as a stock price catalyst.Hundreds of millions of shares have to be bought and tracked by indexes bro.  Think SPY ETFs,  retirement funds, automotive funds, energy funds, hedge funds, pension funds, investment funds etcAlso I cured cancer and I'm Jesus.Uh, what?Cypercatgirl is when Tesla take over the world.Because they had more revenue and profit on previous quartersDuring a pandemic!!!Context, sales and production down because of the factory shut down. 

I own a Tesla, their technology is the best on the market and growing fast. Likely they will win full autonomy. Think about what that could mean. Uber could be wiped out, add that business valuation right into Teslas. 

EV's, its on trend and the market is growing, with no good EV competition on the market and I'm very skeptical that anything really compelling is coming soon. Tesla has great margins as an auto maker. 

And you kind of answered your own question, but growth. Look at their YoY growth numbers, its insane.[removed]>2 plants currently being constructed and 5 in development.

There you go.dude, it is a pandemic... they were shut down for 2 out of the 3 months.Extremely low expectations? Lol we are in the midst of unprecedented global crisis.Do eco friendly nickel miners exist?They're an American automaker...Just had to turn into a meme stockLol, at what price would you like it after a 250% increase this year?“Priced for perfection”because they actualy loss money this quater. I bet tomorrow it  loses 5%Have you ever read or seen "The Smartest Guys in the Room"?Pffft, it's a paradigm shift, bro. Fundamentals don't matter.they are building 3 new factories right now which are setting records for largest buildings. Plus pandemic shut them down for 2 months...You know, maybe you’ve already forgotten but there was this thing called a pandemic that made most states go on lockdown? And that’s false actually, over the last 10 years they’ve increased revenue by 50% year over year on average. They’ve grown faster than Amazon in the same time span with similar revenue starting points.

Edit: why are people downvoting facts? Because it doesn’t fit the narrative?I don't have a position in Tesla one way or the other, but it's humorous that the Tesla bulls are dunking on people after a $300 billion company made just $100 million in profit and continued to lose money in its core business. 

There is absolutely nothing in this earnings report that suggests Tesla's current value is reasonable.[deleted]Should buy more right at open50/50 on hitting $2k before noon tomorrow.!RemindMe 1 weekNot if you believe the estimates that it could hit 15k by 2024.Yes$295b market cap.   Mature companies have a 15 p/e ratio at best, closer to 10.    Does the market expect $25b annual revenues?3 cents was the average. There were published estimates from around -2 per share to 1.50 per share so nobody had a clue. I would say it’s kinda common with young high growth companies.Sounds like it’s working for you, keep it up!You know. Some people enjoy pain. Nothing wrong with that. You do you!👀Not sure but NKLA went up almost 2% after market. It dumped 8% today and Trevor just got approved today to buy shares at these prices along with warrants gonna expire in August near earnings. Gonna be a wild ride imoNot everyone is losing money.Would say its a little late now unless you’re planning on holding this one long term.I've heard of robinhood but im not an investor. Just here to read... literally everyone is talking about that.Its not guaranteed. The comittee has discretion and has exercised it in the past. If everything was plain jane, then absolutely Tesla is in. But I believe because of the market cap and the recent runup and the volitility this is new ground.I assure you that this has come up pretty much every day for at least the past three months.It’s also a bunch of lottery winners who think they’re financial geniuses for buying the right scratch off.never too late. I thought at 900$ it was too late.Oh boyThat money is 100% gone as I type thisHow is someone saying they would've bought a stock in the past the best commentSpot on, most people buying tesla now are retail investors. Once theres a shock of some kind with tesla, i believe retail investors would panic sell.Ah so capitalism?literally none of that makes sense. this is the dumbest subreddit by far. no wonder u all lose money.They said it was a bubble at $300 then $600 then $900 and it keeps going. It is true they are technically overvalued if you only look at car output etc, but they literally have the best tech in the world and are working on things that other companies can’t even fathom. The model 3 is already the most efficiency, safest, has ota updates, more storage than others in its class, incredible acceleration, great handling, all glass roof yada yada yada and in a couple years it’ll look like an old car because Tesla tech moves so fast.

I buy stocks based on whether they have competitive advantages and right now Tesla has so many it’s hard to even list them out. Most other ev’s still have a push start button for crying out load. Please explain the reason for a push start button in an ev. Tesla also has the most efficient hvac system on the market, why did they do this? Why not? Elon builds towards physics not the market. While the other mans are trying to figure out what the market wants Tesla is reading up on thermodynamics for figure out how to make the best ac on the planet.I reread many times but couldn’t understand. English isnt my first language though can you please explainBro my puts are fuckin' eviscerated and my nuts are tiny and sad.The nuts were pounded into NutellaSome people are into that kind of thing.Good. Puts are un-American.

Calls to the fucking MOON!I don’t like it when nuts get crushed.I'm trying to focus more on credit/debit spread because of this. 

Made a lot of unrealized profit back with my call option back when TSLA first hit 960 but it was downhill from their for me. Least I was able to take that as learning experience.Collect premiums then!I just buy deep OTM and pray for an accounting scandalYeah no shit. It'd have to rally another 100 to even be worth it. Glad I stayed out of this one.Basically only theta gang won today.Missed the bull run on TSLA. Eager to make a play but at this point there is no way to tell where this stock is goingThat IV crush - a lot of people skip that class...A little confused on this one, can you explain?I don't understand why? Wouldn't their calls be worth more as they become more in the money?Some guy posted on this sub about buying 5k worth of puts and calls because he expected to swing one way or the other, hope he didn't end up doing it but if he did, please do an AMAThey all feed off of FUD.It has plenty of pull backs if your willing to take profits theres plenty of opportunity for bears to make money on put spreadsYeah. Just like Albert Einstein said after the dotcom crash, ”markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent”.Some people want to perform the function of taking on unnecessary risk. Thank them for their service.Gambling.A put credit spread should have been profitable? Or do you mean a put debit spread?My puts were near the moneySo he loves stock manipulation?Tesla's bouyed up by a crapton of investor sentiment and a fairly reasonable business model. It's not generating enough revenue to be worth what it's worth, but it's going to generate enough good news to keep the bubble going for a long time.This is the post that people will link the next time musk/tesla screws something up>Tesla is the future. It’s that simple.

I swear I heard this in 2017 about Bitcoin. 

I don't think anyone disputes that Tesla's current valuation represents speculative mania (Musk himself said this about $1000 ago), they've just got the timing wrong.This is nonsense. Even accounting optimistically for future growth, Tesla is still way, way overpriced. Take a look at Tesla's balance sheet and try to extrapolate 50 years in the future. Anyone who does the math will plainly see this stock is a bubble.Did a spread😉It was a spreadliterally the same accounting story every quarter

yea they're growing, but it's hard to justify even a $400 pricetag, much less whatever the fuck is going on nowYes, but the more vehicles Tesla makes the more regulatory credits they get to sell don't they?Yep so they can goose their numbers to tweak it to kill the shorts on weak quarters. Why do you think they released those short shorts for? He has an ace up his sleeve.nope. They are part of ongoing contracts that Tesla has with Fiat and other manufacturers.Pre-ordering is mostly a thing for newer models - actually buying a Model 3 now is no worse in terms of lead time than buying from VW, Toyota etc in many cases

My Tesla was actually delivered faster than the two Audis I had previously to it.

Going to the dealer and buying "in stock" can be faster with other brands, but most Audis are sold to order nowadays too, for example.... You know people are able to cancel their pre-orders at any time, right?

Also the pre-orders for Model S, X, and 3 are all gone now.

As Elon said in the earnings call today "Demand is not a problem".I don't know if it's moving goalposts so much as realizing the ephemerality of this GAAP "profit". There is a finite number of credits available for them to sell and once they're gone, they're gone. Eventually they're going to have to sell products for more than it costs to make them, a feat they've never achieved since becoming a public company.Not really..I have no investments in Tesla. This is just something I observed when I was going through their recent Quarters numbers.Lol, I don’t think it’s investors that are moving the goal posts.Yeah but Tesla bad according to this sub so facts are irrelevant, only the narrative countscan confirm, even large established corporations will report how amazing they are doing, having back to back record quarters...and ask their suppliers for longer payment terms in the same breath, no shame.

So you can increase quarterly dividends every year but now you need 120 instead of 90 days for payment or you will run to competition ? Yup, seems only fair.When big companies cant push costs onto consumers, they'll push them onto vendors and suppliers. It just works.Yup.  At work the procurement dept seems to not give a whit whether we're getting value for what we pay a vendor, but you can bet they're on top of those payment terms.  They must get a bonus based on how many days they can drag out the other company's AR reps...No it’s only Tesla that’s bad - this subthat's not how accounting works... It still shows up as a commitment on your financials.> slower then normal

That tooThat gives Tesla more money that they can use to pay people.I have contemplated it but no courage.  I shorted $bynd, knowing it was way to high and made out like a bandit there.  Difference is, there is much more faith and devotion to Tesla and it has momentum at the moment.I'm pretty sure it's an expense of they are on accrual basis instead of cash basis.

Like vertical integration, the decreasing cost of electric cars do to Wright's law, and being the current leader in self driving capabilities.Bulk of their credit sales are coming from FCA and that drops off dramatically in 2021 and doesn't extend into 2022 under their current plans.  They might get another quarter or two of elevated revenue from them but that's pretty much it.While that is true it distorts the actual profitability of the underlying business....which in this case is selling cars. If your only in the plus because you sold almost half a billion worth of credits your underlying business was neckdeep in the red. Which is not really what you want to see as a business increases in scale.but isnt that exactly what everyone is doing?it's our tax money at workYa but the sale of regulatory credits to other car companies seems kind of crooked in a way does it not? I.E. not very legitimate income and definitely not operating income which is what it was reported asAre they now? They have now one and half billion in AR, when they shouldn't have basically any with their business model. It begs the question if there is any counter party actually paying these regulatory credits or if they are just some extrapolated future credits?Regulatory credits are a single government decision away from disappearing, and the low emission and EV market is the future, every car manufacturer is getting as far into that as quickly as is feasibly possible for them.

This profit is uncertain, and even if it wasn’t it is unsustainable in the long term. The bottom line is Tesla still needs to figure their shit out, this is a stop gap, not a definitive solution.There are countless cases where people went to prison for "creative accounting", though. And yes, S&P do care about accounting practices. There is no way TSLA gets included without a very thorough audit.Common misconception. Amazon was dumping their profits into infrastructure and R&D. They weren't losing money.It is income, but not from their core business which is selling electric cars...Haha edgyI don’t get itHow are the fundamentals at 800? Does anyone have a DCF sheet for TSLA?sigh.   its really hard to be mad when you take that much profit... but yeah.  i think im just going to take tsla off my watch list lol\>cisco

I always mistakenly think Oracle owns them.They're being priced based on solving self driving, and their coming status as one of the biggest battery manufacturers on the planet. 

Having said that, their valuation, especially if it doubles from here, relies on every best case scenario playing out.The factory was closed half the quarter! Competition argument is lame, it's been the same for years.Energy sector is the next shakeup.In the middle of a pandemic, when competitors shrank 30% and lost tons of money.I think everyone at this point knows their share price is unsustainable, and going by their finances this quarter they don't have a sustainable business without selling credits.


But their stock keeps going up and has done despite everything in the last year. It's impossible to predict because it could tank if literally anything happens, from actual business issues at Tesla, to failed launches at Space X, or Elon calling someone else a pedo.And for what strike? Buying $1500 puts won’t be so great if it shoots up to $4k before crashing back down to $1500.Ubers stock is still down 25% from the IPO price they came out with, you can buy a stock that has profit potential but this rate is very risky.I own growth companies but you wanna buy Tesla for their value in 2030 be my guest.Nope and if I had I’d have sold it instead of waiting 20 years for it to pop off around 2016 thanks to AWS and a global pandemic to solidify it.

How’s your IBM stock doing?You think one better quarter makes Tesla worth 8 times General Motors? Now I see who’s buying Tesla at $1,600 a share. Good luck.tesla really had a 300m loss, they just made 100% margin on sales of "credits", 400M worthI couldn't believe those outrageous premiums. I just couldn't bring myself to play either side at all.The year didn’t end babbyyyWhen a broken clock outperforms you lmfaoIt can only go up. Soon Tesla will be traded at $500k per share, and net income will be $20 per share.Serves them right for doubting daddy ElonI only realized after this comment...

In retrospect the abundant use of full sentences should have tipped me off.and ARKQSays who? They have to keep TSLA below 10% of their portfolio because of their ETF policy, so they constantly have to sell to get back under that.

Ark has a $7000 price target on the stock.They're not divesting, they're rebalancing. They keep each position under 10% so they have to sell some Tesla to keep it under 10%.Still their top holding.This is complete BS. They only sell TSLA because it grows so much that it would make up too much of their funds. 

Please check the facts before spreading false information.Profitable, cash flow positive with $8B in the bank. In the middle of a pandemic.

They don't need the money.Why do you think tesla isn't doing this?What's a secondary?[deleted]did you read that last point ??

>Tesla can dilute 1.5-3% of its outstanding shares and wipe out all its debt completely. It will then feature a fortress like balance sheet unrivaled in the automotive industry.

this is super tempting for a CEO that already said "stock price too high IMO" when it was at HALF the current price, less than 3 months ago...> The Chinese don’t have the purchasing power of Americans.

lol?Lol, what an American thing to say.

China has more wealthy people than the US. Try to get information from something other than Fox and CNN.Yeah just to play with the numbers, nothing to do with the fact that ummm i don't know.... China is the biggest electric car consumer????>The Chinese don’t have the purchasing power of Americans.

Let me guess, you grew up with the US education system? The nonsense comments I see on this sub sometimes....I mean...I'm sure people said similar things about EY audits...yet here we are.Considering the volatile nature of the equity, and the fact that these Index Funds would be required to purchase/sell it in relation to market cap for their funds, I 100% would not be surprised to see the S&P withhold inclusion unless they got their own audit.It’s a term to describe someone who has had zero knowledge/experience with something. In design, it’s when you get a third party to review your design before construction to make sure you or your counterpart(s) haven’t overlooked something.Like when your eyes are so cold you start buying tsla in after hoursSo if they lost $500M but only reported a $100M loss, it's fine?

(Hypothetical question)Or like, maybe with the bonus potential for Musk and possible inclusion into the S&P there’s more incentive to maybe take some liberties this quarter.Their auditors are pwc, a firm whose revenues and profit greatly exceed that of Tesla’s and have no interest or benefit in aiding them “cooking the books”... absurd.Sorry for your loss boys. I know it hurts. Stay strong. LMAOHow many bags of shorts are you holding?I seriously doubt that they're cooking the books, but there is this:

> the Silicon Valley auto maker found a way, helped by the sale of regulatory tax credits, to eke out a $104 million profit in the second quarter.

That could probably be sold as "government subsidies". But in the end I don't think it matters much.I assumed this was known...?there is no auditors, we might never know the truthBut it's Elon ;)reminds me of the bitcoin craze in December 2017 to be honest.

Everyone was a fanatic, the memes, the irrational decisions. We are not there yet with Tesla so I can see it going to 2k this week.

What I think the guys at s&p 500 might do is slowly sell their positions and then announce that they are not adding it, causing a crash. They will then buy in and add it to their index a quarter later.

Or Elon will just dilute the shares. Something is coming that will pop the bubble.Bingo. Basically Tesla is on trend with both consumers and governments. Thats the whole point of the regulatory credits, to nudge automakers in the right direction and to benefit those companies that are doing the right things.Investors and creditors, regulatory credits, smaller business segments like solar, charger network, mobile repairs that have good margins. 

I'd be surprised if they don't do a secondary offering to get even more cash on the balance sheet, which is in pretty good shape as it is. 

They have a long long way to go to get cash flows to support the current valuation, but if self driving comes to fruition in the next decade, there is no way to predict the economic impact.Clearly such an undesirable car.  They literally can't make them fast enough, with no-haggle pricing and no discounts...Lol I’m just in college, basically like me doing thatWhich reduced their cost. Presumably they could have made more cars with it open. I don't know what their production schedule was. But given they lose money on every car sale they actually benefited by shutting down.

Likely not true. I don't know what their fixed cost structure is like. But they did cut pay, eleminate bonuses and such, except for Elon. So that helped quite a bit.The spin is they lose money on every car they sell. Conveniently you're excluding 100% of operating costs. But hey, I guess you guys have to try and find some way to spin this.If that's true then expect lower demand as prices increase.The people investing into tesla aren't the most experienced or logic drivenThat has to happen every time a stock is added to the index but empirical evidence doesn’t show that’s supportive of stock price in the short term after inclusion in the index. Not saying it won’t happen but typically it isn’t positive for the stock price.Musk is basically a liar.Your submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

I am trying to see in the financials what I am missing. Why did they lose money last year, but make a shit ton this q?You are correct, but does that make the metrics good? Does it bode well for future metrics? Is CA shutting down again? Are the down payments on vehicles going to be forfeited? There is some pretty significant short term headwinds, imo.And what? The earnings prediction went from $2.00 to negative, thats a gigantic undercut.
Also they were profitable due to credits onlyYeah that's probably it. A German car feels like an actual piece of work instead of a playmobil toyJust wait until SpaceX goes public. It will be TSLA on super meme mode.Hey I just bought in at $1680, why isn’t it at $2,200 right now?

/sBuyers weren't rational up until today, why would they start now?I would like it to be $1700-1800 AH, thank you very muchI think it's because the other, smarter guys already left..?LOLHow is revenue linked to building factories?

Tesla sells car online. They had enough inventory. I feel growth flattened pending new demand for model YI'm surprised you're not being hit with more downvotes.I'm guessing the downvotes are because it's not true.

The deck they showed at yesterday's earnings showed flat revenue through 2019 and 2020 up to now. In fact this quarter they are down on revenue, 5% iirc.

This indicates that without the carbon credits, they would be making massive losses (over 100million). In the same timespan they have launched two new cheaper models, and continue to have massive hype, so why has their revenue not increased? It's clearly not for a lack of demand since sales continue to rise. 90k deliveries I think it was. This all points to insane costs. It's not crazy to think this company is basically propped up by Musk.

I don't know what the pandemic has to do with the last 2 years but ok.Look, another silly boy that likely thinks Tesla is an auto company, and cannot see farther than their own eye-frames from their thick glasses in regards to future profits and exponential growth. This smells like Amazon level stupidity when everyone was calling it an online shopping site "similar to eBay", and we all know how that turned out.Walk me through how 964M of operating cash flow is losing money in the core business. Isn't the whole point of evaluating operating cash flow separately from investing and financing activity to sort out the cash contribution of the operations (ie the core business) from the cash required for capital investment, and capital structuring, so that during periods of rapid change you can predict how a company will operate in steady waters? 

GAAP measures are ineffective measurements for a company in this early growth stage.You must be living in a parallel universe where no one is shorting Tesla, because last time I checked, there's a $20,000,000,000+ hit for Tesla to crumble.Everyone that convinced themselves that they wouldn’t turn a profit this quarter are now starting to realize every fund is about to buy some Tesla shares and likey going down below 1500 tomorrow.Can’t wait, I am already excited. Will sell few to book some profit and then wait for the next ride to 2500.15k?

I’ll have three of whatever it is they’re drinking, but they’re probably the guys who said bitcoin would be at $500k by now so I don’t know if I could hang.I genuinely think that's conservative. TSLA should be worth more than the rest of the S&P combined by the end of the decade.10 pe? Maybe highly leveraged oil giants.wouldnt really call tesla a young company.

im still on the bandwagon that tesla is doing something with their books.

although i am a firm believer that the market is generally not wrong with price, just not sure what the market sees really in their valuation.Found a 17 year old on Stocktwits with 1 contract bragging about doubling his options to me. Wants to see where I “get 100% returns”. Baffling how ignorant people are when literally all the greatest investors say the same thing and it isn’t yolo options with crazy high IV.What if it pumps to 2k tomorrow[removed]Forbes had a real interesting article asserting that since the start of the longer uptrend in October 2019 the price has been pushed by shorts having to cover as well as retail investor FOMO.That is what is driving Tesla stock price right now. Retail investors. One bad news and the stock will tumble.Retail investors do not make for any appreciable movement, volume, nor pricing. Like less than 5% of volume is retail.There was a 10% shock when Elon said “I think the stock is too high”It's hard to explain, but I'll try.  The sentence its self is a [truism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truism); Of course the price of a share purchased 3 months ago would have increased value to that of a share purchased now, because they'd be shares of the same type.

  But it's designed to make you think of several contradictory ideas while evaluating the meaning at a glance.

* Buying 3 months ago would have been a mistake (it was too expensive to "afford" wasting "gambling" money on).
* Buying would have been a good idea because I would have a lot of money now if I _sold_ now.
* Buying would not have made a difference because I wouldn't be selling now. (And, it's probably going to go down in the future.)
* Buying now is still a mistake (it is still too expensive to "afford" wasting money on)
 
The 4th one sort of circularly leads back to the 1st one, because we are in the same situation we were in 3 months ago.  But this would imply that we _should_ buy now (perhaps if we make dubious assumptions like past performance being future indication, or having FOMO because we know a lot of people have FOMO which will drive the price up).

It's like all of the _pro_ and _con_ arguments in one efficient sentence that is not particularly pro or con.Do you guys lack the capital to actually buy TSLA?  Because that's what I call entertainment.That is the expected outcome of buying lottery tickets. There is no point in buying single options, since you are making a purely directional play. This is doubly true when you by OTM options hoping that the become worth something over time. Everything is stacked against you, when you do that. 

Look into selling options, especially strategies that combine trading different types of options at the same time. Even when you want to go net long in one direction, doing it through strategic options plays will massively reduce your risk and improve your profits in the long run.Aaaaaand it's gone. Apparently wall st had a few mins last night to figure out that Tesla is using some exotic methods to run up their EPS. Frick.This is the way. My spread is doing great!lol robinhood requires $100k+ collateral to sell puts, and i don't have 100 shares of Tesla to sell covered callsi dunno why im in this sub...i have no idea what this conversation is about hahaThat's why u buy vertical spreadsBeen theta gang for a few months, just started getting into earnings trades. Interested to see how much I make tomorrow. I only sold one Iron Condor on it for 3.85Doubt it, a lot of people going to get their faces ripped off there too> Missed the bull run on TSLA. Eager to make a play but at this point there is no way to tell where this stock is going

2011: "Missed the bull run on TSLA. Eager to make a play but at this point there is no way to tell where this stock is going"

2013: "Missed the bull run on TSLA. Eager to make a play but at this point there is no way to tell where this stock is going"

2016: "Missed the bull run on TSLA. Eager to make a play but at this point there is no way to tell where this stock is going"

2019: "Missed the bull run on TSLA. Eager to make a play but at this point there is no way to tell where this stock is going"

2021: "Missed the bull run on TSLA. Eager to make a play but at this point there is no way to tell where this stock is going"

Etc.If you buy and hold for 5 years, IMHO TSLA is an amazing investment. Even at 2000.Feeling the same. Sitting this one out and seeing where it goes, I do wish everyone the best of luck. 

I still think its way over priced.Until people realizing TSLA has become a standard car manufacturer. 

The manufacturing quality of the cars is not the best, but the capability to charge outside the US at Superchargers and CCS2 chargers gives Teslas cars a very nice incentive for a buy. In 5 years it's likely to have changed from first adopter buyers to consumers of an electric car. The Chinese too are trying to put their electric cars on the European market.This was my opinion on Amazon for the longest time.... Now up 200%. 

Tesla is on shakier ground though in my opinion.

 It is not a "household name" that everyone depends on like Amazon had become when I finally bought some shares.I spent 15 minutes typing out my best explanation using the Reddit app and then it crashed and deleted everything and I can’t do it again lol. 


http://tastytradenetwork.squarespace.com/tt/blog/implied-volatility-crush

Read that and let me know if you need anything clarified. Basically call options on TSLA were very expensive because the market expected TSLA to make a huge move after earnings. Since they didn’t move much the options will not be worth nearly as much now.http://tastytradenetwork.squarespace.com/tt/blog/implied-volatility-crush

As an example, while tsla was trading near $1600 today, a call contract expiring this Friday with a strike of $1600 was trading for around $100, meaning that tsla would have to move above $1700 to break even if you bought it. Since tsla is trading around $1650 the option is going to be worth less even though it is more in the money, because the earnings event pumps up the extrinsic value side of the option price. Now that earnings has come and gone the expected move will be less and the option will be worth less.I considered selling calls myself. I was looking at calls expiring this Friday with a strike of $3,000. You could sell them for like $1.35. Tesla nearly doubling to $3,000 would mean an influx of like 300 billion in two days. Couldn’t believe people were buying those..Morningstar gives it a 1 star rating.Hard for most people to rationalize a company SP going up 5x on declining revenues. Q4 2018 was peak revenue and has been downhill/flat since then.This is my put. There are many other like them, but this one is mine.Yeah profitable.
OP is bummed with his puts but I'm fine with my "puts," hence the " ;') "and J Powell/Musk just mushroom smacked yousomething tells me if you can hold them in the morning you should make out..

could be a sell the news type event.Fundamentals and valuation should converge...eventually. It's the "eventually" part that kills peopleNot sure if this needs explained to you but Tesla’s reach transcends automotive. They’re an ENERGY company whose most popular offering (currently) is a car. They aren’t a car company. They have the most advanced technology when it comes to renewables in a wide breadth of sectors.

Your “gotcha” comment that investor sentiment somehow inherently creates a bubble proves you don’t pay attention to the stock market. It’s ALL about future outlook rather than the present. It’s ALL about sentiment. The days of “solid financials” causing a stock to moon are over. Sorry."Elon Musk shoots up Heroin on Joe Rogan Podcast"Lol okay dudeThere’s a $6700.00  prediction by a savvy trader I was following. She predicted this during March when it was 400.

Her points are compelling. 

I think it could hit that in a few years easy. 

But even 6x earnings isn’t the greatest. But it’s a fairy safe bet for what you can get
Back.[deleted]Because, like most growth companies, the price is based on intangible future outcomes like AI or grid-level battery storage. If you're using Toyota as a comparable, you're going to have a bad time. There is literally nothing you can use to make an apples to apples comparison. This is purely investor sentiment and technical analysis.It's just a meme stock. It's going up because it's trendy for it to go up right now, and it has nothing at all to do with book value, or future profits. It will crash at some point, but like always, no one knows if that is tomorrow or 5 years from now.  
It's whenever everyone gets bored of it.Awhile back I bought Tesla at $180, sold it at $600 because I though it was so overvalued that soon it would fall back to $200-250. My current price target is around $350, so I’m glad to see others with a target near mine - feels like everyone’s gone mad with this one, jeezDidn't someone calculate that Tesla would have to sell their cars at 200k a pop to justify their "current" (of a few weeks ago) valuation?

I think I saw it on this subreddit.The short shorts are just Elon's way of throwing a middle finger at the SEC by dropping hints of the quarterly results. He's done this before, such as with a tweet "Chairs are underappreciated".So around 400Million for the next quarters, too?Demand for those credits shouldn't be bullish if there aren't the ICE being sold to offset them.Little Rich boy over here...Well, I am pretty sure demand will be a problem, so there's that.The way I look at it is this:

- Tesla is desirable (I have one, people stop me to talk about it ALL the time)
- Teslas are expensive because of expensive batteries
- Batteries are getting cheaper over time

Put these things together, and I think it's fairly clear that the credits are really just bridging the gap between EVs being expensive (due to the battery) and them being directly competitive with ICE vehicles

So yeah, credits are finite (although I don't see them being irrelevant for at least another decade)... but by the time the credits dry up, batteries will be cheap enough that Tesla are competing on price anyway.

Tesla and VW are both there-or-thereabouts with hitting the $100/kWh mark on batteries that allows EVs to start being competitive with at least the more expensive half of the car marketUh huh. People have been claiming the credits will disappear for years. Legacy auto has still not made significant progress toward zero emissions. 

They have 20% profit on a Model 3 or Y sale and have now ramped to mass production. Look at the trend. They will be a free cash flow machine from this point forward assuming no more shut downs from covid. They will also be claiming more and more FSD revenue as they roll out updates. 100% profit. Like seriously this is not hard people. Buy TSLA and profit. Stop being a salty sideline observer.Tesla's core business is now regulatory credits. Get with the program!1) Leading an industry in zero emissions so much that you are able to subsidize other non compliant legacy manufacturers to the tune of 400mm a quarter is genius. I don’t know how you possibly spin this to a negative. 

2) They are still growing revenue at 40-50% per year so the second half of your statement is ludicrous. Just imagine what they will do without factories being shut down and ramping up two new gigafactories. Stop drinking the TSLAQ kool aid.How PE ruined the world...cash flows baby. Read'em and weep. Stretching payables is very typical.My company in a nutshell. Our stock price is at an all time high despite our sales being down 30% due to Covid. How they managed this was by furloughing a majority of their employees and not giving raises this year.Nah its just mostly big companies that have the power to abuse payments dates, not only teslaThey rescinded bonuses that had already been earned but not rewarded. They've also gone to suppliers in the past and received retroactive rebates. I do agree that you can't just refuse to pay a supplier to make money appear, but Tesla is claiming to have billions of dollars of cash on hand. There shouldn't be an issue paying out if nothing fucky is going on.But not in cash flow.No. Musk used cash from Tesla to pay himself $2 billion. Instead of paying himself, he could have paid outstanding debts to contractors/vendors.source: https://youtu.be/8fgNixllFJgFord? They cut that sweet dividend[GM](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2020/07/gm-sales-figures-numbers-results-united-states-q2-2020/), [Ford](https://fordauthority.com/2020/07/ford-motor-company-sales-numbers-figures-results-second-quarter-2020-q2/), you name it.Thx. 

So AR is increasing, revenues are down and the only reason they are showing profit is goverment money. 

On top of that a very high valuation.So Tesla is just selling credits for dollars. This seems like something I would see in a video game.So when the big automakers are all churning out EVs and stop buying credits, what happens to Tesla then?Honestly, I had 0 clue about this. Thanks for the link. They make money because other companies don’t sell enough electric cars. Interesting. Is Texas one of these handful of states with these regulatory rules?The current valuation is ridiculous, but no, not more than every other global auto company combined.Last I checked it was something like a quarter to a third of all car manufacturers. So not quite. Still insane though.More growth than all auto companies on earth combined :)aren't we there yet ? atleast the top 10 biggest in US+EU markets ?You think too small. TSLA bigger than APL incoming.We all know, still overvaluedFine, you want to get really pedantic?  Its a tech company that makes a profit only by selling carbon emissions credits to other automobile manufacturers.Why? FCA has to actually sell low emission vehicles. Fines in Europe are getting higher every year...This is a superficial argument.   EV manufacturers trying to disrupt the internal combustion engine business would be expected to 1) take advantage of a favorable regulatory environment from Western governments and 2) heavily spend on R&D to advance the technology.   Musk would be doing shareholders a disservice if he weren't doing these things.   What the market is learning is that you can't go from internal combustion to EVs just by welding an electric motor to the chassis of an existing internal combustion vehicle.   Pretty much every mechanical component has to be purpose-built for this, and most of the top minds in the field are currently on the Tesla payroll.

Congrats to everyone who was long TSLA.But why? Literally the whole point of the company is to reduce the carbon emissions of vehicles, and Tesla is now capitalizing on the fact that there is real economic value created by NOT producing the CO2 footprint typically associated with cars. This is just a natural market dynamic at work, nothing distortionary about it. This is exactly how things should work. Governments are willing to pay to incentivize this behavior.It's literally other companies buying it from Tesla https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a32346670/other-automakers-paid-tesla-record-354-million/If it was cheaper for legacy auto to ramp their own EV's to lower their fleet emissions, that is what they'd be doing.  There continues to be a market for EV related credits in America and Europe which Tesla can leverage, because they sell far, far more electric vehicles than anyone else.

I don't expect this to be a strong revenue stream for them in 5 years, but they inked a deal with FCA last year worth around $2b, so I expect they'll be able to recognize credit sale revenues in the ballpark of q1 and q2 of this year for a couple more years at least.

Still waiting.

For now I guess their strategy is to pay Tesla to compensate for being so far behind in technology. Bold move, Cotton.

Edit: LOL. Wrong link. Here, try this one! Less micturition!

https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2010/06/will-audi-put-tesla-out-of-business/No, it's being paid by their competitors who are too incompetent to make viable EV's.Clearly you don't understand how these credits work.Why is it crooked? That's the whole idea. Gas-powered cars are still much more profitable, so in order to modify the incentives the government is taxing combustion engines and giving a rebate to electric motors.  
  
Edit: I agree that no one should really consider these tax credits as a form of *profit,* that is definitely not the intention behind the policy.Gas carmakers don’t pay for their externalities, you do this is a way to equalize that in part.they have a contract with Fiat Chrysler and a few other auto manufacturers to sell them credits.

On the earnings call they said the credits will double this year before starting to very slowly taper off.regulatory credits are coming from all over the US and Europe, not a single place. You also have many countries and cities completely banning gasoline and diesel vehicles over the next 10-20 years.[deleted]A while ago, Elon got his panties in a bunch when several famous short sellers were saying that his company was fundamentally flawed and unsustainable. Ever since then he has made many references to "burning the shorts" etc. on twitter. Apparently this fake product is another way to "get back" at the evil shorts. Don't bring that evil on usI have a tesla, "self driving" or you mean highly capable advance cruise control?200m profit last quarter, no competition, limited virus effect

Longing Tesla is like betting on the largest selling computer company in 1982 that's finally made its first annual profit (0.04%) in a decade and then expecting them to deliver profits for the next two decades.It's not lame, its completely valid, and it has been right for years.I mean their profits shrank in halfI bought TSLA in 2015.  no reason to sell now.2008 was 12 years ago, AMZN was at $40.[deleted]Lol - we’ll be sure to inform Tesla that money doesn’t count.[removed]Pretty much all the ARKs except ARKF I guess.And they still get ~700 million from his performance reward.Probably Elon's dick measuring contest with shorts and the bad press that would accompany a large offering.Think of an IPO, but take out the "initial" part. It's a new round of shares to sell on the public market./u/Objective_Stage wants the board to increase the float, that is, put more shares on the market.Lol k budcan this be done by friday?Isn't it good to have a bit of debt for tax reasons?As a complete newbie, what does this mean?Americans have more disposable income and make more... but that’s just facts.If you know Chinese culture, outside of some of the truly wealthier (comparable to upper middle class US), most people invest all their money into property investments. They tie all their wealth up in property and try to pass it down.

Their actual purchasing power compared to people who make equivalent in the US is lower because they choose to purchase single large item rather than what most US people do (collect trinkets and shit)China =\ Chinese. What are you a 3rd grader? Chinese are people of China who have significantly less purchasing power than Americans.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita

Chinese = people of China.

American = people of the United States.

What is wrong with you all?1) it’s disingenuous at best to compare us-based audits to foreign audits, and 

2) Short of a PCAOB review, there isn’t really a more authoritative auditing body than a big 4 firmBut my point is that they're already audited by one of the biggest names in the industry. In practice you really can't get a better audit done. The whole point of having an audit done by PWC is so that lenders or regulators can use that audit opinion to gain comfort over the accuracy of their financials.Gotcha, makes sense.So like blackbox or clean room implementation ?No skin in the TSLA game but there are plenty examples of auditors screwing up public company audits. Wirecard is still in the news. Not that pwc has incentives,  just that overworked 23 year old accounting grads have no idea what they are doing or are incompetent. It's not impossible for pwc to be wrongLMAOTesla is the future of mobility and the sky high valuation might be justifiable for such a visionary company... but if you think Tesla exists to make shareholders rich, you are bound to be disappointing

his allegiance lies with advancing mankind by electrifying transport and making us an interplanetary species. H[e has demonstrated a few times how he doesn't give a shit about SEC regulations](https://shop.tesla.com/product/tesla-short-shorts) and other manmade artificial limitations like that. He literally says the only laws he adheres to are the laws of physics. He will definitely cook the books if he thinks it might further mankind....and the majority of his followers would applaud him for it (I would too). 

The fact his CFO's keep walking out is also a massive red flag.Is that not aggressive accounting then? Is the market dumb or something?Yes there are...Is this your first time trading?Investors? Do you mean shares offered in a secondary?


Creditors as in loans?

Rest of all you said goes under revenues in the balance sheet. Margins are not enough to build even one gigaThey literally just discounted the Y 3K this past week.Right? Like other companies make a shit ton of cars nobody wants and then everyone down the chain haggles on oversupply and eats into profit. He sells every car made and that would probably be true if the every model was $10,000 more than current price. And that’s before self-drivingYou know teslas are discounted by $5k right now in China. This was announced a couple of days ago.There's definitely more demand for Tesla cars than they can supply. 

There's a small ramen place nearby that always has a huge amount of people waiting to order. The demand for their product is far higher than they can supply. Very desirably ramen.You don’t have to presume. Of-course they would’ve made more cars if not for their main factory being shut down 40 days of the quarter. And they don’t lose money on every car sale, their gross margins are like 20-25%. Those margins are normally invested back into growth and the China factory, Berlin factory and Austin Texas factory shows they’re still investing more than ever. 

Look at Q2 earning reports of other automakers soon and you’ll see cutting back sales doesn’t equal cutting costs in the same manner. But a lot of companies reporting losses recently could’ve given you that clue. Airlines have been reporting 1-6 billion in losses. Automakers have reported sales decline’s in the 30%. There’s a lot of fixed costs.Has that happened in any meaningful way with Apple?Not necessarily.  They could reduce costs to absorb.  Or sell cheaper models.  Or sell other services.Yeah how illogical to continually make exponential gains in the long run. What a bunch of idiots!Well this "liar" is making me a lot of fucking money, and his "lying" cars are flooding my city's streets and highways, and his "lying" solar roofs and batteries are invading all of my neighbor's rooftops and sidewalls.

There is still a year long wait for Model Y's and they have 600k+ preoddrs for cybertruck and an undisclosed number of reservations for the semi.[removed]Elaborate or are you another one of those clueless brainletts[removed]How much of TSLAs core sales come from preorders? Like I know Model 3 and Cybertruck have that element baked in. Given it’s basically a luxury good, it’s plausible the even mid pandemic sales may not drop off too far from deliverable cars.Amazon expanded into completely different services. AWS and all that.

Sure Tesla can expand the scope of their business, but it Amazons core business units were profitable before they dumped billions into AWS. Tesla can't even make money selling cars. Sure they make a shit load selling credits, but as more car makers start making EV's those gains will dieIt’s not my fault you don’t understand math.PETS.COM TO THE MOOOON.

“This time is different”Why would you ignore capex in a capital intensive business like the auto industry? Without capex the company doesn't maintain factories (let alone build new ones) and doesn't design new cars or spend on R&D. Do you think Tesla would be a viable business if they skipped out on all that?[deleted]no funds is going to buy tesla at these levels.. wtfThe SP 500 board doesn't have to include TSLA in because they profited every quarter.What will u buy at for the next ride to 2500Yeah seriously.

https://ycharts.com/companies/TSLA/revenues

For a capital intensive business like Tesla I'm generally more interested in annual or trailing 12 month revenues, but regardless do you even fact check yourself before you assert stuff like that?Because they're holding onto overvalued assets? Or because their undervalued assets never reach their true value?I think you're taking this a bit personally mate, no need for all the hostility. It wasn't a "gotcha" comment, it was just my opinion, which I happen to think conforms to the realities of the market. Tesla's a company with a great many fingers in a great many pies, I know that. They've got a competitive advantage in many areas, sure. That doesn't justify their price. 

The days of solid financials is certainly not "over". It'll never be "over", a firms value is fundamentally derived from its financials and when it stops being related to its value then you've either got an opportunity (if it's below) or a risk (if it's above). I think Tesla, at the minute, is much more the latter. I don't really care about whether my stock's going to the "moon" I care about whether it's going to crash if it gets there. The value of Tesla will be reevaluated at some point, when people get skittish enough for one reason or another. I'd rather not get caught out so i'll wait until the worry sets in and buy it on the other side.>The days of “solid financials” causing a stock to moon are over.

This is literally the defining characteristic of a speculative bubble - when asset prices become detached from reality.$6700 when?

Tesla would need to grow its revenues by three orders of magnitude for that valuation to make sense.Cathie Wood of ARK InvestHaha. Thanks. I'll be fine. Still have plenty of moneyThat's true, but i feel it still doesnt justify 1500. Its mostly just hype and that is what most growth stock is.The stock was $300 a few months ago though. Are you saying that up until a few months ago people weren’t aware of the battery tech storage and AI stuff? More likely this is a hype and short squeeze furled riseAt this point we’re using the term investor pretty loosely. Buying Tesla now is like buying into Bitcoin after 10k. No matter how high that building goes it’s being built with shaky materials and once it starts crumbling the whole thing is going to come crashing down.Castles in the skyThe problem is the car market is only so big and if they ever develop self driving cars, it will destroy the size of the market by putting idle cars to work. They are priced as if they will make half the cars in the world at a profit. They are still yet to make a profit in a year.

The thing that is most telling to me is that at this valuation, they can’t find a single institutional investor to raise cash from. Take a 5% dilution and wipe out your debt and give yourself tons of cash to work with. Yet nobody will take that deal, or they can’t offer that deal to anyone because the due diligence would expose their scams.And all this hype is just helping their case. Growth is typically constrained by cash and financing. Elon is the best hype man around and the story is playing out to investors and bond holders benefit so everyone is willing to throw cheap money at him with the expectation he’ll use the cash and flip it into something great. Tesla spikes on tons of rumors or ideas floated by Elon because tons of people are willing to give him capital to make it happen now vs. any other company that would have to fight for that money and decent chance it still fizzles out. Tesla is crushing it because all the future growth opportunities and intangibles are realizable much sooner and easier than anyone would have expected. Huge numbers to grow into now though.AI or grid level storage are great technologies but are only Tesla technologies. It is not going to create additional demand for 1m cars to be sold a year.https://electrek.co/2019/05/07/tesla-tsla-2-billion-fiat-chrysler-emission-standards/A little less but yes.yesThis was my concern. Are they selling them at cheaper price to ICE manufacturers in order to maintain the money needed to post a profit? That hurts them in the long run (if it was done for the goal of getting into S&P 500 and they end up not getting it).Favourable company car schemes, mostly... I won't actually be paying anything close to the list priceI don’t think batteries matter. They are comparable to gas cars in range now. There is just not the infrastructure for everyone to be driving electric cars all the time. Even Tesla’s own supercharging network had hours long lines in some places last Thanksgiving. Until I can literally not even think about charging on a road trip it is a deal breaker. Even in a car that requires premium fuel I don’t have to think about running out of gas out in rural areas.The issue is that Tesla is only cool because they are the only player in that game right now. Competition is on the way and Tesla will no longer be the cool new technology. 

On top of that, Tesla is a shit product compared to other cars in that price range. Horrible fit and finish, horrible customer service, bad reliability and warranty, less features than other vehicles at that price. They have torque because they are EVs and that’s how all of those work, but that advantage goes away very soon. Tesla does not have staying power currently. That’s just a reality.Auto company and free cash flow machine is an oxymoron. Tesla is a capital intensive business with low operating margins. Moreover, they produce cars with plenty of quality issues and have poor customer service.

Legacy automakers are making significant strides with regard to EVs and competition will ensure Tesla doesn’t earn high returns on capital.> They have 20% profit on a Model 3 or Y sale and have now ramped to mass production.

Could you show where in the 10Q and/or 10K one can see that Tesla has a 20% net operating profit after taxes?FYI, Tesla had over $6 Billion in Revenue this quarter. The $420 million credits were just a fraction of that.>I don’t know how you possibly spin this to a negative.

It's not negative per se, but it is risky, not sustainable. The market for emissions is artificial and can be revoked in one decisions. Which I personally think will happen sooner or later, because the planet doesn't care - CO2 emission is still CO2 emission.Growing revenue at 40-50% a year? Don't think so. 2019 showed only 14% revenue growth and it has been stagnating since then.That’s not PE’s doing. Any good operator would do that. Blame capitalism if you really want to cry about somethingPE?My company also reduced/rescinded bonuses. Most companies did.

Suppliers are treated this way all across the automotive industry. It sucks but it is almost industry standard practice at this point. 

Obviously both of these points are shitty things to do, but these aren't going to stand up as arguments for Tesla fudging their financials. 

Still an overvalued company if you ask me. I'm just not sure what will have to happen for it to come back down to reality.did you ever think that maybe with all their staff working from home that their accounting department might be running a bit behind?No that is not how this works. Musk's bonus increases the amount of cash Tesla gets.Actually... Can someone help me with this. GM and Ford, you almost buy and get the keys immediately right? How about Tesla. I heard you make the booking for a car a year in advance? If so, then their profit margin has more to do with sales last year? I could be wrong. Genuinely looking for some insights.Is it also possible to save up credits and book them as income now to get 4 profitable quarters? They have really sky-rocketed these last two quarters.Elon Musk learned from Matthew Lesko.Can't tell if you're talking about SPY or TSLA. Guess it doesnt matterIt isn't government money.

The bottle neck is batteries. Which Tesla is further ahead than their software lead on legacy auto.[deleted]Nah, Toyota is messing it up. Their $206B market cap is pretty gigantic.

I think TSLA is getting close to being more valuable than all non Toyota automakers combined though.Why stop there? TSLA to 51% of the entire stock marketDo to what reasoning? Against companies like uber witch will be dead in 4 years it looks pretty good.Based on what? Show me a competitor with a similar portfolio that is valued appropriately. Oh wait, there is no other company in the world like Tesla

Bring on the downvotes Tesla bears. It wont look as bad as your weekly puts.No I don't want get pedantic but I do want to find an accurate yardstick to measure Tesla against given it's huge potential for growth.Because FCA literally plans to sell more low emission vehicles, it's cheaper than paying the fines or handing Tesla a pile of money and doesn't have the same kind of dependence on another company.  FCA reported all this when it announced that headline $2B compliance credit spending number that gets thrown around all the time.  That was their allocated budget for 2019 to 2021 with the bulk of spending happening here in 2020 as they haven't ramped production of their lower emission vehicles yet but plan to by 2021 at which point spending on compliance credits will drop dramatically.This will be the thing that, in retrospect, looks so fucking obvious, but up till now has completely confused so many people, as well as investors.    


No, building an electric car is not easy.  Doing it at scale, profitably, is even harder.  TSLA longs have been hearing about the legacy Tesla killers for so long now that it's actually an amusing bear argument at this point.  I fully expect a couple legacy players will successfully move their business in this direction, but the blanket assumption that they were just going to step in and DOMINATE a new technology sector because "They really know how to build cars" is just a poor assumption not based in reality.Noone is expecting them not to take advantage of favorable regulation. All I am saying is that when you want to judge the strength of the actual underlying business operations you have to exclude income from credits as they arent actually income from operations. Plus as other manufacturers move towards EV's this income wont last. If in 3 years Tesla is still reliant on regulatory credits to cover operating losses that would be terrible. 

The operations themselves need to be profitable net of any extra income. Esp. as scale increases and R&D expenses are spread across an ever bigger base of cars. And hell given Teslas valuation they need to be as profitable as Apple's iphone.If you actually listened to the warnings call you would know that they are running low on credits and will not be able to make .5B next quarter selling them. 

If they sell the exact same number of vehicles and drop their credit sales by 25% they are even. 

If the car sales continue to decline like that have been in the earnings report tsla will be red next quarter. 

Fact is Tesla has had 10 years to fix their issues but they have not been able to. The only superficial argument is trying to defend a bad business model. 

When the market floods with EV what happens to Tesla then? Any type of competition will hurt their sales significantly. 

A different perspective. If I told you that my 10 year old business was worth 300k but only generates 100$ in 3 months, what would you say about my business?So when governments see a bunch of people with Teslas and other car companies following suit - what reason do they have to keep subsidizing Tesla?Because the bears need to justify their position.There are many points to Tesla as a business,  but the car business is about selling sexy cars and tech. I don’t honestly think they’re that bothered about emissions.The auto industry isn't about what's cheaper, it's about keeping up the sale of parts for internal combustion engines. That's their big money maker.Your link "California woman allegedly pees on floor of Verizon store after being asked to wear a mask">For now I guess their strategy is to pay Tesla to compensate for being so far behind in technology.

I'm pretty sure they're not selling EVs because it's a money-losing proposition at this point.Ok. Did you know we benefit from Zev credits if the companies pay the state instead of Tesla?Clearly you didn't understand my responseI’m saying incentivizing creating more electric vehicles is a good thing, but tesla beat earnings based on the sale of their excess credits that were granted by the govt. 

I would think the logical course of action would be for the government to impose a carbon tax rather than allow companies to buy credits from tesla to be able to meet regulations.

I am genuinely confused about the reasoning for the ability to sell and profit from excess regulatory credits. I’m not confused by the reason that these credits exist

(Should have explained my thinking better in the first comment)I don’t really understand what you’re trying to say by “gas carmakers don’t pay for their externalities” but i’ll assume you’re trying to say they do not have to pay for producing gas powered vehicles.

They do in fact have to buy credits from  companies like tesla who have excess regulatory credits. So while they aren’t paying the gov’t, they end up paying tesla which resulted in tesla beating earnings by a great dealWell aware. Whether FC has acually paid them these sums is another story.No major country is going to completely ban gasoline and diesel vehicles within the next 10-20 years. Maybe some particularly progressive locales will implement a ban or restriction on new non-commercial vehicles, but we’re a long way from blanket bans being anywhere near feasible. Also, even if that were to occur Tesla doesn’t have the ability to fill all of that space, their manufacturing capacity isn’t even close to large enough.

The bottom line with regulatory credits is that they aren’t certain, and as other manufacturers sprint to compete in the EV market they will dwindle and then disappear entirely. They aren’t a solution to Tesla’s problems, they’re just one more short term stop gap. The fundamental problems that Tesla is facing still exist. 

Also just to be clear, I have no monetary ties to Tesla and I couldn’t care less if it goes up, down, or in loop-de-loops.Because you're not investing profits if you're also losing money. But yes, that was their idea last year when they went 2 quarters without losing money.

At any time Amazon could have just turned on the profits instead of re-investing. Tesla isn't quite at that point.>edit: so on r/investing. If the answer to your question is "no" people just downvote you?

They don't need the money.Oh, so just issuing shares?Financing with debt aka issuing bonds or taking a loan from a financial institution generally is more efficient from a tax and cost of capital standpoint. Cost of capital is essentially how much it costs to raise money. Two major ways a company can raise money, issue stock or equity or issue debt. Generally equity has a higher cost of capital as you are essentially selling a part of your business, this representing both present and future cash flows and earnings. In turn however, this also means that there are very loose obligations to equity holders (no need to pay dividends, etc.) Debt has a lower cost of capital due to the general fixed nature of payments/cost, but comes with setbacks such as required periodic payments (think interest payments) that must be met otherwise there are repercussions. In addition to this, any payments made to service debt is tax deductible and is generally not included in taxable income for a corporation. Does this help?What a weird argument. “They spend all their money in smart things so they have less purchasing power”. 

So you’re effectively saying they have more purchasing power, they just spend it more wisely.What are you even going on about? Americans own real estate as well. It’s part of the “American dream” handbook.[removed]Using GDP here is super flawed. Firstly in both countries, the wealth is concentrated at the top so just using an average value is extremely skewed. The wealth of the Chinese white collar workers has increased exponentially over the years. I would say their spending power is somewhat comparable to Americans in the same demographic. And the cherry on the cake is China has many more people like that, than America does. There's a reason every American MNC considers China their biggest market outside of the US. So to imply that Chinese don't have spending power is naiveI agree with your points, but it's not like the EY audits were in some third world country or something. It's a German company they audited.I would disagree with saying there are “plenty of examples” of material misstatements missed by auditors... let alone fraud as insinuated by the OP.

Examples such as Wirecard are rare one-offs, and OP is not insinuating overstated cash balances as in Wirecard, but revenue overstatement... good luck with that.Bud, this is exactly the reason why I am so bullish. Show me one other CEO that doesn't give a rat's left ass-cheek about the SEC or stock prices.

It's these ironic reasons that I am so bullish. Think about all of the new money pouring in right now. Bunch of youngsters who hate authority and love rebels, ESPECIALLY companies that are rebels themselves. Elon's a fucking meme, in a good way, and so is his whole fucking company. 

The fact that Elon and Tesla are a meme that stand for "bettering the entire planet through EVs, improving mankind, synchronizing with AI, and getting to Human 2.0" is the exact fucking reason WHY IT WILL WORK.

I can't wait to upload a THINK to the internet and for you to understand everything I mean in a matter of milliseconds. And yes, I called it a Think. Trademarked, bitch.I mean, that's the whole intent of the tax credits system.

Sorry for your losses, though.Sorry. There are no serious auditorsYesInvestors have historically provided capital, yes. And the appetite for shares supports the notion that shareholders are willing to provide more capital in the future, either in a new share class or a secondary dilutive offering. I'm not saying that current investors are funding expansions lol.

Creditors as in loans, yes. Tesla could probably afford more debt based on its current balance sheet, but probably shouldn't, IMO. But it could is the point. 

I'm not sure what you mean, margins, even at break even support the ongoing operations, and the rest of cash is used for giga construction, other capex, and debt service. As economy recovers, demand and sales will increase at least in line with the economy, but based on Q2 performance compared to peers (Tesla flat, peers down 25% or more) Tesla will see higher sales increase than the economy as a whole. 

That in itself is not a road to a 1600 valuation, but the company isn't going to die, and it will essily afford to build gigas.Discounts on a producer “direct-to” consumer products don’t mean as much. Especially when the cost to produce said product is drastically decreasing. You underestimaate his ability to slash profit for market share, even as he makes profit. Hold bags bitch.I'm not a Tesla fanboy at all and I think anyone investing in it is out of their damn mind, but if they came up with no hands, no attention self driving, I would buy one tomorrowIn Europe they are still more expensive than the comparable competition.

It's basically a startup. On an operating basis, volume will eventually high enough to absorb the initial capex, and that is what Tesla is positioning for - an all electric road.

It's a bad assumption that factory maintenance would be the same cost level as initial construction of a factory. If they stopped expanding factories, you'd see a dramatic reduction in capex spend, and Tesla would be settling to be in the long term what it is now - a niche automaker. For now it's not an apples to apples comparison to say that building a new factory is an appropriate amount of capex to weight against operational cash flow. 

Your point about cutting off r&d and capex is separate from evaluating operations because r&d and capex on new buildings is based on growth. Growth is funded by investors and creditors, of which there is no shortage in this market for a company like Tesla. 

The price of the stock is an entirely new conversation, and it's an exhausting one. Everyone knows the price totally out of whack based on Tesla as a pure automaker, and nobody argues that. But the game changes dramatically with new battery tech and if self driving comes into play. Those are big it's, and if you don't believe them don't buy the stock. But on the "loses money on production" that's observabley not true. They don't make big fat margins yet, but the current busienss model ekes out small gains based on a growing segment.that's a yikes from me dawg, i'm outta this convo

hopefully you don't take it too harsh to heart in 5 years when you'll be kicking yourself every morning when you wake up and remember how stupid and naive you were to not do your own research. it's scrumptiously ironic how the same people who yell "fake news" about anything that doesn't match their perspective are the ones being reamed in the ass by some podcast that's screaming "OIL ISNT GOING ANYWHERE, SOLAR ISNT SUSTAINABLE, DID YOU KNOW ELECTRICITY IS MADE FROM COAL???? TOYOTA MAKES 10M CARS TESLA MAKES 100K!"

Top fucking humor, IMO.I will sell some at 2000 and will hold some for 2500.But Reddit is Reddit, so I expect it to not beWhat about my anus?Why wouldn't they matter? If anything, going over $1000 spurred more covering as brokers realized that maybe their retail clients don't have the finances to cover Tesla at, say, $1100 or $1200 when they did have the cover at $500 or $600. Now extend that same logic to $1500 and $1600 for the people who shorted it at $1000. Tesla is by far the most shorted company on Wall Street ao idk how that it could be possible with the recent price action that short covers wouldn't matter.I get it, my point is that it already takes shocksThis is the way lol i started with 700 at the mid-end of June. It’s at 2900 now. It’s addictive watching your money grow and accumulate. 

I’m selling shit i don’t need, and just dumping my disposable income that i would have otherwise blown.

This portfolio is getting me a house 😤Right on!  This is America, GD right...Hey I'm a newbie to partial shares, once they add up to 1.00 do you have a real while share like can you sell it off as one or move it to another broker, or is it in bit, really appreciate if someone could shed some light on building up partialsnah i just follow what other people hype up on WSB.

 On the other hand, Amazon is primarily a cloud based computing company coupled to a fulfillment comlany, not a heavily R&D focused car company, so this may turn out differently.Woah there guy getting a little uppity over a honest mistake on my part I was looking at auto revenue and misread the chart. Looking at the actual numbers it seems there was about a 1% growth from Q4 18 to Q4 19 in auto revenue which is pretty flat in my book for a growth company.It goes multiple ways. Every company has to eventually have the fundamentals to justify its valuation eventually or the price will correct. The market is willing to give a long leash to ideas it thinks may work and a shorter leash to what it is more skeptical about, and stuff like calls and puts aren't just making a valuation judgement, they are making a timing judgement that is a lot less evidence based

Tesla may eventually grow into its valuation and prove itself on fundementals, it might not, but the market still has a lot of leash for ElonTulip bulb mania all over again. People who have never done a DCF or NPV model just use the words priced in and future looking to justify the price instead of the underlying business. I love how you never said Tesla was a bad company but he attacked you for not buying stock as if you said it was a bad company.By the end of 2024

They reviewed 10 different scenarios, and all of them basically pointed to over 7k.

Three big markers:

- gross margins
- capital efficiency 
- autonomous capability

Battery costs are 3-4 years ahead of any auto manufacturer in terms of cost to clients.

So even Daimler and BMW will basically have to sell their electrics at a loss for them to do any damage in the market.

Only auto manufacturer to have AI chips.
So they’re way ahead on autonomous.How long can you hold the puts for?But that's the technical side. Insanely over priced. Lots of shorts. And index funds that will have to buy. it's more of a perfect storm than a long term investment thesis.

But then again...a lot of towns use most recent sale price to evaluate taxes since the sale price is the most accurate indicator of the value.If no one drives anymore in 15 years and 80% drive self driving Tesla's, this price will be low.it is good to note that ground transportation is a 5 trillion industry. And Tesla is currently the lead in the event of electrification.

Tesla is also more then just ground transportation, reiterated during the quarterly, Tesla expects Tesla Energy to be equal or greater then its automotive business.> but i feel it still doesnt justify 1500.

Tesla has a new battery technology coming out that will allow them to get 100,000 miles on a single charge that takes 3 minutes. Also it will provide unlimited grid storage for solar, and costs 1/3 as much as batteries today cost.

Is that true? I don't know. But it could be someday. That's why TSLA is 1500.Yeah that's what I meant by technicals and investor sentiment...

None of those long term things could happen if Tesla folded as a car company. So now that it looks like their cash flow is healthy those other projects have a higher probability of happening.They had institutional buyers in February... 
They made a profit last year...
If you haven't figured out what mobility as a service is worth, hop in your Uber to Wall Street where funds are praying TSLA offers more shares for them to buy into their indexes.[deleted]Actually nowhere near. If 2020 ends up double 2019 (as Zach said on the call), there's about 400m remaining for H2 2020. They sold 428m in Q2 alone. That's 228m less next quarter. That would swing them from a profit of 100m to a loss of 128m.Actually no. 

If 2020 ends up double 2019 (as Zach said on the call), there's about 400m remaining for H2 2020. They sold 428m in Q2 alone. That means 228m less next quarter. That would swing them from a profit of 100m to a loss of 128m.RemindMe! 3 MonthsBut credits!!!! Stock only go UPNew tech will always be a bumpy road, but Tesla is investing massively in infrastructure, no one else has proprietary chargers, which along with the cars are charging faster.

It wouldn’t be feasible for every car on the road today to be electric tomorrow, but as more people make the switch to EV, in a few years I think a major buying decision will be who has the better charging network, and other automakers are not going to want to start their own proprietary systems when they can use existing.The same could have been said about gasoline when horse feed was ubiquitous, this infrastructure takes time.> The issue is that Tesla is only cool because they are the only player in that game right now. Competition is on the way and Tesla will no longer be the cool new technology. 

In fact competition is here and is obliterating Tesla's sales in Europe.Dude, the Tesla models have like 30%+ gross profit margin on them.

The R&D for new technology is expensive, the barrier to entry in the EV market is expensive, it took Tesla over a decade of losses to get to where they are today. The legacy automakers won't catch up to them overnight, they have years of expensive R&D to even match what Tesla has today.

Also the 'lead' the legacy auto-makers have Tesla today in market share is meaningless. Nokia had a virtual lockdown on the entire cell phone market when Apple came along with the iPhone. 9 of the top 10 best selling phone models were literally made by Nokia. Yet Nokia's utterly dominant market share completely fell apart when they utterly failed to adapt to the shift to smartphones. Multiple auto-makers are going to meet the same fate with the shift to EV's.Omg you just used the competition is coming line 🤣. Please tell me who is taking market share anytime soon. 

You also ignored the 20% margin piece. You’re hopeless.They have a 25.4% margin on auto sales right in the 2Q update they just released...You believe that emissions tax will just magically go away? Aren't we seeing more and more impacts from climate change to such a tune that mass polluters are starting to try to do a hard turn.

China is trying its damnest to do the EV game too, but Tesla is still winning (for now). Pretty sure many countries WANT to be cleaner, but the cost is just too high right now. Tesla is helping bring those costs down.The chinese factory and market might also be risky especially with the us china tensions right nowIt's a small percentage of the revenue, I can see being upset that the numbers are being used to show a profit, but it hardly keeps the company alive.“Slowed down since then.” Oh you mean in 1H 2020? With a global pandemic shutting down factories and supply chains? When you’re throwing out earnings for every other company. Ok bud.Seriously, what on earth would PE have to do with normal cash flow optimization?100% PE. Private equity in it's earliest form was pulling the Gordon Gecko and evolved to todays form of load debt and strip cash flows for maximum valuation.  2008 c suite execs started to look to keep cash because of the economy, so they took a page from PE and started stretching payables bc they could get sympathy from the suppliers at the time.Private equityDont think that's a good excuse for a quarterly report.They didn't write that in the letter.Weird how no other large profitable company seems to consistently have this issue.What the fuck, did i just readAre you serious? Lollmfaowhatever you make by fomoing into this trash you will lose down the line with this sort of intelligence

they have 8.6 billion😂😂😂 ...And where does this free money come from?Tesla you place a $100 deposit, and with a M3 you will probably get it by end of that same quarter. Y is still backlogged. S and X you can get in a few weeks. And you pay when you get the car, sales are recorded exactly the same.The wait for a Tesla is just a few weeks now.

Also: The profit is registered only when the car is physically delivered to the customer.That's exactly what they did. Zach mentioned on the call that they'd be selling significantly fewer credits for the rest of the year.Aren't you kinda contradicting yourself?

"There are a lot of reason while tesla shouldn't valued as a typical car maker"

Proceeds to compare them to carmakers?

If Tesla succeed in making FSD, Tesla should be the most valuable company in the world.

Self driving cars are multitrillion market.

Inb4 people talk about WayMo and other FSD companies: I'm not saying Tesla will be the company to make FSD, but according to the stock market, they are, to a lot of people.Tesla is already $370B now since the share count is way higher now with the release of the latest financials.I feel like you’re not being ambitious enough. TSLA to 50% of world GDP by 2030.Who need the S&P500 when TSLA hits 20,000/share and surpasses it anywayAll I’m saying is that they are pricing in like 5 years of r and d, and sales. Bless you if you made money on the come up but I can’t touch it at these levelsWaymo, FCA, Volvo. All bringing similar things to the tableBased on every metric used to derive valuation.  

Why do Tesla fanboys get so defensive?  It’s like you hate having the light shined on the company because you’re afraid that the world will realize your riding a hype-bubble.  Papa Elon is no different.  The only CEOs I’ve seen who hate and publicly target short-sellers as much as him are all at head of scams and pyramids.  They shouldn’t be afraid of the market correcting itself if they’re is tangible basis for valuations.‘iTs A tECh cOmPaNy nOt aN aUtO cOmPaNy’ is not really the best phrase to use when searching for an ‘accurate yardstick’.  

Mainly because first and foremost, the tech companies you want to compare Tesla against are profitable.  If Tesla wasn’t cashing emissions credits, it wouldn’t be.  Secondly, if you look at the earnings multiples, revenue multiples or even sales multiples that tech companies are regularly valued at , you’ll find that Tesla has already radically overshot those as well.Ok, but my point is that people will have to buy them. They need to be compelling products. You believe they will materialize out of nowhere? Developing a car in these companies takes at least 5 years. They knew about the regulations in time. Why are they even in the position now to pay Tesla so much money? I believe they will make a new deal with Tesla. Probably for less money but still.I can see Toyota and the European car companies pulling off the move, but I agree. Nothing that’s happened in the past decade has convinced me that Ford and GM aren’t total fossils.I dunno.

I fully expect European and especially Asian automakers to flip the switch soon and give Tesla a run for its money. 

Many Asian companies have a good natural understanding that first and foremost they're manufacturers. That is their core business. That's why you can buy respectable dirt bikes, guitars and pianos from Yamaha, and why Hyundai and Samsung are huge shipbuilders. Precisely because they can smell a dollar and do a good job of retooling and expanding and R&D.

The American legacy makers have had it too easy and forget this, but they already see the writing on the wall and have a lot of resources to show up for the competition. Once staring down the barrel they have no choice. 

That's not to say that Tesla won't steal the crown, but there's no way they'll be alone.Building an electric car is easy. They're just bigger golf-carts, with scaled up batteries. A hundred years ago most cars were electric. 

GM restarted the electric car revolution when they introduced the EV1 in the 90's. I've been following the market since then, including when Musk developed the roadster. But really Toyota Prius really kick-started the market for electric drive trains.

TSLA is just currently taking advantage of the market vacuum in electric cars that exist. Most cars & trucks by 2030 will be electric again, especially with a Democratic administration coming up.You say this as if they are only subsidizing Tesla. This is not the case, this is a consequence of carbon pricing. All auto manufacturers are charged a certain penalty per car due to the environmental impact of said car, but Tesla is racking up these credits due to the fact that their cars are electric, and thus get credits on these penalties, and are able to sell their carbon allocations to other manufacturers who stand to benefit by purchasing them. If other auto makers also go electric, they too will receive credits.If you believe this, you have not studied their business model sufficiently enough. From day one, Tesla says their "mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy". This is clearly defined as their primary target, and those things you mention are secondary effects to increase the rate of adoption. Given that you believe this, and they are meeting, and occasionally beating, metrics, I would say that they are successful on both fronts.Business is about making money.  If FCA thought they could launch a competitive EV program that would keep them from getting fined for less than what they're paying Tesla, that's what they would do.   At least for the near term, regulatory credit sales are going to be a viable business for Tesla.  Some people see this as a negative, whereas I see it as a validation of how far ahead they are.  Their "competitors" are currently paying them instead of competing with them.  I like that market position.Sounds like a typical earnings call with Musk, if you ask me.Lol. I'll leave that in and edit with the link I meant.Would be funny if, "Woman turns out to be Elon Musk, because he just doesn't care anymore."About the same level of DD we're all used to on this sub> I'm pretty sure they're not selling EVs because it's a money-losing proposition at this point.

You say, on a thread about a 100% EV company posting it's 4th straight quarter of profits.So the strategy is to wait as Tesla corners the market. Hmmm...

Why don't they just make EVs that are profitable like Tesla does? Have they tried that?It's supposed to be an economic incentive to change, not just a tax on the entire industry.RemindMe! 20hours I'm interested on what people have to say on thisI'd imagine the revenue would still be recognized on the income statement. If the cash wasn't paid, wouldn't an associated accounts receivable asset would be created?They are doing 25% margin on every vehicle and investing $350m per quarter in R&D, and their assets are growing like ~$2B a quarter to $38B now. 

But regulatory credits... lolBut he looks like tony starkNo competition in sight?

Damn til tesla is the only car maker

How about toyota, tesla has more value and what percent of the rev and earnings of toyota??You think all those companies needed was a vision?  I can't say I agree.Its 400m of credits

Their car making isn't profitableARKG is my favorite ETF, and it has done well enough without Tesla.You can differentiate share classes (e.g. class A and class B shares)Somewhat yes, but in layman terms, what does this mean for the likes of investors?It also assumes real estate is the “smart thing.”

The weirdest part is saying “if you know Chinese culture” in some sort of weird flex. I have a multi-entry visa into China because I go for work, the gargantuan empty apartment buildings definitely are not “smart investments.”More like "they have equal purchasing power (US still has a bit more overall) but the Chinese tie it up in home assets so they actually have less purchasing power overall- less influence over the market directly because they cannot spend it freely".Yeah you mortgage ONE home over your lifetime. Many Chinese would prefer to put money into real estate vs stocks. This means amassing an empire of tangible property. This could be a cultural perception shifting over time, but the way the wealthy still eat up real estate overseas doesn't seem to be indicating that much.Your submission has been automatically removed because the URL matches one on the /r/Investing banlist due to low quality content.

That’s why we have “disposable income by capita”.

But that’s what my American education taught me...It's a German company they audit that was able to perpetrate fraud due to relaxed banking standards overseas. It's apples and oranges.The silver plated gold bars, all the stuff in China going on, Celadon, Valeant, 1MDB, Tesco, AIG, wells fargo..it isn't common but it's not that rare. Those are only the big ones. Revenue recognition fraud is a very common fraud. And at it's heart, wirecard was revenue recognition fraud. They said they had millions in revenue they didn't and shuffled the fake revenue into cash accounts. The fake cash accounts were fake because the revenue didn't exist. 
You can read all the accounting and auditing enforcement on the SEC website, Novartis just had one 

https://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/friactions.shtmlI'd say every company I followed that went from small to big was not interested in their stock price or profits overly much. They were interested in delighting customers consistently.Wtf does this meanPublic companies listed on the nasdaq have to get audited by a third party> but the company isn't going to die

I agree. As much as I sound like a sore bear, I'm not. I'm an avid follower of e-mobility and has background in transportation sector. 

I wish Elon to succeed in his goal of dragging ICE car makers to e-mobility era. By the look if it, he is succeeding. 

One thing is for sure, the climate change impact of automobiles cannot be minimized without mass market car. Which Chinese and Europeans are doing more than Mr. Musk.

I think diesel-gate is a blessing in disguise, because it forced VW group to pivot towards electrification of their fleet.To be clear, I’m not rooting against Tesla. I’m simply pointing out they have been discounting their products. They also recently discounted solar come to think of it.Oh really? By what metrics. Because they continue to print moneyHow did your short sale go today?Been hearing that since I bought my first shares at around 200Musk hasn't shown that he does anything strictly for profit. I don't know where you ever got such an idea.Yes. I’m about to sell 20 Shares to get some of my own. Also bought my model 3 with my profits in August last year. Letting the rest of my 180 shares ride. Don’t understand why people keep betting against this stock.No, he sets very aggressive goals and does not always deliver on time. But he usually delivers. Being mistaken about something is not the same as lying.Same here. Its actually hard to buy TSLA when you own a Tesla...You missed out>It's basically a startup.

A $300 billion company with $20 billion in annual revenue and 50,000 employees worldwide? Nah. Granted, the definition of "startup" is subjective, but having expectations of high growth in the future does not mean a company is a startup. And aside from all that, growth has been moderate over the past 8 quarters or so.

>Your point about cutting off r&d and capex is separate from evaluating operations because r&d and capex on new buildings is based on growth.

That's simply not true. Even slow-growing, mature incumbents in this industry have huge capex costs. Per the most recent info I could find (2017), Toyota and GM had about $50 billion in capex combined and how fast do you think they're growing? Even Ford had $6 billion that year, and Tesla is on track for about $2 billion this year. 

>But on the "loses money on production" that's observabley not true.

I don't know what to tell you then, look at the income statement and subtract $428 million from the revenue section, then let me know what you come up with. It will be negative.

Other items of note are that energy generation and storage (often cited as the businesses which make Tesla *not just a car company*) account for <10% of revenue and aren't growing much.[deleted]Ohh ok i get it now.

Did that help you understand?Puts and calls and digeridoos are not investing they are trading. There is a difference.One of us!I thought I was on WSB until I read this comment.If you actually went through with it you would have made millions with Tesla.The more you learn about other avenues of investing in the stock market, the more you realize you should have just stuck with index funds all along.How old are you? And how risky are you? If you're young and want to somewhat YOLO, growth ETFs. Growth companies are companies that can 10x your investment in the long run. Problem is they are the most likely to fail hahaTrue, but do you see Tesla outgunning and outspending (R&D) Ford, GM, Toyota, Honda?  It's like Ford vs Ferrari.  Ferrari had the far superior cars, but they were boutique.  Ford blew A LOT of money to catch up, but then just left them behind.  I love Tesla, I own shares, would like to own a car, but their balance sheet and income statement does not make them the highest valued auto mfg in the world, by a long shot.  

Amazon is a different beast.  Tesla could get there, but manufacturing is much more cost prohibitive (tighter margins) than service.Appreciate you admitting the mistake, and apologies if I was uppity.    


With respect to your broader observation about the small actual difference, I would point out that for a growth company operating in an industry such as automotive, I think longer timeframes are the better point of reference.  In Q4 18 Tesla pulled forward a huge amount of demand due to the expiration of the full EV tax credit, so the fact that they were able to match it a year later when said credit was 25% of a year prior, I still view as impressive.    


The 3 year running trend for revenue is $11.759B in 17, to $21.461B to $24.578B.  I would personally classify that as a growth company.I thought that was what you were saying,  wasnt immediately sure if you were arguing for or against my point.

I hope Tesla does work out, but the current proce is... ridiculousPeople tend to get sensitive when you question their hype. I remember a lot of similar sentiment around bitcoin. Personally, I like to invest my money in companies which are great now with good prospects, i'm not in the business of fortune telling.Price is high then, got it.That's a long time for Ford, GM, Fiat, Mercedes, BMW, VW, Toyota and Honda to catch up. Which they're obviously planning on doing and at least some will succeed at. 

Even if Tesla is here to stay and some majors spiral downward, it's basically impossible that they'd all fold while Tesla remains high. There's only so much room to grow in market cap for what they have on offer and compared to the others it simply doesn't make sense. 

Now, it might make sense since markets are irrational, but honestly I think the best deals will be Ford and Toyota and the like. Even if Tesla blows them out of the water on innovation and market share, they're not going to choose to not compete.That seems incredibly aggressive even at 25 years like I don't know that new drivers and vehicle turnover would be enough to account for that in 15 years.> esla expects Tesla Energy to be equal or greater then its automotive business.

Tesla has been saying that for years and their growth has been pennies on the dollars promised.“Could this penny stock eventually solve every problem in the world? Is that true? I don’t know. But it could be someday.” 

This robinhood investing logic is what got is here in the first place.I dont think their AI and battery tech justify 300B market cap. If its for future potential, i dont think it would happen within 5-10 years to justify the 300B or even 150B and by that time you might say its worth 500B+ because of future growthYes because subsidizing a ubiquitously used product with VC capital to gain market share while operating unprofitably is a great long term strategy that works out all the time. Uber is never going to be able to compete on cost profitably because Sergei in a garage in queens dispatching on a flip phone is always going to have a lower cost basis than a company with numerous developers, lawyers, an advertising budget and a fancy office in San Francisco. Time will tell if they can charge enough for the convenience of their service to get people to pay for it at a level that sustains profit. I suspect that if taxi commissions developed hailing apps and convenient payment methods, the answer would be no.math at its finest lol40K cars x 10$/car = 400 K$

40K cars x 10,000$/car = 400,000 K$

400,000 K$ == 400 M$10k x 40k = 400m lolWow... The deep stupiditySo call FCA up and tell them they overpaid by a couple orders of magnitude lol. You can quibble about whether you think it's a fair transaction or not, but that's how this works.

|-|-|-|-|Damn... I have never thought about the Nokia:Apple::Legacy:Tesla before. EVs are the "next thing". Younger generations drool over Tesla the way we drooled over Apple. Haters gonna hate, but tides are shifting.Their operating margin this quarter was 5.4%. That’s tiny, and it’s inflated due to regulatory credits. Their gross margin is inflated as well. 

As for competition, there’s plenty, and the cars will almost certainly be of higher quality than Tesla’s cars. To name a few: the Nissan Ariya, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Audi e-tron, Volkswagen e-Golf, and Porsche Taycan. Tesla has already lost market share in Europe.I'm not asking about figures from press releases. I'm asking about the quarterly and annual reports they file with the SEC. [Here's the prior quarter's filing](https://ir.tesla.com/static-files/bbc6e137-897a-4543-857a-59c5c2dbeadc). Please show me where I can find that Tesla reported a 20% net operating profit after taxes.Not the emission tax itself, but the emission market. If we want to save the planet, then all automakers need to abide by the same rules. The way it is now is that for example Ford can sell tons of gas guzzling pickup trucks at hefty margins and just buy emission credits from Tesla while still making profit.Doesn't alter the fact they have stagnating revenue for 5-6 quarters. So be careful comparing them to Amazon: https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/revenueYeah lol fuck anyone who tries to shrink their working capitalLoads of big profitable companies have this issue, the bigger the company the closer I look at accounting before I extend credit. Too many people extend credit based on name instead of history and get burned.A combination of Elon and the shareholders of Tesla.

You could look this up yourself or if you lose the obnoxious attitude i could explain it to you.I see. So basically other than sales for Y, this Quarter accounts for sales, deliveries and revenue recognition for M3, S and X

Thanks friend!So how many credits do they have? 
Why isnt the credits on the balance sheet. 

Also when are credits given ? On delivery or when you sell the car. 

Are they selling credits they don't have from pre-orders ?They will have approximately $200M per quarter in each Q3 and Q4 to claim based on Zach’s statements.yes, but that only leaves $164B to spare, which means Honda (47B), Ferrari (34B), GM (37B), Ford (27B), Daimler (48B), Toyota 206B are enough to surpass TSLA. 

VW is also a huge brand but they aren't listed in the US.That's nothing. Tesla already has a car delivered in space. We need to talk in GDP of the entire universe.Who builds waymo cars and batteries? Who has a better ability to scale a mass ride-sharing fleet? Same question for Volvo. FCA and Tesla actually work together quite a bit. 

Vertical integration across multiple product lines is the key to Tesla success.They can just do what Nissan did with the Leaf before the federal credits ran out: sell them to their dealerships so the dealers can collect the federal money and then the dealers can turn around and sell them as "used" cars with 10 miles on them for a slight markup over the invoice minus credits value which makes them just cheap enough that people will consider buying them. Everyone wins but the taxpayer.Well these penalties requiring the fleet averages didn't materialize out of nowhere either, for the most part manufacturers are in compliance or near enough to it to pay a much less substantial fine on their fleets.  FCA is really lone outlier here with being this far behind.  It's not impossible that they don't meet their goals but even if they're only marginally successful they'll both be buying a lower volume of credits and also have a wider pool of companies to deal with that would substantially dampen the demand for Tesla's credits.Personally I actually think VW is in a decent spot, BMW and Merc less so. Toyota and Honda are behind imo, they bet on fuel cells and haven't been quick to pivot. Hyundai and Kia, imo, are doing very well, and given the fact that Korea has a lot of battery suppliers, I expect they're going to grow their market share in the next decade.

As for America, yeah I'd say none are doing great. People pretend like the legacy auto companies can pivot like a startup, and that's just not how giant multinational goliaths behave. More will die than make it.The thing is I really believe people underestimate how easy "flipping the switch" is. Flipping the switch in this context means changing the primary thing you do as a business (build engines) while also replacing profitable lineups of vehicles with zero or negative margin products. In the best case scenario that will be a tight rope.

If it were easy, I think we'd have stronger competition already, or at a bare minimum in the pipeline. To me it seems like most car companies are building a few low volume electric vehicles to satisfy investors and get themselves into the conversation, but they are far from flipping any switches.

I don't expect Tesla to take all the marbles for what it's worth, I think they'll carve out a very similar niche in the market long term as Apple (I'm not super bullish on fsd in the next five years, so if I'm wrong this could change). What I mean by that is minority market share (tho respectable) but most of the mind share and profits.A long range EV today has 50-100 kwh worth of batteries.  In the best case scenario you're talking $5,000-$15,000 worth of cells, and a few thousand more on top of that worth of battery pack overhead construction.  You characterize that entire reality as "scaled up batteries in big golf carts" which tells me you have zero understanding of how this market operates.You make it sound so easy, yet nobody can match Tesla on all specs. Sure, one might have the same range, but price and 0-60 are worse. One might be as quick, but again, can't match range or price.

Tesla would exist without the Prius, but other automakers would not be this far along without Tesla.

Automakers can't match an 8yo Tesla, and the gap is going to get worse. Tesla is going to be automotive king when electric is mainstream.> A hundred years ago most cars were electric. 

Not even a little bit.

> In the United States by the turn of the century, 40 percent of automobiles were powered by steam, 38 percent by electricity, and 22 percent by gasoline. By 1912, an electric car sold for almost **double the price** of a gasoline car. Most electric car makers **stopped production at some point in the 1910s.**Thanks for the informative reply, I did not know that. So these credits are essentially compensation for environmental damage penalties levied against all manufacturers? Sounds much more stable long-term than I was thinking, as well as making it much more sensible to disregard their effect on the bottom line.Also any manufacturer that had aspirations of ramping up their EV offerings over the next couple years got a wet rag thrown on those plans by covid, so the credit sales aren't going to dry up particularly quickly either.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdote

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-mover_advantage

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demandTesla doesn't make them profitably either.Yet tesla is the only one getting the benefitsEVs

But here is the competition you're referring to:

https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/huyibu/ytd_us_auto_sales_tesla_is_the_only_one_with_yoy/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=shareThat is to keep their construction industry going. What I am saying is Chinese people prefer to invest their money into housing. They will buy in areas they grew up in or their family resides. Sometimes they purchase from those giant empty buildings, but rarely to live in. More as another investment.

It isn't a weird flex so much as clarifying for someone that you have insight into the culture.Read the contextYesTesla is fascinating, I don't know who wouldn't be interested to follow it. I agree they have played and will continue to play a big role in forcing the industry's hand towards electric. They've also objectively engineered an incredible machine. If you haven't driven one, test drive one, it's super cool. I don't own one, but the drive is very powerful and comfortable. 

As far as mass market Tesla has disappointed. The model 3 was supposed to be the one, like Neo. It's more like a BMW 3 series at a discounted price. It's hardly for the every man. Tons of cheaper electric alternatives are available, but they all suck so far. None of the style, a fraction of the range, power doesn't compare, charging networks pale. It's still an open race for the mass market, but Tesla still has a lead (somehow).

The model y is in good market position to take more share of a huge luxury crossover market. 

What do you think about the self driving race?True. I’m excited and on reddit /: but I wanna point out one more thing. Biden and the dems, LOVE ev and solar energy. It’s only gonna get cheaper.Apple hasn't grown materially in 5 years. Excluding the Trump tax cuts profits are down. 88% of EPS growth has been from share buybacks. Margins continue to decline. Etc. Stock price has tripled.I'm not that dumb to short it. The irrationality with Tesla is stronger than The Force.So you bought this year?gamblers never retire for a reasonAugust last year? When did you initially buy the shares?SolarCity is just a bunch of salesmen and the solar tiles are not so real.He’s “really smart” and knows the goals he presents are unattainable.  The unwashed masses, however, are usually not smart enough to understand that.Look I'm not trying to convince you to buy Tesla or even to like it. But your bias against the valuation and unwillingness to treat it like what it is are coloring your analysis. 

Capex - Toyota and Ford are capexing out the ass explicitly to design cars and factories that can become what Tesla already is, not to maintain what they have. 

Startup status - when Tesla sold the roadster and the S, it was not the same kind of company it is now. Then it was not "serious", it was a billionaire designing a cool toy. Now it has used the success of that endeavor to reboot and is starting again, almost from ground 0 with new models of cars. That's why it's "a startup". Because it has essentially started over. And to your point about employees and market cap, you can't say it's not worth 300B then say it's a 300B company in your next argument.  We agree it hasn't yet earned it's value, and that's why I believe it's closer to a startup operating structure. They have a lot of volume to achieve to prove they are viable for the long term. 

Metrics - if you want to use strictly GAAP, the company is profitable. If you want to subtract regulatory credits from GAAP net income and not make other judgmental adjustments to ascertain true product profitability, that's poor analysis. My argument is if you want to say the core business isn't profitable, start from operating cash flow and add activity back into the mix, don't start from GAAP and go backwards. Operating cash is the corest of the core. GAAP is full of averaging and BS (I am a CPA, I have familiarity with it). 

Revenue - perhaps this is the most important part of disagreement on Tesla analysis. You are 100% correct - the things that make Tesla "not a car company" are currently tiny. The buyers of the stock aren't predicting today's or next quarter's revenue. They are predicting 2030 and 2040 self driving battery efficient unicorn cars that don't exist yet.

You don't have to believe it or buy it, but to say nothing in this report shows you anything positive is a mistake.I suggest u sell the stock whilst u can, u might be too emotional after 4 yearsThat's correct, but wouldn't that have massive implications for the price? I mean that would basically double the volume for a single day and half of it would be buy orders.[removed]and lost millions on other shitThat's a relief hahaThe more you know, the more you know you don’t know.Haha early 30s but started my career a bit late so not sure if i should go that risky just yetI agree, that's why I am not currently invested in TeslaYea. Unfortunately I talked about Tesla in January with a coworker who had great insight but decided the balance sheets didn’t justify it. Then another coworker who had zero investing knowledge mentioned he was buying Tesla stocks. Like the old saying goes “if your barber is talking to you about the stock market you’re in trouble”

Edit: once r/wsb decided to just gamble on Tesla all day I knew the stock wasn’t for me. Entertaining to see where is goes and hope it doesn’t burn to many people on the way down.The second mass market electric cars are viable and profitable, big 3 and the others will throw their production might at it and dwarf Teslaadapt or dieAll these guys saying “the market is pricing in this and that” don’t understand how short squeezes work. The market is pricing in the blatant short squeezing. Huge options purchases + common stock rally = massive coveringSales being what they are considering the tax credits went away is impressive imo. 
Proportionally I'd wager Uber has a higher level of lawyers and SDEs to support their existing product line than TSLA will. Unless 'Sergei' is hot seating with Tom and Jerry, he'll never hit the fixed cost allocation per ride that a Tesla will.And this guy invests money....holy shit.What is a couple 0s between friends?I am not sure if this is counted in the 'double', but they have 140 million deferred from 2019. From 2019 YE:

> Deferred revenue related to sales of automotive regulatory credits was $140 million and $0 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect to recognize the deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019 in the next 12 months.

EDIT: That said, without this 140 Milly which I am not sure if it is included, I get about 340 million for the rest of the year. But, if production is down, I would question where those credits are coming from? Doesn't regulatory credits presume that low energy vehicles are being produced *in California*?The VW e-Golf is not higher quality than a Model 3... I own the latter and regularly drive the former, and although I do think the Model 3's build quality is lacking a *little* vs equivalent Audi/BMW/Mercedes specs, it's still above the likes of Ford/VW/Toyota's offeringsDon’t forget that accounting for refunds and returns under warranty on your income statement is highly subjective. You can easily push up your net income by reducing that number beneath a realistic value and then going into the red a year later after your crappy products start coming back under warranty.Lol. Half of these cars don’t exist yet. The Taycan has 190 miles of range and costs 150k+. What are you smoking. 

I see you read the misleading European headline. Please elaborate on what their current market share is and what the trend is. You’re clearly an expert on the subject.You’re an idiot. Look at their 2Q filing on the IR page. Spelled out in the balance sheet.

I can’t believe the arguments in this thread. The point of investing is returns. It’s not a race to having the lowest PE ratio portfolio. My god. I’ve made life changing money on this stock this year and it’s hilarious watching people justify missing out.Great point.2016: 7B
2017: 11B
2018: 21B
2019: 24B

Stagnating??? With three more factories soon to be operating??? What universe do you live in?It does include model Y, but they are not providing Y sales. Instead they lump M3 and MY into the same bucket. I would assume because majority of those sales, probably 80%+ are M3.I think they're above 50% of all non-Tesla car manufacturers.Unless that taxpayer buys a Leaf when they need a new car. Which is kinda the whole point.I think Tesla will be very happy getting lots of cash:
https://www.jato.com/2021-co2-targets-would-generate-e34-billion-euros-in-penalty-payments-within-europe/[Exactly!](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a32346670/other-automakers-paid-tesla-record-354-million/) It really is a clever mechanism. There are various ways that these credits work, there are a few different versions, from the EPA, NHTSA, and individual states like california, or even an EU version. The gist being that often what is happening now is that governing bodies are saying that you must sell x number of electric vehicles relative to your total sales, so companies like Fiat contact Tesla and purchase their credits for EV sales. These credits then show that Fiat sold x amount of EV, even though they are Tesla's, they get to account for those vehicles and comply with the mandate.They literally just had 4 consecutive profitable quarters.Because they're the only ones taking it seriously, looks like it's working as intended to me.

If anything the incentive is too low, since the other companies still prefer paying instead of changing.harder to grow 1m then it is 80k...

Most of that growth came with first quarter

Toyota 10x the car sales, far more profitable with a lower valuationThat's US YTD car sales not world YTD EV sales. The US EV market is only the 3rd biggest 

There is a lot of competition in EVs, PHEVs and HEVsTesla is dominating all competition!How are you justifying an investment in an empty building???  Are you Chinese?I have no clue on self driving developments. Tesla is trying  to do something radical and crack the holy grail of autonomous driving. But, I sincerely think they don't have bandwidth to solve the problem well ahead of time than other companies. 

I think google knows what they are doing and they are a dedicated software company who are researching in AI and ML. Even they are cautious on level 5 Autonomous driving timeline.

I see Elon's statements on level 5 driving seems to be sensational, and misleading. It will take years to resolve edge cases, even with Cameras, LIDAR, Radar, AI and ML. 

I also don't see how Tesla can have software like profit margins (25%) while running a capital intensive business like cars, solar panels and battery packs. Car companies  have a operating margin of 4-12% max. They also generate $2 revenue per every dollar of capital invested. Elon needs A LOT of capital to generate such revenues. For example, giga 1 costed 6 billion to make 35 GWh. So, every kwH costs $175 in capital to produce.

I think his acquisition of solar city was his biggest mistake that tied a lot of money away from tesla motors. That business will forever be a loss maker and a drag on Tesla. 

Magapacks. Tesla uses third party cells. what is the scope of this business? how large is their market? I'm not sure.

sorry for the rant. I need to write this down for myself.My first buy was right out of college at around $28 a share. Been buying yearly since then. Average strike price currently is sitting at just under $300.Ok dudeNot necessarily unattainable, but extremely aggressive.No, not really. If shorts were 50%, then yeah it would have some implications. At one point shorts were a significant portion of float, but not anymore.Your submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

With a robo investor style of deposit money on a clock and it splits it you for. VOO over spy because I like the lower expense ratio since I want to pass it down. VT for global market. And VUG/VGT for growth since it's meant for 10 years personally. Once you get closer to retirement start adjusting it over to bonds> the others will throw their production might at it and dwarf Tesla

I really gotta wonder which production might people are talking about when they tout this point. At the end of the day the initial production bottleneck that Tesla had was in producing battery packs, which they've spent 10 years getting ahead of everyone in the game and built one of the largest factories in the world for it. 

Sure the big 3 can churn out chassis, but it's meaningless unless they start manufacturing batteries or building enormous (much bigger than they are aiming for right now) partnerships.The trading algorithms already have which is why the stock is so high. They are playing off the meme stock and when they are ready to sell, it might be really bad for normal TSLA investors.But Tesla won’t be the only game in town. It’s absurd to assume they will dominate the self driving market or even EV market or that EVs will be able to compete with ICE for all market segments (which is impossible until there is a big leap in battery tech to improve energy density).Cheers.

If the credits were already sold I suppose they count for previous production.> Look at their 2Q filing on the IR page.

[Here it is](https://ir.tesla.com/static-files/f41f4254-f1cc-4929-a0b6-6623b00475a6). On page 3 it says Tesla posted a 5.4% operating margin in Q2, not 25.4%. Neither of those figures would be Tesla's net operating profit after taxes, anyhow.

> Spelled out in the balance sheet.

What I'm asking for would not be "spelled out on the balance sheet". It's not on the balance sheet at all, in fact.That universe where quarters do not equal years.That's old data based on 2018 fleet emissions versus 2021 targets.  Again the industry is not standing still here and VW especially already has a greater mix of hybrids and BEVs in the mix.Only if you count the legitimate revenue streams bears have decided shouldn't count. Really easy to make something look bad if you take out all of the good stuff!I’m sure they did.  Go get yourself a cup of Luckin Coffee!How is it working as intended if companies that pay Tesla are not willing to change? Is the intention to give free money to Tesla?It’s justified if you want to keep your country’s economy going. It’s not justified if you want to make money.

Those empty apartments are for the truly wealthy to park their money. While they park the money, they’re also keeping a vital sector of their economy alive. 

Personally, I’d never buy one of those and think it’s a horrible personal investment, but the people buying those rooms aren’t strapped for cash like most people.

I’m justifying their actions based on their thinking. Not what I personally believe.You ever heard of a blind squirrel?I've been pumping mostly into vti but ill check those out! Appreciate the infoWhy buy VT if you have VOO? Just increase the amount of VOO and get VXUS instead along with VUG or VGT if you're into weighting towards growth stocks. The OP mentioned in a later post that he already has VTI, which means that he's better off holding VTI, VXUS, and VUG/VGT. Maybe something like 50% VTI, 25% VUG/VGT, and 25% VXUS.

Personally, I only hold 67% VTI and 33% VXUS because I prefer to keep things simple. Bonds like BND can come later when I'm a few years close to retirement.Not to mention the batteries literally every other company uses is inferior. I don't get why it's hard to understand that Tesla has the better materials. None of the US car companies even have R&D in material science like Tesla has. They are not trying to compete instead just stick with their status quo of building simple cars based off what they built for the last 100 years. Show me HOW any of these companies are competing, they copy shit like giant touch screens that don't even work half as well as a Tesla, and then still fill the cab with buttons because they know their screens suck.Given what I currently know, the company is on track to be the biggest player by a longshot for at least a while. You made false statements about it's funding raise, and it's profitability. You also missed the point that auto is currently a means to bigger industries entirely. If you aren't doing your research, by all means buy some puts.25.4% MARGIN ON AUTO SALES. READING COMPREHENSION. NOT OPERATING MARGIN IN SUMMATION. JESUS CHRIST.If you start evaluating trends over the next 5-10 years you’ll do much better than tunneling in on a financial spreadsheet quarter to quarter my friend.Nobody wants a hybrid anymore (only Toyota has a solid customer basis there). Tesla Killers still not in sight. Maybe VW ID lineup will be ok. Besides that it looks grim. Either the technology is not there or the production capacity (Hyundai/KIA, Nissan). 2018 is not so old in car manufacturing. Giants don't leap.Do you trust the numbers put out by Mr Musk, a certifiable liar..?It's working as intended in the way that the green company is getting money from the ones that refuse to go green, meaning the incentive is there.

But it does look like it's too small, yes, so if anything the incentive should be increased.Except that’s not their thinking - they aren’t trying to “keep your country’s economy going”.

It’s individuals holding bags of big construction companies/their local governments because they’re under the false pretense that all real estate investments are good ones.

The reality is that in South China there is humidity and general upkeep which will ruin the buildings without additional capital thrown into it.

It’s clear which apartment buildings have people living in them because they air-dry their clothes, ones without clothing lines are empty/unused.

It’s a waste of capital.

You should really read more about the ghost cities. 

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-27/vacant-apartments-strain-china-s-housing-marketMy man! *high five*Good choice, o forgot. TIP bonds if you're worried about inflation.Unless I'm thinking of the wrong ETF, VT is the global market no? VOO is similar to SPY, US market only, and I would have to be a fool to think that the US market is going to always lead.

Argeed bonds come later, but I'm talking about slowly adjusting your ratio. Like adding a percent every year 10 years away.

Also stated VTI is good in reply. 

To be perfectly clear, I stock pick personally. Course I'm picking companies I already know from my own hobbies and interests, so I can reasonably trust in their growth. All in on AMD and NVDA!!!!!! All hail the PC master race!!!!!!I think people doe understand that Tesla has a headstart on technology, but the share price is just blown so far out of proportion. To have Tesla at twice the market cap of the other major manufacturers put together (bar Toyota...) is just insanity at the moment. It assumes that they'll just fade into insignificance whilst Tesla takes over the world. Things just don't work like that.I'm merely stating financial facts. Not some hopium fanboy bs about Tesla owning the universe. Keep drinking Musk's Koolaid..The Renault Zoe is selling almost as many units as the Model 3, probably more after Q2 here given how little inventory Tesla was able to push to Europe.  The E-Tron is also doing well in Europe and even the VW E-Golf.  

A hybrid + EV strategy has also worked well for Kia: https://www.automotiveworld.com/news-releases/record-sales-of-hybrid-and-electric-cars-for-kia-motors-europe-in-challenging-first-quarter/

Like you can complain that other companies can't do this but ultimately there's no secret sauce for making an EV or hybrid vehicle really and Tesla's poor build quality and reliability as well as a preference for local manufacturers does seem to be hurting in Europe, especially the more mature markets like Norway and Denmark.As someone who owns a Model 3 and has made enough money on the stock to buy another, you're dammed right I do. 

But I'm excited for an internet rando to tell me why the guy who founded SpaceX and grew Tesla to what it is today, is actually a charlatan and a fraud.I don’t think you’re understanding. The point is for the rich to park their money for local politicians to provide them favors.

It’s an investment that keeps the economy going because they need to keep constructing even if nobody lives there.

Again, the richest can park their money there. They already do in mass for multiple reasons, but profitability is unlikely one of them. The few fools who can’t afford it that buy in are inevitable like anywhere.

They don’t intend on people living there. The wanted housing is all where people already are, not where people may be.Haha guessing you're a fan of VTI?! :)Another thing to Google haha thanks!VT is the global stock market, which includes both US and international. If you already have VOO/VTI, why get something that's somewhat redundant? Might as well buy the actual asset class that VOO/VTI doesn't cover: international stocks excluding US, which VXUS covers.I’ll keep making 300% returns while you miss out, thanksZoe is a fine car. Hyundai/KIA has fine cars too. I don't say they can't. They did not want to and now they need time until they can. I hope you will be very happy with your Renault, VW and FCA shares 😄
Money, mouth, you know the deal...It’s my go-to dumping grounds for extra cash, indeed.See that's my mistake. Didn't know VT covered the US also. In which case VXUS would be the choice, though I'm risky so I go towards growth. Nice to know though[removed]You realize nothing I’m saying here is a bull thesis for incumbent automakers right?  They’ll likely have higher capital costs and lower margins for a while due to compliance costs here, they just likely won’t be paying them to Tesla.Nice!

Sounds bullish to me.That article about 2018 emissions level was your best effort wasn't it?  I just explained why it isn't, and you're slowly segueing into the same completely subjective measures on which to justify Tesla's valuation like 'innovation' already.  Clearly many of the incumbents aren't having any trouble innovating or competing if they're continuing to pull market share from Tesla here even in the BEV market, but let's just ignore all that because hey clearly Tesla is the only company that can 'innovate' here.If you have any data proofing that in 2019 everything changed bring it. And don't start dreaming up that I wrote anything about valuation or that others can never innovate. You said after FCA deal Tesla is done getting emission regulations money. Time will tell.> If you have any data proofing that in 2019 everything changed bring it.

That's not even the argument being made, it's that by 2021 most manufacturers should be close enough not to have to pay Tesla money.  Period.

> And don't start dreaming up that I wrote anything about valuation or that others can never innovate.

Right after saying this in previous post:

> They dodge fines while keeping to make money off their ice technology without the need to innovate.

> You said after FCA deal Tesla is done getting emission regulations money.

Zach said on the CC they're expecting roughly 2x the emissions credit money this year that they had last year so they're already through most of that after Q2 here.  FCAs plan is for the bulk to be spent here in 2020 too, it's possible Tesla will carry some over into Q1 2021 to smooth out earnings, but thus far this is a temporary period of higher income.  Anything can change going forward but that's where expectations are currently per Tesla's own guidance.Ok we are getting somewhere. Now "should be close enough" is based on nothing but your faith in these companies and just ignoring recent years and data from 2018 because it's outdated. To me it seems you have no clue how car companies and big corporations work in the inside at all.

We're literally talking about future events, hard data doesn't exist to prove anything one way or another.  I'm basing what I'm saying off of public commentary by the leadership of these companies, particularly FCA who is the only party that currently has a large pooling agreement with Tesla in the EU where this relevant.

> To me it seems you have no clue how car companies and big corporations work in the inside at all.

I think we're done here.  This the second time you've veered right off from the topic at hand to some other random implication that I should either go long companies that will be making less money or apparently now "don't understand how big companies work inside".    If you had anything of any real value to add here you would have said it by now and I've got no interest in pursuing this further.Sorry, I hurt your feelings. On the plus side you may have learnt something which will safe you your money in the future.

People primarily think of LinkedIn as a social media website, but they've got a [huge B2B side](https://business.linkedin.com/) that sells hiring and sales solutions for companies.

* Want to hire people? LinkedIn has the richest data on people's skillsets and job search activity. This helps hiring teams reach out and close candidates faster. 
* Want to sell your B2B SaaS product? LinkedIn shows where different people are in an organization and what they do. For example, if you're trying to sell Salesforce, you'll know if you're talking to the CTO, Director of Sales, or a Sales Rep, and be able to position your pitch accordingly.

So while LinkedIn does many a good chunk of change from advertising on their social media platform, they have a huge sales team that sells these SaaS solutions to other businesses.You aren't thinking about this in the right way.  1000 layoffs means linked in gets actively used by 1000 people, increased sales. 

MSFT to the moon!Wonder if LinkedIn will give them a discount on premium to help with the job searchI do not think anything linkedin does moves the needle for MSFT stock (in terms of how material their results are to the parent company), and is also run quite independently. Would not read much in relation to MSFTA lot of jobs on the recruitment side ... would not surprise me if AI replaces them in the long-run - I don’t think LinkedIn will be a big focus of the earnings callWhy do people keep stating that layoffs means that a company isn't performing well? In the age of automation layoffs mean efficiency as often as they mean losses.They had more than 1k employees?ITT: A lot of young people that don’t understand how LinkedIn works and the value it provides to those in professional careers.Strange as I have seen an incredibly uptick of business activity on LinkedIn since covid started. I imagined the opposite would have happened but perhaps the layoffs fit into a broader strategy.This is a positive for the stock price. Shows me that the company is taking the right steps to survive and working for the shareholder. It sucks that people lose their job but as an investor, they did the right thing.They should post their resumes on LinkedIn.Unemployed people sure does get the wealthy to nut their pants.Maybe now I'll have less recruiters spamming meDoes anyone still even use LinkedIn? I deleted my account because all I got was spam from "recruiters" and your typical MLM scammers.LinkedIn be just full of shit flexes, sob story fairytales and political agendas now, I used to like it for the news aspect, not anymoreSo there’s going to be 1,000 more active users on LinkedIn? MSFT i see you cooking the numbersWhat does Microsoft have to do with this?LinkedIn has 15k employees which I find utterly astonishing. How many folk does it take to develop their webpage? I think a lot of these companies have too excessive an employee count for the RoI.wow

Next from Google MV headquarter.[removed][removed]Well played.Not a great sign for the white collar labor market...BULLISH!!!!LinkedIn as whole is too nonconsequential for MSFT.It's only recruiters and sales reps though. Not all that bad. Other companies have been laying off all job types across the board.You can tell investing noobs that don't understand financing that think layoffs are bearish.I was just searching up LinkedIn internship opportunities this morning lol. Guess that's not happeningThis isn't as insane as it seems to be, LinkedIn is only 5% of Microsofts revenue[removed][removed]In the same sense "reading the tea leaves" of the below article you could say Microsoft has gained such a commanding lead over Slack that they're being sued for it.

 https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/07/22/slack-accuses-microsoft-of-anticompetitive-practices-in-eu-complaint.htmlWhat percentage of their employees is 1000?This is a good thing lolI was surprised they even have thousend people to lay off and even more surprised to read the wiki that they actually have 15000+ employes!At least they will have somewhere to put their resume
The company that ostensibly will get you your next job lays off its own employees!

My sides are aching 😄I still can't tell if LinkedIn is spam or legit after M$ bought it.Linked in was dead years ago.  Its nothing but mlm bullshit and endless adds to shit youve never heard of and will never hear of again.Roommate works there.

They have an entire floor of employees in the Empire State Building.

Apparently they "used to" make a lot of money.I hate seeing people lose jobs but isn’t this potentially a good thing in the long run?In this thread. People reading tea leaves about the coming earnings call.LinkedIn to be the next Skype or the next Lionhead Studios. Either way MSFT sux.Pretty sure this is about mixer being shut down. That website was trash. MSFT is going to print, easy money.Is an 80-20 Portfolio Good For Long Term?

I am currently planning to make a portfolio of 7000$ right now. Here are my picks. I am not looking to trade, just planning on investing for the long term. And yes, the portfolio is tech heavy because that seems to be the direction we are heading (I think). So I have planned to put 80% of my portfolio into ETF's and the rest 20% into what I believe are 'growth' stocks. My question is, is the 80-20 evaluation good for long term (20 years+) investing? I will be adding 300-500$ every month. Also I need your opinions on these individual growth stocks and would like to know any more additional growth stocks for the future.

Core S&P 500 (IVV) : 40%

NASDAQ 100 (EXXT): 40%

NET: 5%

EBAY: 5%I rem when Linked In didn't suckInterestingly they haven't stopped [their H1b hires.](https://www.myvisajobs.com/Visa-Sponsor/Linkedin/322267.htm)I’m not a genius since I only took a semester in financial accounting but as far as income statement goes, those 1k employees can be taken off from the liabilities to make the financial statements look nicer than they really are. 

Again I may be wrong.This should be higher. People in this thread don't understand the full scope of LinkedIn's business model.I built my whole business because of LinkedIn. It just shows how clueless most people are and why I really take the general advice in this sub with a grain of salt. The real info is always in the comments. LinkedIn is one of the platforms that flies over people's head. Job seeking is what it is known for but it is so much more than that.You're 100% correct. Sometimes it's tough to find common sense in this sub. Reading through a lot of people think LinkedIn is just a website to look for a job. Their data collection model is one of the best in the business, plus, it helps that they are owned by Microsoft. I would draw a better comparison to Facebook. If you go into the settings you can see how much info is being collected and ultimately data=$$$Was the same shit with Uber. Obviously a lot of companies can trim the fat, but seriously a bunch of people always ask "Why does uber need xx thousand engineers? It's just an app"LinkedIn has just bonkers quality data. They have become a huge part of our lead gathering (Sales Navigator is amazing), data gathering and market research.

The recruitment side of things barely registers for us.this is the type of info that i treasure reddit for. thanks for posting. 

i have the same questions about things like facebook. i similarly don’t understand why people are throwing money at them. surely the bulk of their earnings aren’t from small business advertising ( the same small businesses that are woefully impacted by covid!)As a LinkedIn user, I like and also hate their business model. It's great for finding jobs, in fact my last 3 jobs have all been via LinkedIn. However the amount of spam you get from sales creatures is absolutely appalling, Datadog have been the worst offenders recently (don't get me started on them) but low grade recruiters are the most common kind of spam you'll get on there even when you're not flagged as "looking for work". 

I feel like I'd use it far more than I do currently if it wasn't for all the spam. At the moment I only ever go on there when I want some, ie a job, and flag all incoming mail from LinkedIn as spam (since their subscribe apparently doesn't work).I work at a small recruiting agency and each person needs their access to LinkedIn Recruiter and the seats are crazy expensive. Imagine how many recruiting agencies/internal teams are purchasing these.As an HR Consultant let me tell you what I notice LinkedIn can do that no other company is doing right now, and how I believe this will be super powerful soon.

LinkedIn recently started asking people to define who is their managers, colleagues, and subordinates are... which basically builds virtual Org Charts.

Additionally, they can know how the workforce is moving between companies, and have great insights like where are most of your employees are going, or where your employees are coming from, whether be it a company or a university, match that data with your high performers and you can start to identify your most efficient talent pool.

tie all of this together, and you can build a Talent Management System that crosses companies' boundaries. As soon as LinkedIn starts providing Performance Management tracking alongside their Recruitment and Learning systems. LinkedIn basically has all the components to win the Talent game from the big players like SAP/Oracle/Workday...etc.LinkedIn learning is another B2B service they offer.  If your company signs up employees get access to tons of free hours of training.How does LinkedIn make money from the second one exactly?what does itt meanCool. Now, how does Snapchat make money?I'm dumbfounded that people don't know that.In other words, less people are hiring and as such spending less money on LinkedIn.Also sales toolsAnd now people should understand why Microsoft bought LinkedInSo, like Zoominfo and Uplead?So Tesla is going up?Idk man, I keep getting ads for HR software and I work in Shipping & ReceivingSalesforce already had a product to do that to sell Salesforce but people thought it was too creepy and shut it down for the most partApparently, that sales team might not be that huge pretty soon.And LinkedIn Premium.There is also LinkedIn Learning. An e-learning platform that companies can pay for.Want to find a job?  Yes, LinkedIn will exploit you for that as well!LinkedIn makes no money does it? It was acquired my Microsoft? Have they made a profit before?i -was- on -linkedin the- other -day -stalking -my --ex -girlfire-nd-. -it- looks -like -shitty -social- media -website -now. -reminded- -me -of -google- hangout. -and -then -looking -at -her -res-ume -or -skillse-t. -it- was -absolutely -bullshit.- pleaee -ignore -the -dashes -my -keyboard- is -brokenWow, tell us more. Can you tell us more, or did you read a brochure?Great idea! You can just fire half your workforce every month and generate copious amounts of customers ad infinitum.You joke but it was weird seeing 30+ posts on LinkedIn today from people looking for jobs on the platform of the company that just fired them.High unemployment = bullish for linkedin.All LinkedIn employees get Premium for free. They also get 10 six-month premium "gifts" every year they can give to anyone. I usually gift it to friends or family that are looking for jobs.LinkedIn employees (FTE) that leave or are separated become alums and retain premium for free forever.As insulting as that may be to offer that on the way out the door, it would be even more offensive not to.It is a sign that LinkedIn is maturing as a social media platform. Linkedin used to be operated like a startup company so they typically have lots of engineers on staff to build out the site to its maximum potential. When the site matures, they cut costs and then just run the site as-is without much new features. Overall it is a good strategy. You lose money in the startup phase but then make huge profits in the mature phase because you have low operating costs. It is cheap to operate a website when the development phase is over.If anything recruitment jobs will rise as they have been. Hunting passive candidates is the big thing now and AI can’t do that.Where did you read it was on the recruitment side?Obviously my experience is anecdotal but I find linkedin to be soooooo stupid. Just random recruiters for fields 8 degrees away from mine in manufacturing just pumping out random ass form letter recruitment stuff. Not trying to be a dick about it and would love to hear alternative stories of success.Because the layoffs are on the sales side. Meaning sales arent what they would like them to be. Growth is coming in low due and less companies are using their recruiting services.> Why do people keep stating that layoffs means that a company isn't performing well?

It couldn't possibly be because a global pandemic has caused companies to spend less on hiring or anything...Amen.  Hopefully the stock goes UP after trimming the faf.And that’s only 6% of their global workforce apparently (per the article)I can't believe this is the top comment. I know it's a joke, but this shows the complete disconnect between this sub and reality. LI has 600M+ registered users and, if you use it, you'll notice it has gone hard into social engagement vs just job seeking. That's complex in terms of engineering work.

If you think you can manage that scale of a platform with a team of 50 engineers, you're out of your mind. Nevermind the sales, marketing, CX teams, etc.Its pretty crazy to see how people on here have no understanding of the sheer amount of person hours it takes to build and maintain a massive company like LinkedIn. I couldn't imagine a platform like it existing with less than 15-20k employees.A hell of a lot more. They leased an entire new 26 floor building in downtown SF for like 4000 employees in 2016 or so, then built a second headquarters in Sunnyvale not 2 years later for another 3200.That’s what I was thinking, why do they need so many employees?Probably salesShhhh dont look behind the curtains of tech ...lolSeriously. My wife and I both found new jobs recently and LinkedIn was absolutely invaluable. We were even looking for jobs in Europe where LinkedIn doesn't have that strong of a presence, but we still found it more useful and usable than Xing, the German social networking site.

Granted, the usefulness varies per industry and there's a whole lot of shameless self-promoters.It's amazing how many here are spewing misinformation and getting high upvotes. Goes to show that if you act confident, like you know what you're saying, people will believe anything.What do you consider to be a professional career? Just curious.No I get it but it’s shit.

My gf is a recruiter at a top company so I understand. I still think it’s Facebook for adults. Fucking dumb.Pets.com provided value too yoDoesn't matter. You don't need to keep 1,000 engineers on staff just because of an "uptick in business activity". Everything is on autopilot.Good way to get a leg up in the lucrative world of door-to-door knife sales.I do. I work in finance, I feel like all of my coworkers use it. I don’t like using it though.I constantly get job offers from it, legit ones too, it’s how I got my current job. It works well for my career field I’d sayI do. You can always turn off emails from recruiters if you aren't looking, and that seems to get rid of 90% of emails.

IMO its a great site for finding work. Don't need to waste all day filling out the same information onto a companies website just to apply for a job, instead you can just wait for recruiters to reach out directly to you.Their job boards are very high-quality (at least for IT stuff) and I've found that it is still essential for keeping up with networking from folks at previous jobs.  Most people I run into in professional networking settings request to connect on LinkedIn rather than exchanging personal email addresses or phone numbers.Yes. I’d bet money it’s the largest jobs board on the internet. I got multiple calls and emails from it recently.I'm in a niche Finance field and get legit job offers all the time (even post COVID). I think it really depends on your industry.My wife is a recruiter. In certain industries it still remains a fantastic resource to source talent. It’s a weird ecosystem but it continues to provide professionals in certain niche industries a way to create visibility for themselves. LinkedIn’s Recruiter pricing is moving too high to continue to be sustainable and recruiting firms are leaning into usage and development of different tools. But LinkedIn is still the big gun in their arsenal for Computer Engineer roles, sales roles, and some Executive level roles.It has its purpose. While I'm not actively checking LinkedIn regularly because I don't really need it daily, when it does come time for active job hunting, LinkedIn is a HUGE asset.

So while we may sparingly use it in our own lives (maybe once every 3-5 years), there's always MILLIONS of people at any given time that are at that time of *their* life where they need to use LinkedIn.I get legit job offers from it. High success rateI used to use it pretty often while I was applying for jobs. I occasionally use it now, but I stay away from my feed at all cost. It’s turned into recruiters jacking off to themselves and posting how they found a gem despite so many red flagsIt's pretty standard in the business world. The problem is I used it once every few years when looking to switch jobs. Outside of that, I don't check it often and don't care about all the status updates and click-bait articles.Yes.  I work in accounting and just used it to land my next job.In the Netherlands students are recommended to make accountsengagement with linkedin is inversely correlated with how much you actually perform at your current job. My feed is spammed with the biggest frauds trying to promote themselvesYeah, it’s the place you flex your career to former classmates and friends in a socially acceptable way. No I don’t do the cringe posts, just my profile speaks for itself.Yes, despite the fact that the large majority of the posts are complete shit, it's actually a great sales, jobs and networking tool. I find 95% of my prospects via LI. I don't actually use it as a social network though.Yes. It’s nice, just have to ignore all of that bs. If you join the right groups for interesting topics and only accept the right people it’s nice to kill time at workI'm forced to....my company laid out a FORTUNE for all of us to take mandatory training with an outside company that specalize in nothing but LinkedIn.  It was an obnoxious, intensive training.I personally don't like using it and haven't updated it in like 10 years. That being said I seem to encounter heavy users at every workplace I'm at. Some of my former coworkers would basically treat it as facebook sort of. I got confused so I didn't delve into the specifics.as an engineer, that’s where most legit job postings will be, aside from the company’s actual websiteYes, to get in contact with actual recruiters.I have one and I don’t even know why. Never use it. Just have one because it’s weird in the corporate world if you don’t....I stopped using it when I switched careers from recruiting to sales. I still have the account, but no longer pay for it.Omg , linked in is like a Wet dream for recruiters and other scammers.. virtually anyone who connects with you is unsolicited is a recruiter.I've only used it for a year before deactivating it for the exact reason you described. All the jobs I've landed, I've gotten because of offline connections or just applying on the company website. No one has ever dinged me for not being on LinkedIn, or as I now call it, LinkedOut.Microsoft owns LinkedIn.  I didn't know this either.Lmao you have no clue what Linkedin does. How does shit like this get upvotedThey’re probably starting a food delivery service. LinkedIn Eats.Now you know how hard and complicated tech isHaha lol haha I bet Facebook has less than 1000 people running their "webpage" hahaIt’s for their corporate motivation circle jerksIt's a platform that serves a global population and bolsters their hiring industries. Microsoft is in the business of software automation.You could say the same about any "app" company: Uber, Snapchat, etc.Intersectional gender studies, community managers, LGBT outreach reps, book club guides, these are big departments.Your submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

They ear a higher dollar revenue per user but it's comparatively low volume.

I also imagine their largest advetisers are recruiting, not necessarily large B2B.If they are getting computers to do the work of the laid off employees (no more sick days, sexual harrassment, office gossip & politics and the present day PC environment based on a culture of victimhood, entitlement, and identity politics) then it's a great thing for the bottom line. Or they figured out how to get the same output from fewer employees which means lower costs.

But going long or short on news is plain dumb.

There were constant catered events too. Those peeps were living large.When was this? LolIf you read a little bit deeper, you will see that the layoffs are sales and recruiting, and the hires are tech, so this doesn’t strike me as being weird.People in this subreddit don't understand most scope of any company's business model\*

Fixed that for you. This sub is good for reading through any news I may have missed but you get to the comments and it's a nightmare.I still find it funny why people questioned Microsoft purchasing Linkedin for the amount they did.To be fair, neither does LinkedInCan you tell me what the Business model of LinkedIn is? I'm a 16 year old boy so I don't have that much knowledge about it except that it is the place to be for making job connections.I think linkedin is a more powerful platform for b2b and all personal/professional growth related businesses, hence why many consumers do not have clear how it makes money. It is also a more curated, less toxic (and probably less engaging and more poorly monetized because of it) social media, in my opinion - but that may turn out to be a strength in a few yearsWhat kinda business?I think it's wholly unfair to call everyone clueless because they do not fully understand your specific industry. I'm sure I could dismiss your opinion on any given topic if I quizzed you on data engineering practices yet I'm sure you have much to contribute in other areas.Yeah dude, i think its a very underutilized website. I am in the wood products / mass timber design business and the the amount of relevant connections ive made is huge. Although a lot of connections arent useful to me now, they certainly will be when i eventually start my own company. Therefore great for entrepreneurs tooCan you tell me what the Business model of LinkedIn is? I'm a 16 year old boy so I don't have that much knowledge about it except that it is the place to be for making job connections.So you're ok with Microsoft owning a part of your business huh?  Interesting.Go find a subject that you're somewhat an expert in and look at the average DD. It's elementary level shit that can be disproven with a Google search by a layman, or with a basic knowledge of the subject. Even top voted comments often don't have intro industry level knowledge. That's reddit in a nutshell, but even more important if you're putting money on the line.

People just love running their mouth and typing it out, rather than spending that same time [Googling and finding the answer in the top result. ](https://www.feedough.com/how-linkedin-makes-money/)>	You're 100% correct. Sometimes it's tough to find common sense in this sub.

I think this sub is great for learning about investing. I mean that literally, like the mechanics of investing, options you do/don't have, technical details, etc. but once you understand the process and you're actually ready to put money down you need to get off this sub.> plus, it helps that they are owned by Microsoft

Thanks, I was looking for the connection with MSFT mentioned in the title.> They have become a huge part of our lead gathering

This is actually why I've abandoned my linkedin.  Rather than it furthering my career, it just ended up with me inundated with people trying to sell me highly targeted shit that was relevant to my field.

Don't get me wrong - I do respect it as a business, but I fucking hate it as an end-user.Facebook makes massive $ from small business advertising. Think about it this way—that bagel shop down the street isn’t going to spend $100k on TV advertising; they’re going to spend $500 on Facebook ads. 

All of the businesses that historically advertised in the local newspapers and radio stations are now sending much of that $ to Facebook.They offer solutions to businesses as well (Workplace by Facebook).  Also, data is very valuable. Facebook has a massive amount of data about a massive amount of people from all over the world.Like another reply said, small medium businesses are the bulk of their advertising revenue actually. An estimate for the July boycott said it won't hurt FB since their top 100 largest advertisers only made up around 20% of their total revenue. FB has a seriously robust longtail business.Spam? Or an individual simply doing their job. Hopefully in most cases they selected you for a reason and that reason being that you could be a fit for their product or job position. They put time and due diligence into these messages.Sponsored content and Linkedin premium.Speaking of this sub not knowing what it's talking about.  LinkedIn had a loss of almost $1bn in 2018('19 hasn't been released yet).  And MSFT reported increases in operating expenses of 15% and acquisitions  which means it's safe to expect 2019 will have a higher deficit.  Not to mention MS paid almost $30bn for them, so amortized they'll be a loss for MS even when they're turning profit.

MSFT has invested a lot in their B2B services and incorporated LinkedIn with their Azure division.  So, it's definitely a big part of their future vision for the company and an area they wish to grow, but it's ironic that you're downvoted under the comment saying nobody here knows what they're talking about.

https://www.businessofapps.com/data/linkedin-statistics/#3Linkedin is MSFT's most profitable division.Holy shit if I'm only firing half every time I'll never run out of staff!Can I have one?How does LinkedIn Premium help with job searches? I thought it was just for lurking without appearing in "People Viewed Your Profile"...Probably helps that LinkedIn doesn't seem to have any real competition.They didn't fire and don't plan to fire any engineers. They only fired sales, recruiting, and marketing staff.I mean, let’s wait for Microsoft to comment on it before declaring victory? So much speculation and sugar coating here.Did you read the article? Growth and hiring has halted quite a bit so they only slashed folks in sales, recruiting, and marketing as there less work for them now. Additionally, they have pushed back the start date for the new grads in sales until January 2021 while the tech new grads (SWE + PM) are still starting on time.If the jobs were engineers that they were cutting, you would imagine MSFT can take bright minds like those.Lmao, it's a sign that recruiting is down.Got my current job via LinkedIn recruiter. I simply keep my profile nice and updated, put out the relevant information and recruiter made a specific offer and intro to the business unit. Fast forward, started there (Fortune 50) last month.An alternative view would be that they're selling fine without the bodies since you can just do it all online with a cc card and they don't need that many reps.  I think your version is right though.  I know I'm laying people off right now, not hiring.... or that human sales teams aren't providing the growth that they're seeing from automated onboarding platforms.You think that with all of people out of work, that linkedin doesn't have traffic? I would argue that overall traffic is up (I never use my linked in unless I'm looking for work and that's been like 5 years). My guess is that they have automated sales to a large extent, not done away with sales entirely.

Edit: that said I sold a bunch of my shares a couple weeks ago due to how overvalued the company is. I think I still have like 10% of my shares.Could be strategic shift to self serve ads. Sales reps are only needed for the huge deals.Wow less people are trying to start a business during a global pandemic.

That’s so weird.Mmmm, faf...JesusThe same people are investing in those companies without knowing how things work. 

I own a tiny company with a couple of people in my team and I wish we were already bigger so I could hire more people and unload so many things. I remember of reading in HN that recruiting was the biggest concern on most startups. That being said instagram manage to do it without thousands of people but their products is very simple. Linkedin is just massive and a different kind of monster.Agreed, most people don’t realize how massively complex software at the scale of an “app” like linked-in is.

Software has negative economies of scale, ie it gets more expensive as you get more users for the same functionality.Not really, I bet that you have never worked on tech or really never been at a high enough position to understand how the tech stack really works. Roughly only 10% of engineers at any software companies are critical or were involved with developing the core pieces of the software that makes the companies where they are today.

The rest are just add-on fats and non-essentials.No one, person or business, should be leasing real estate in San Fran. It's just insanely expensive.So they can have enough people to send everyone messages to sign up for the premium membership /sTo write elaborate posts on the LinkedIn engineering blog.

(Some of them are really good.)It's just an app right?Engineering, product, sales, marketing, HR, recruiting. They also have offices in 30 countries. Pretty easy to hire thousands of employees if you’re doing all that.Enterprise sales & supportUpgrade your role in LinkedIn to "manager" and you'll get at least 5 messages a week from their sales team asking if you want to hire someone. 

That will shine some light on what they do. 

Or switch yourself to an HR role and they'll sell you all sorts of LinkedIn pro stuff.idk, but I will say that at their UK office they have a think tank which seems absolutely decadent for what the company isI don’t work in tech but I always wondered how places like twitter or Instagram have so many employees.  Like, what do they do?! 

Half joking but half seriousSalesAnd engineering, product, recruiting, finance, HR. No part of building a website that serves hundreds of millions of users is easy.Ding ding ding.  And recruiting staff.I already knew that.

I learned it by reading posts on LinkedIn.That sounds like almost all the posts I read from LinkedIn itself....lmao.#intern2020*[Not Op, but to me something along the lines of this.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional)

I've gotten all my salary jobs off of linkedin
.I work in the film industry and I used Facebook as my networking app for jobs/coworkers. I don't really need to use social media to network anymore. But I would have much rather used LinkedIn for networking than Facebook. I could see a huge benefit for most people to keep social media and a career networking app separate.I would imagine something like Indeed or Monster are bigger but LI is definitely up there and much easier.I get contacted by recruiters on LinkedIn. Most of them clearly did not read my profile. Both me and the recruiters wasted time. I guess LinkedIn is the winner in this story.They paid $26 billion for it a few years ago.TILHow does shit like [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hvdisj/linkedin_announces_1000_layoffs_ahead_of_msft/fyspwmw/) get upvoted? Everyone here is spreading misinformation. This sub is garbage. It's no wonder why people say they find success doing the opposite of what everyone here tells you to do.You forgot /s ?It doesn't have to be that hard. WhatsApp had 35 engineers and 450 million users when it was acquired by Facebook.It's amazing how people automatically think maintaining a "webpage" is so easy. Sure, if it was just a webpage, it should be easy to maintain. But these companies are much more than that.No, offices are great when some employees are harassed and discriminated against.

I'm a 16 year old boy so I don't have that much knowledge about it except that it is the place to be for making job connections.> People ~~in this subreddit~~ don't understandYou are also participating in the reddit comments. So what do we make of yours?I just expected more out of the investing sub (maybe that was my mistake). That is exactly the strength of LinkedIn. If someone asks me to hop on a call on Facebook or Instagram, I am like wtf. This person is a scammer or a weirdo. On LinkedIn (you have to filter) but it always leads to opportunity for me or people I know.LinkedIn is great! I have a lot of clients via LinkedIn and I always recommend people to get a Premium version of the product to get the taste of things. The ROI on being part of the network is amazing!It's consulting, workshops, speaking engagements, and career development services for business and job seekers. One of my good friends who I met on LinkedIn actually taught me all the things I didn't know about the career development space. I have other connections who gave me really good advice for free about other areas of my business that I am developing.

I have a podcast and 90% of my guests are from LinkedIn connections/referrals. I got guests I normally wouldn't be able to get. I've also been a guest on many podcasts and that has helped me in many ways. My business is prime for the LinkedIn demographic and platform.

I hired 2 virtual assistants off of LinkedIn and my podcast editor off of there. I know people who sift through Fiverr but you really have to go through a lot of people to find some good ones that aren't super expensive. I also have a plan of who exactly I will hire as my company grows over the next few years.

I also launched a virtual events business with 4 people I met on LinkedIn during the start of Covid and that is going really well. I've developed a lot of great connections who are amazing referral sources. Most people don't know how to network effectively and so therefore don't get how to use LinkedIn effectively.

I know a lot of people that do extremely well in different areas and LinkedIn is their funnel. They put in work but the returns are ridiculously high.Sorry for not being clear. It is fine to be clueless about other industries. It is not okay to make comments like "hurrr durr LinkedIn makes money?" in an investing sub and talk as if you know what you are talking about. I don't talk as if I am an authority on data engineering companies because I don't have the knowledge to do so.Exactly. If I ever wanted to move to a different industry or wanted to get a regular job, I can get a referral to many of the top companies.Job postings, recruiting licenses/solutions, sales navigator, and advertising.You're completely right. Honestly we don't know if we're talking to an 18 year old in the other side of the screen that can't read an earnings report. I gotta get off Reddit but there are some gems every once in a while. Just gotta refrain from commenting. Even in substance where I truly am an expert in the field I get weird arguments and hypotheticals that are not even applicable and get downvoted to hell lol.But hasn't the recent market proven that fundamentals and objective reality in general no longer matter?  The majority \*is\* the market, whether they are ignorant or informed.  Any rational investor had been shorting, buying puts, or selling calls for months.  But a large number of idiots with money to spend are willfully oblivious to economic reality. That doesn't make them wrong insofar as the market is concerned.  If anything, it makes the rational investors wrong.  In other words, the market is no longer rational.They haven't always owned them, of course. It's somewhat recent (2016): https://news.microsoft.com/2016/06/13/microsoft-to-acquire-linkedin/And the part that people miss, is that FB has very good tools so that bagel shop down the street can present ads to exactly the right the people. Also, based on what I've read and my own limited experience, it works.i get a lot of downvotes for this, but it’s quite clear that small businesses have been gutted by Covid. For the life of me, i can understand why facebook stock is is up there. 

Amazon makes perfect sense, Facebook just doesn’t make sense (aside from your comment that it’s simply a seriously robust business model)No they don't put any time into it, and it's quite obvious. Good recruiters do put time and effort into their messages and make sure to contact the right people, but the VAST majority are not good recruiters. 

You're right though, it is just an individual doing their job. Unfortunately their job is to spam people about jobs they're quite literally not asking for. I've never contacted 99% of these people before in my life yet they still contact me out of the blue - that's spam. 

For example, here's one I got two days ago:

>Dear <my name>,   
>  
>I hope you are doing well.   
>  
>I came across your details on LinkedIn/Seek.   
>  
>I would love to have a chat with you as I’m currently looking for <My exact, current job title> role with one of clients in <location>.   
>  
>Please let me know if you'd be interested in having a chat to find out more about the role and what we can offer.   
>  
>Kind Regards,  
>  
><their name>

This exact same person had sent me this exact same message a year ago when my job title was slightly different. Note also that they've apparently found my details on "LinkedIn/Seek" - hasn't even gone to the effort of narrowing down which site they're messaging me on. 

That message is almost identical to the others I get on a weekly basis. Friday afternoons seem to be the most popular time where I'll get between 3 and 4 over the course of a couple of hours, normally with another 5 or so during the rest of the week.Don't be fooled, they throw a big fucking copy paste net and hope to catch a few people. 

Any other way is not a good use of their time.Do you have any link with evidence? Because this sounds like complete BS to me. How does it compare to cloud or office?>In the 2019 fiscal year, LinkedIn brought in $6.8 billion worth of revenue, contributing to $38.1 billion of commercial cloud revenue for Microsoft, which in turn made up part of $126 billion total revenue.

https://www.businessofapps.com/data/linkedin-statistics/#3

First, and every other, result on Google disagrees.  That article has everything you could want to know about LinkedIn, and they're still running at almost $1bn deficit due to amortized investments and expenses related to B2B service.  They're nowhere near the most profitable division of MSFT, or even profitable piece of Azure Cloud Services(the division in MS they are part of).  Their 6.8 BN revenue isn't even 1/4 of Cloud revenue, and Azure itself(along with Surface, OS, Office, etc) all have profits.

MS also paid almost $30bn for LinkedIn a couple years ago, so even once the company is in the black, it will still take time to become a profit for MS, and much longer to overtake OS or Enterprise as "most profitable division".What? I don't believe that. No way it makes more than office or cloud.Me too? If your feeling extra generousYou can contact hiring managers and recruiters before they contact you, access the learning platform, see insights on job postings (analytically check if the job is for you), and you get to see if your profile is being viewed and who is seeing it. All of which can help make connections which lead to a job.I work in recruiting. From the posts I am seeing it's mainly sales people. My department was half furloughed since hiring basically stopped. So we got rid of half our LinkedIn seatsGlassdoor is the only one that instantly pops into my head.In person sales staff (e.g., relationship building) roles are indeed losing out (because of the virus) presently.I mean if we didn’t have the context of all of 2020 then yes laying off 1000 people could be a sign of a good thingListen here fafIt's crazy when you realize how much goes into tech businesses, thousands and thousands of employees.Uh, no. Economy of scale is about per-user cost, not total cost.

Software itself always has huge economies of scale, and infrastructure and operations for web-scale services have slightly positive economies of scale.

It might *look* like they have negative economies of scale if you naively consider the amount companies like Linkedin spend on engineering and operations. That's because they are optimizing for revenue growth and long term profitability. If Linkedin wanted to just provide their core service in perpetuity they could slash costs to a fraction of what they spend.

EIDT: this post is sarcastic lolTake it with a grain of salt like everything else, of course.

Cute downvote though.They are the only ones who know anything about anything, duh!  Well, also everyone else agreeing with them not realizing the irony.Fascinating. Mind me asking what you were doing before you started all these businesses from LinkedIn? Were you in consulting anyway?Yeah man linkedin crushesAnything to read to learn how to network better on Linkedin? I am good with Facebook, don't use Linkedin as much for prospecting referral partners.I think that usually points to more technical analysis, not blindly talking out of your ass about an industry you don't know about. There is something to be said about the influence of unknowledgeable retail investors, but it only becomes specifically relevant in cases like Hertz or TLSA instead of TSLA. 

Legit DD is especially relevant in this context of earnings calls. Someone who thinks LinkedIn hasn't updated their platform in 5 years and thinks it doesn't take more than 1000 people to run literally has no idea what they're taking about and likely doesn't have the money to back it up. In other words, their presence is felt in their words rather than in their dollar and market influence; they're probably a 20 year old with $1k in the market.Thanks!An old boss of mine tried to short LinkedIn right before Microsoft announced its intention to buy.  He took a bath on that oneSMBs are hurt by COVID but many are still going to invest in marketing. They can't expect organic sales from nearby footfall these days. They also maybe gave up their retail location and purely an online business now. Facebook is a more developed advertising platform and more effective advertising choice over Amazon for a number of SMBs. SMBs are also service companies which can't leverage Amazon.  Amazon is also loosing ground to Shopify for a more direct comparison of how larger  advertisers feel about potentially being overly reliant on Amazon.

And look at Facebooks cost to revenue comparisons. Much better than Google ever was. It's a money making machine. With governments not doing anything about Facebook's "issues", they will surely continue to draw more $ until they're dethroned. This could be by Tiktok or Gen Z giving up on social media. Not sure this behavior shift will happen.There are 2 types of messages that recruiters have access to on their LinkedIn side, 1:1 and bulk. You sir/lady have been receiving the bulk version. It's intent is to save time by allowing the recruiter to cast a wide net and message a big group at once. However, as you've experienced, they often come across as spam. 

Working with recruiters to have them spend more time narrowing their search finding the exact right candidates who are open to receiving messages (not just open to opportunities) can be tough and it's where the best recruiters shine because they are able to send those tailored, 1:1 messages and get you talking to them. 

My advice, don't fully disregard the bulk messages because you might eventually get a diamond in the rough but never disregard the personalized message because know that the recruiter spent an extra amount of time finding you and you are potentially very well suited for the role they have. 
ABC: always be communicating-with-very-good recruitersIt had 6.8bn revenue, Cloud has close to 40bn total though.(LinkedIn is part of Azure division in MS).  MSFT itself had 130bn revenue(all 2019 numbers).  The year prior saw almost 1bn *loss* for LinkedIn, and MSFT has said they've increased expenses since then.  Along with the $30bn MS paid for the company, it could be a long time before LinkedIn is a profit generator for MSFT, period.  Not to mention being the most profitable.

https://www.businessofapps.com/data/linkedin-statistics/#3Not really since MSFT reports Linkedin with Office under "Productivity and Business Processes" (and Azure, SQL, Gitlab, Consulting, and some other stuff all under "Intelligent Cloud"). Logically though, Productivity produces the most revenue, Linkedin has better margins than Azure, and until recently this year Linkedin was growing more consistently than Azure.Cloud might be beating it now, it's been benefitting while linkedin has been suffering from the pandemic. Until recently though Linkedin had great margins and their B2B solutions were basically mandatory for every company.Yeah I think every single person I saw posting today about being laid off were in sales or their blp programWhatsApp had 35 engineers and 450 million users when it was acquired by Facebook.You can argue about whether some of those jobs are essential, but one job that is essential creates a bunch of support jobs which in turn create their own support jobs.

This is why software is so expensive to develop. You are not just hiring 5 developers at 150k per. You are also hiring probably 5x that number at 100k per. Just to have a mobile app.I mean Linkedin is a very big application. It’s Facebook, Indeed, Glassdoor, analytics combined.Thanks for the “well actually...and I work at a big 4 so I know” comment.

Of course software has low per user costs, I’m not an idiot and not naively looking at anything.  Adding an incremental user at google is cheap, someone else paid the cost scale.  Go work at a startup, go from a few thousand to a few million and come back and tell me that incremental cost goes down.

Linked in for example wrote their own distributed message system Kafka)  because there was nothing off the shelf that handled what they needed to do.  That’s not the kind of thing you need to do at 100k users.

I cashed out my retirement in 2018 (it wasn't much but I just wanted to pay off some bills). I used to work as an actuary/data analyst.

I am pretty young in my career and have had a lot knowledge gaps either filled in by reddit or mentors (people I know and not some online guru that people call mentor).

I help people without college degrees find jobs. I'm the founder of https://www.NoDegree.com (I got super lucky with the domain) and host The NoDegree Podcast where I interview people without college degrees and have them share their stories. I just interviewed someone without a degree who works at Salesforce making VERY good money. He found me on LinkedIn. 

I also interviewed the CEO of Scribe Media. Someone on LinkedIn messaged me who messaged me before and was like I think he would be a good guest, want an intro? I will meet up with him when he comes to NYC. I am getting some amazing guests and have connected with some decent podcasters who also refer me guests.

I have had offers for funding before but I have a long term vision and I have sacrificed a decent amount of money in order to maintain my vision. LinkedIn has allowed me to be cash flow positive without worrying too much about chasing money. I don't want to sacrifice control to someone whose only focus is an exit or cashing out during a funding round.Google that exact question and you'll find a bunch of articles giving advice. It's a lot simpler than you thinkThat’s the literal definition of spam.They don’t just come across as spam, they are literally spam. They are the very definition of spam according to Google;

“irrelevant or unsolicited messages sent over the Internet, typically to a large number of users, for the purposes of advertising, phishing, spreading malware, etc.”>  they often come across as spam.

because they are spam.What was the profit? Revenue minus expenses. Because I refuse to believe they are not losing money with their billion employees after expenses.

1 billion loss sounds about right. Kind of funny I get downvoted to oblivion for questioning profit of tech meme company like LinkedIn.

Keep fomoing into tech stocks guys. It will work until it doesn't.Thanks. So they have never made a profit. Thanks for all the downvotes.U mean github not gitlab right?Office flucates between 25-50% of Microsoft's revenues.I am not sure that’s relevant. Whatsapp and Linkedin are two very different apps/platforms.

Edit: wordsand it had basically one functionality at the timeYou’re forgetting product managers, ux designers, ux researchers, data scientists, and content strategists. Oh and each section of the app has a team around it. It’s much more than 25 engineers for one mobile app.

Yeah if you ignore the whole part of the graph from 0-> 2 billion users, sure.  Now you have economies of scale on your existing functionality.  Software, unlike a car never finished.  Eventually, you're going to have to add something new.  Do you think it's more or less expensive to develop a new feature for 100k users versus 2 billion?

>I'm not sure if you have a point beyond "big companies spend lots.of money!".
>Henry Ford didn't spend vast sums pioneering modern production facilities to make his cars more expensive.

My whole argument is you spend more money to solve problems that other people solve with commodity solutions, i.e. your costs go up as your user counts go up.  Go look at the multiple opensource databases invented by Facebook alone.

Nobody's saying that you can print money with software.  The whole point of my original post was to help people who don't understand software understand why LinkedIn would need so many engineers to keep the lights on.It hasn't worked for me one single time when I decide to skip the tag. I get downvoted and then have to come back and add an edit. Poe's law is very strong.I feel you - unfortunately you can’t win on reddit.I mean... first off common sense...

Before this, we thought they'd be 1 shot, not 2. We thought there would be strong cd8+ response. We thought the neutralizing antibodies would be good.

It did prove safety. It did provide t cell responses and neutralizing antibodies.. But...

\- They need 2 shots not 1.

\- Their t cell responses were quite weak, and they weren't terribly specific about cd4 vs cd8. Total response was several times less than Moderna and  Pfizer. About a third of CanSino which is a similar platform, also, but harder to trust that data. Right know Pfizer looks best because of CD8+, and Moderna is good otherwise.

\- Their neutralizing antibodies while adequate were not higher than others, and lower in some cases.

\- They had a huge trial, around 500, but only boosted one group, and that's the group they are running with, and that group only had 10 subjects.

I think all of these vaccines will work for a while though. But this is not the strongest. They may just need a larger dose in addition to the boost (but that will increase negative events). Overall, this report was mediocre in the context of other vaccine candidates, but fine on its own.[deleted]Can anyone ELI5 why the stock price is down on AstraZeneca after this news?Missed the jump, but BNTX shows more promise in a vaccine currently. Shares jumped over 12% this morning alone.I can’t really explain why this moving considering this is better news than what moderna put out.

I’m wondering is Wall Street is waiting for their congressional testimony tomorrow.Ok, serious question. UK politicians said if the oxford vaccine is successful ppl in the UK will get it first. 

Now I understand the political pressure they face over that and on the flip side I understand the rational behind immunizing the most vulnerable first.

But the question I'm more interested in is if they could even effectively monopolize the supply of that drug even if they wanted to? Its likely to be produced in multiple countries at the same time. Didn't oxford sign a deal with a major Indian vaccine maker? Could India declare all those shots made domestically had to go to Indians first, nationalize the maker if needed?

Similar situation in where-ever its produced. Does Oxford effectively lose control of the vaccine distribution once seed samples are sent across the world for mass production?Feels like there's an article every other day about the vaccine saying pretty much the same thing. It's either successful or it isn't. They are milking this cowThis is a very positive development. Cannot wait to travel around the world again.I feel that atleast one third of my Portofolio are "gambles" on these covid19 stocks. Novavax, Moderna, Dynavax, AZ, Inovio, VBI Vaccines,... Atleast they are stable/breaking out lol.Not that the market isn't weird enough of late, but it's possible that we're heading into/already in a "good news is bad news" environment. In other words, a vaccine should be great news, because people will be safe, businesses can open up, and the economy can be back on track. But it also means the end of government spending, with a likely drawdown of the Fed's holdings, and that will put downward pressure on stocks, whereas continued problems means the money printer continues.Buy Oxford U stocks. Just joking.I am surprised this didn't pump the markets as much as the other vaccine news. who knew?Christ it was up 8 percent at one point and ended just over 1 percent up.We def need a vaccine for this virus....i hope it comes quickly!!It pushed to £96 LSE then fades..Live traders shorted $AZN as it was fallin smh.Think it's companies like IBIO which'd benefits by mass producing and not companies like Gild which developWe got the vaccine game played till the big boys suck and stick  it to retail mom pops

Pandemic globally getting worse and the Usa is the big violator as the corona Virus spreads like wildfire across the Usa its causing an economic depressionGlad I sold my AZN $56 call on FridayWhether or not [AstraZeneca's share price](https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en-gb/opto/will-astrazenecas-share-price-get-a-boost-from-coronavirus-vaccine-trials?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=investing) does drop slightly in the short-term, the pharmaceutical company remains a high-quality defensive stock. Over the past five years, it's up circa 112%, and carries a 2.47% forward dividend yield. 

Considering that the economic fallout from the outbreak could get worse before it gets better, AstraZeneca could provide any portfolio with a degree of resilience.People need to know that's there's no "vaccine" that will just make coronavirus go away, just like there's no "vaccine" for the common flu.

It will be like a seasonal flu shot. Just because you get the shot doesn't mean you won't get corona, it simply boosts your immunity to help you fight it.

This virus is here to stay.General question, with a string of positive phase 2 news from different vaccine candidates, is the probability of phase 3 trials being positive much higher? What are the risk factors of it being negative?

Reason I'm asking is that these news combined with new QE seemingly inevitable,  there doesn't seem to be much negative news that could reverse the current uptrend and the markets, forward looking is becoming more certain per se.

Hence increasing my likelihood of entering the market.Another Monday, another stock market vaccine pump.   *yawn*And then months later. They’ll start to foam at the mouth and seek darkness....soon it turn all people into zombies. IAMLEGEND.There will never be a vaccine. Antibodies go away after a few monthsI just wanna cry, i should close my computer and wait for tomorrow until eventually I recover my losses“Adrian Hill, director of Oxford’s Jenner Institute, told CNBC on Monday the strong immune response means the vaccine is more likely to provide protection against the virus, though nothing is guaranteed. He said scientists hope to begin human trials in the United States in a few weeks.”

Nothing is guaranteed. Yea, theyll probably have short term immunity, but the virus will never be over even with a vaccine. It will become seasonal and endemic, regardless if theres a vaccine or not. I wonder if the people in this study will have these antibodies for more than 6 months.

Also, the world is never going back to normal. Cope


https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.news-medical.net/amp/news/20200413/Novel-coronavirus-attacks-and-destroys-T-cells-just-like-HIV.aspxIt was priced in. People knew the announcement was going to be positive last week.https://www.barrons.com/articles/astrazenecas-covid-19-data-look-positive-but-doesnt-live-up-to-last-weeks-hype-51595260564

Overhyped last week is the sentimentThis is fine. Expected to drop before rising again. And options [flow going crazy](https://unusualwhales.com/alerts/2940f8f5-4c68-4d71-b689-c447b4c11562), despite initial dip of AZN.Booster is obviously not ideal, especially in the present situation when the quicker the manufacturing turnaround the better, but it isn't uncommon for vaccines to require boosters.

The booster group being only n = 10 pissed me off too.Thanks for the breakdown.Christ, people here will shit on everything lmao.Pfizer is hiring like CRAZY. A friend of mine just took a job at their plant in Sanford, NC. I haven't heard specifics (and I won't because NDAs), but the impression I get is very positive. This person has options, and if they went to Pfizer, it's because they feel Pfizer is going to win this horse race.Also none of this shows it can actually prevent someone from getting the coronavirus, right? I mean, that’s the whole point.Jesus christ, this always sunny clip perfectly encompasses the last 4 months:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zgk8UdV7GQ0&list=RDMZ1lc6KASWg&index=6I will never understand the rash of comments like this.  In a thread about positive vaccine results, all of the sudden it’s deflected to be about masks, then it’s about contact tracing, then it’s about OHHH MY GOD THE ECONOMY IS GOING IN THE SHITTER AND WERE ALL GOING TO DIE.

This is like...the worst conclusion possible from a story that is generally pretty positive.  Wtf is wrong with people?Not choose. You overestimate the Federal government's ability to be efficacious. It is not the best, or even a good, or even an adequate, response to most problems.

The most effective method for managing Covid thus far? Diligent use of masks, social distancing, hand hygiene, self-monitoring, and self-quarantining. All individual actions. In other words, if you have responsible adults involved, a government nanny program is unnecessary and doesn't help.

As it is, we're looking for one so they can step in and do at least a half-assed job where irresponsible aged children (it's amazing how many 30, 40, 50, 60+ yr old children there are in the world) have done a no-assed and/or intentionally destructive job.

In a just world we'd let these idiots catch the thing and take their chances, but as a cooperative species that seems a little too mean, so we deputize bureaucrats to do just bad enough of a job that nothing is expected of them in the future but not so bad that they lose their pension.Just getting it to more manageable levels ala the flu would be enough.[removed]Expectation was that this vaccine would work from leaks last week. People already bought knowing that. Details show it's good but not a cure-all.Buy the rumor sell the newsI too was expecting an aggressive hike in the stock price after the news.It too fell after opening.

Looks like some groups are getting out of the market considering all of the vaccine stocks fell.What? No it doesn't. Can you provide sources to your claim?There was a lot of smoke for days that Oxford was going to release positive news on their vaccine beginning either in the evening on Tuesday or Wednesday.

But yeah, depending on what that testimony is going to be about (I honestly don't know), that might fully explain the price action today.

EDIT: Okay, I see what tomorrow's testimony is going to be. May be interesting enough for me to give it a look too.This is equivalent to the news Moderna put out - both are that Phase 1 trials were passed. 

I would agree AstraZeneca is more likely to get a successful product to market first though, based on their resources, actual experience running large Phase 3 clinical trials (unlike Moderna, who is fighting with people over the process and clearly has minimal idea what they’re doing in this arena), and the fact that the vaccine method used is not completely novel (ie: we know this method is likely to be successful based on prior experience).Moderna sold off on the JPM upgrade. This report was excellent news for Moderna, but that overshadowed. Also, they still haven't shaken the 'pump and dump fraud' meme, even though it's not accurate.The deal signed between Oxford and AZ involves utilising AZs already global reach supply network to get the vaccine where its needed most as quickly as possible.

AZ have deals signed with various countries (including US and UK) but essentially they are aiming for 2 billion doses manufactured so the supply will be almost simultaneous across the world.

In terms of control of supply, that will be on AZ. They manage it daily with their 100 other medicines so, although this vaccine will present numbers an order of magnitude higher relative to AZs current medicines, they will be preparing all supply nodes to effectively supply this vaccine globally.Oxford does a substantial amount of work in the field of epidemiology and works closely with organizations like PATH or the Gates foundation for example. A lot of the research work they do isn't necessarily with a big profit motive in mind, though how materials and test results are managed after can depend on who is funding it. 

The plan they would have with distribution would probably be very different from one of the private biotechs working on their own vacchine e.g, Moderna

If Oxford is successful in getting to the finish line first with a vaccine they themselves are working on, I'd expect them to get it widely distributed for the lowest cost possible, or to even give out "seed samples" as you mentioned license-free so others can manufacture.

However this particular vaccine r&d work is funded by AstraZeneca which might affect how the results, if successful, are distributed. The statement of work might state that AstraZeneca owns everything at the end so they would have control of manufacturing/distro.They also took US money. It will be distributed to multiple countries simultaneously.>Ok, serious question. UK politicians said if the oxford vaccine is successful ppl in the UK will get it first.

UK politicians can say what they want, but the reality is that the US invested 1 Billion in this study so I doubt the IP is staying in the UK.I think it's more that the whole world is working on a vaccine right now and they're all at varying stages in the development process. It'd be more troubling if we didn't hear anything as often as we do tbh.[Across the world, about 160 coronavirus vaccines are in various stages of development](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oxford-astrazeneca-covid-vaccine-study-133927480.html). So yes there is going to be a lot of different news about vaccines.There's many different companies working on different vaccines. "It's either successful or it isn't" shows a ton of ignorance as to how clinical trials actual work. Things aren't binary like that in science.Are you perhaps mixing this with Moderna, who are claiming success while the directors casually offload their shares after every pump? Don't think we can throw all sources in the same bucketInvestors have been waiting for today’s announcement. Do you expect them not to report it?[removed]There are 3 phases. Data will be released at each. By the time we get to the end of phase 3, we'll already have known for sometime that success is likely imminent.Antibodies aren't needed to be always present for immunity, it's the memory B/T cells that matter, as they will produce antibodies rapidly as needed.

You really need to research before you make claims after reading headlines.Except this one's didn't.People bashing you by using correlates which may not even apply, we don't know yet.  We have never successfully created a coronavirus vaccine and have no idea what the immune response should be or how long it will be effective.At the start of that article you linked though there’s a retraction by the authorOr because people know they're producing the vaccine for free?That 90 million dose deal was priced in. But we still have a ways to go with this one.It was a lot of people selling off the news, especially options. I took it as an opportunity to add more shares to my rIRA, with the anticipation share price will steadily march up in the coming months/years as COVID is still relevant.It’s classic Wall Street. Buy on the rumor, sell on the news.Hilarious that if anything goes down it was priced in, how about it's all completely random? No one expected it to drop after the good news. Everything has been overvalued this is no exception.Generally, the concept of 'priced in' is imaginary. There is no statistical formula to price in anything unless there is insider trading. When someone says, 'priced in', I basically assume that person is a moron with an average or below average IQ.Yeah, strange they didn't anticipate that. I actually think they also need a bigger dose - less side effects, but weaker reactions... that is a dosing issue.

Boosting is fine, it was just hoped they wouldn't need to.Aren't we looking at monthly boosters though?I would take their vaccine or modernas today if offered.It's not a one team only wins race though. For the amount of doses required (billions) across the world, it would be naive to assume only one company will be the winner and have the supply chain set up to vaccinate people across the globe. Plus if you bring global politics into the mix, hardly a chance that countries outside of USA would not be developing their own vaccineNo.In the absolute, no, it doesn't prove it. But it probably does work.

Animal model had similar immune responses as humans, and held up fine when challenged with virus. That's very good. 

You also would find it VERY surprising to see some t-cell response and neutralizing antibodies that prevent viral infection in a test, and then have it not protect. They also ran the same test with blood from people who naturally got Covid and confirmed it stopped infection in lab samples - so same test.

So it probably does protect. It's not CERTAIN. But I think it's like 99%. IT could be it only protects for a short while though, like 6 months. But I think at least 1.5-2 years. 

Still worse than Moderna and Pfizer's vaccinesRob McElhenney needs to play [Trump Jr](https://i.imgur.com/2vHs8vu.jpg) in the Trump biopic that's no doubt in the works. The resemblance is uncannyLmao so trueI've been thinking about that clip a lot, it really is perfect for the timesA vaccine could be approved for use tomorrow and it would still take months for it to get distributed. Besides, headlines just like this one have been popping up for awhile now. The reality is that a vaccine is not going to be a miracle answer to COVID, it has to come from everyone doing their part. 

Sadly, judging by your posts, it's people just like you who have turned COVID into a bizarro political battleground that has led to a worsening of the situation in the US.> OHHH MY GOD THE ECONOMY IS GOING IN THE SHITTER AND WERE ALL GOING TO DIE

There are 40M unemployed Americans with millions more on the way unless we extend benefits. The economy is already in the shitter. The market is just simply not an accurate reflection of the economy.You are in r/investing where all bears go to sit on cash forever in anticipation of the always impending economic collapse because misery loves company.I read comments like the one above and come to the conclusion that the express purpose of social media platforms is to proliferate negative and/or extremist sentiment. 

Like it’s not just that the comment was made, but that it was well received too. People simply do not want to accept positive information, it is unreal.It's the doomer mentality. He probably lost a lot of money buying puts in the last few months too.It’s the rampant 🌈🐻 attitudeIf you have responsible adults involved.

Yeah. Good luck with that.

The reason why we need the government involved is because a very large number of adults are not being responsible or taking any if the steps you mentioned.Who hurt you?You really believe that? You really believe there is a some global conspiracy and everyone is working together, the scientists, politicians , companies, etc. ...to what end? And you are telling others to wake up?What...? It literally creates both T-body and antibody cells and all ~1,100 participants saw results. This by and large the best vaccine results we've seen.It opened at 91.75 and is currently at 89 and change, not really much of a drop considering the volatility. The company itself has many promising articles out this morning. Idk, I'm holding on for the ride.I'm literally just reading my position news this morning. They just agreed to supply the UK with 30 million doses... And theres more than just one positive article amidst all of the claims of other companies falling off. My shares have increased over $30/share since I purchased them.Ok I'll bite: what's tomorrow's 
congressional testimony about? Looked all over and nothing stood out. Mango related or vaccine related? Thxit's worse news than those because the results are worse than those. They passed, but it's not as good as the Pfizer or Moderna results.Yea and not all of these articles are “our vaccine will be successful”, they mostly just give insights to where their vaccine is in terms of trials and of course they want to release any positive news they haveYou’d think someone on an investing subreddit would understand executive compensation, and how they preschedule stock to sell at certain prices or at certain dates.The difference between this and Moderna is that the Moderna phase 1 got a lot better numbers on immune response.Your submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

Reinfection: https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.jpost.com/health-science/israeli-doctor-reinfected-with-coronavirus-3-months-after-recovering-635550/ampThat might be true for AZN, but it should have seemed at least slightly bullish for everything elseIt was because their data, while positive, does not appear as effective as the other large trials. Compare their vaccine + booster group to the convalescent plasma group. They were approximately equal. The other trials had titers that were higher than the convalescent plasma groups. 

Now, to be clear, these were different convalescent plasma groups so direct comparison isn't possible, but it is suggestive of a weaker response to the AZ/Oxford vaccine.It's disingenuous to think that the company that, so far, has the best shot at *saving the world* won't see dividends on their endLmao a company producing lead vaccines during a global pandemic doesn't get funded because people are worried they're going to supply it for free just like you're meant to do instead of finantially crippling everyone.

And we think we're going to Mars

GG humansOnly during the pandemic. After, they will raise the price.Free and not for profit are not the same thingAre you kidding? Nothing is ever free. Sure people might get it free but that just means government will pay for it.Priced in literally means the market had already decided on the fair value of a stock based on all the information available. This announcement was known last week hence why the news was priced in. Considering you're incapable of figuring out this simple phenomenon, I'd lay off attacking others intelligence if I were you lol.Yeah, if you think anything with the stock market requires a hard statistical formula to be valid, maybe you should lay off the whole advice thing?You wouldnt need monthly boosters indefinitely, I haven’t heard of a vaccine that works that way. You’d get the vaccine, and then a month later, the booster.Maybe once yearly. Or maybe you just need it twice or three times and are good. We don’t know yet.I dunno, Don Jr doesn't have anywhere near the level of mass cultivation of Mac.YES! I have 2 family members in biotech. Getting a vaccine is 1 milestone on a long, troublesome road forward towards a largely immunized public. I knew a guy who worked in pilot engineering in a generic pharma plant. They had a 10% scale version of the entire plant, basically. Their entire job was to produce test batches of drugs in a 10% scale plant to work out the kinks. This was a full time position employing multiple engineers for well understood chemical reactions to make generic drugs, drugs that had existed long enough for the patents to expire.

Discovering an effective vaccine isn't delivering it. It will take months to refine engineering processes and test the final products to ensure that what is being produced is safe to inject in people. That is an entirely separate and distinct problem than discovering a vaccine. A perfect vaccine will still have to manufactured in a real chemical plant, where cell cultures will have to be kept alive, mold will have to be kept from growing in pipes, and massive pieces of machinery will have to be calibrated. 

Drugs aren't microwave popcorn, the vaccine is going to take a long time to figure out how to manufacture after it is properly tested in human trials. I sure as shit am not injecting an "express lane" vaccine into my body. I'd rather wear a mask than risk chronic health problems from a vaccine that was discovered and launched inside of a year. These things have side effects too.Yep and its not like all vaccine manufacturors can just take the reciepe and begin producing it.  Each company manufactures vaccines differently.  While reaserchers are sharing information on the virus with their peers, which will speed up all other vaccines being developed, it will likely take until the end of 2021 to have enough vaccines developed for herd immunity.  Wearing a mask is not political but when you have a toddler running the country who thrives by being decisive and contradictory, this is what you get.https://youtu.be/y59g54hC-aY

Did you read the second half of the post?Seems like that was kind of the intent of his comment. 

The other side being that a government response isn't really an effective workaround, but just maybe /possibly slightly better than nothing.finance : sociopaths :: flame : mothsDon't hate on real talk.Not trying to be a dick, but only 543 people got the Covid vaccine and more people had local/systemic reactions than the existing vaccine the other 500 got. It was early phase and a lot of vaccines fail during development. I hope and expect this to be a good one, but your man asked why the stock hadn't gone to the moon and I tried to offer an explanation.[removed]Yes, but does so adequately, but poorly compared to the other vaccines. And it needs to be boosted, and we didn't think that before.Yep just let the bears get out of the marketWait... you're equating the trajectory of a stock with the efficacy of a vaccine.... ?

Are you tarded?

Oxford has promised hundreds of millions of doses around the world. [400 million of which is promised to Europe.](https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/astrazeneca-to-supply-europe-with-up-to-400-million-doses-of-oxford-universitys-vaccine-at-no-profit.html)

They can’t say anything more than what the data tells them. This is why we have a phased, gated approach.What difference the 'prescheduling' is suppose to make? If the stock is at $65 and they preshedule to sell x% at $80 - then release positive news, achieve their target price and cash out, that's the same as 'deciding' to sell at $80. The point is that if they prefer cash to holding the stock, but are telling the public the company is on the verge of something massive, you should be wary of a conflict of interest thereYou can literally read the study they published today before just spewing shit you don't understand.

https://marlin-prod.literatumonline.com/pb-assets/Lancet/pdfs/S0140673620316044.pdfConvalescent plasma is for severe cases, not prevention.But those are two different treatments, the plasma is more of a cure whereas this is a preventative measure.Honestly still plenty of profit to be had after that, doubt this thing will be able to be completely vaccinated out of society, well prolly just have random outbreaks still in some places.Moron.Moron.the Tetanus vaccine needs to be re administered regularly to continue to provide protection.That's because 'vaccines' with such a short timeframe for efficacy are abandoned rather than brought to market.Yep, unknown.

Do you not like accountability for your tax bill or something?

How would that work in a private transaction, like if you paid an HVAC guy to install a new furnace and he just left the job half done, or ended up getting it done at 3x the original bid?

You people have thinking problems.When someone says "real talk", you know they have no clue what they are talking about.I'm having trouble understanding your first sentence. 543 took the Covid vaccine because it was a blind test -- that's how science works lol All 543 saw results. All reactions were mild/moderate -- nothing that will write off this vaccine.

I was responding to the guy that said this isn't a cure-all. This is far and wide the best vaccine results we've seen this far. Especially considering they have the largest populations of any other tests out.Your submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

We have a government that [can't figure out a functional healthcare system](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/quality-u-s-healthcare-system-compare-countries/#item-crude-rate-per-100000-hospital-discharges-for-post-operative-sepsis-after-abdominal-surgery-ages-15-and-older-2016-or-nearest-year), has the [exact same problem with the public schools](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/07/us-education-spending-finland-south-korea), and has an [ever increasing welfare bill](https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/CRS%20Report%20-%20Welfare%20Spending%20The%20Largest%20Item%20In%20The%20Federal%20Budget.pdf) that manages to [hold the poverty rate constant at best](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_the_United_States#/media/File:Number_in_Poverty_and_Poverty_Rate,_1959_to_2017.png).

The Federal government does not solve problems very often, especially not problems of personal responsibility. It's a convenience - a society's chosen way of managing certain truly collective concerns, like relationships between the states, mutual defense, and relations with other nations.

It does not get much better (maybe a little) at the local level, where we cannot [figure out how to make a municipal subway system work](https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/06/mass-transit-conservatives-hong-kong-free-market-united-states-bureaucracy/) despite experiments in many different cities.

Your dumbshit reply is simply a way of trying to discredit an argument without actually having to make any points. So either present a cogent counterargument or butt out.Only that you said 1100 saw results, which is true but only 543 were relevant to if the *Covid* vacc works.

I'm that guy. Best so far, yes. No argument there.Great questions.

Moderna had both, and at higher levels. Dramatically higher neutralizing, and about 3x the T-cell response.

Inovio had both, and at higher levels.

Pfizer had both, and at higher levels.

NVAX animal model had both, and at higher levels.

I think this vaccine is just under-dosed honestly. Matches their low side effects.

**Large population size:**

This vaccine is moving forward on prime+ boost. Their sample for that is 10 people. All other vaccines had larger phase 1 samples for the dose they are moving forward with into phase 2 and phase 3. So actually, this vaccine had the smallest population of any phase 1, with regards to the actual dosing that will be used in phase 2/3. They will extract safety info from the 500 people. But, the actual dose protocol they are using only got tested on 10 people, and their single dose protocol creates lackluster immunity that may fade in 6 months or less. That's why they are dropping it. 

**Prior Research:**

All of the other active in phase 1+ vaccines are built on prior platforms, some of which haven't shipped drugs yet, but all of which had prior work. That's why they are this far in. And, they are all using prior SARS vaccine research to avoid pitfalls, which is why everyone is targeting the spike protein (RBD specifically), and not the N protein or other proteins.I was merely offering insight on a stock I own in the same field as the one that was posted in this thread originally. Pfizer and BioNTech have been fast tracked and I have seen nothing but positive results since I have purchased the stock.Your claim was that BTNX had a better vaccine. You've literally provided nothing to back that claim outside of the stock performing better - which is, objectively, stupid.

[AstraZeneca is already in production with plans to start hitting market by Sept/Oct.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/04/astrazeneca-is-set-to-make-two-billion-doses-of-a-coronavirus-vaccine.html)AstraZeneca isn't making money off making the vaccine.

But more importantly - I'm literally providing you a study from the literal most renowned university in the ENTIRE WORLD. 

How fragile is your ego that you think you're smarter than fucking **Oxford scientists** as they're publishing their successful results?Your right. I read your statement wrong. I apologise.

Edit: and I can't spell today, apologize.I am. Are you *understanding* them? Clearly not.The same people that say that government doesn't work are the same people, through either ignorance in being incapable of governance or malice as it supports their argument, who get elected to screw up said government and then point back to it saying government doesn't work.All of the vaccine trials you listed had an incredibly small population size. Some are less than 1/10 of Oxford's. 

Moderna is trying to use a controversial mRNA vaccine that has never been successfully adapted on the scale they're attempting.

Inovio is literally taken with a booster.

Pfizer has yet to publish anything, though I do have faith in them.

I'm not even going to begin to comment on how rtarded it is to try and compare animal models to human models.


On large population size, you are doing some serious mental gymnastics to think that the initial dosage isn't an integral part to this vaccine. You're literally discounting 500+ individuals who took the vaccine, the undeniable efficacy of the vaccine in those individuals, AND the data it provided. The single dose protocol showed the strongest immunity of any of the other vaccines. The 6 months or less comment can be made about ANY vaccine, except Oxford is literally the only one with the vast amount of information that they do. 

I'm gonna need sources on your "all using prior research" claim.I never once said they had a better vaccine, pull your head out of your ass. I just said they were still performing well in the market. Are you even reading what I'm writing?I think the idea of a “vaccine” goes against the fact that you cannot verify immunity using antibodies like the WHO said. If you could, why are people reporting being re-infected and having worse symptoms the second time around?So he said something along the lines of ‘sociopaths are drawn to finance like moths to a flame’, and you replied ‘there’s nothing sociopathic about pointing out the government is bad at things’.  And you think I’m the one with the misunderstanding?  

Actually your correct, but only to the point that your response makes no sense.I have to disagree with you, because there are plenty of legitimate examples of government efficacy when the *problem is correctly matched to the responsible party*.

You cannot make an interstate highway system or build and maintain a global navy at a carrying capacity less that of an economically developed major power nation. Carbon County, WY, cannot put an army that matters together and neither can Cameroon.

Those problems, the Federal government is quite good at. International relations, Federal courts for deciding matters truly outside the purview of the states, etc.

Where you get into problems is when you expect a Federal program to solve the same problem for a Liberal living in Mississippi and a Conservative living in California when those problems have completely different etiologies and exist in completely different contexts. It's an unrealistic expectation, it is doomed to fail, and it is why people who truly care about outcomes would be better served looking at *other options* to address life's specific, individualized challenges (like health and education, which are highly variable per-person, for example).Go look at the neutralizing antibody levels of this  vaccine - lower than convalescent until boosted, then same. Ino, Moderna, Pfizer all higher. 

Go look at the T cell response in appendix. .04% unboosted and .06% boosted. Literately all of the other vaccines have higher, usually 2-3x. You can google those papers and see for yourself easily. Also, the pharma press was chattering about how lackluster the results were today, and the stock price moved along with that. 

Sure it’s safe. It’s also not that effective compared to the others. And the others look safe so far. Moderna is clearing phase 2 into 3 as an example this week. 

Pfizer put a final results preprint up online today. It’s a lot better than AZN’s product. 

I’m not going to spend hours citing all the science the other vaccine companies are standing on. It’s intuitive they couldn’t be here this fast and getting these numbers without prior science. They had ready to go platforms.> BNTX shows more promise in a vaccine currently.

Verbatim, your words. You fuckin moron. Is English not your first language?Again, if you spend 15 minutes reading the fucking article it goes into *detail* about how they verified immunity.

You're not smarter than Oxford because you read one WHO article 2 months ago. Get over yourself.So you would verify it by measuring IFN-y titers to measure t-cell response...

Which is what they did? How much do you know about immunology? It feels like you don’t even know what you’re saying when you start quoting the WHO.His implication is that the content of my OP is sociopathic.As a counter to that, you can't expect local government to address a nationwide issue that relies on cooperation and a standard, reasonably well understood method of addressing a threat like a pandemic.I already addressed your notes on INO & Moderna. INO only works in conjunction with a booster, so that's a moot point. AND so did Pfizer's. Moderna is trying to use a vaccine that has never worked on the scale they're attempting. Meaning this has failed, time and time again.

Pharma press has heralding these results -- where do you see otherwise? T cells aren't the only implication of this. It had significant antibody response and, again, the reason this is the most promising because of how robust the testing is AND how successful it is without any significant side effects.

>Sure it’s safe. It’s also not that effective compared to the others.

I'm not sure you understand how administering vaccines to the entire world works. Safety comes first, full stop. That's why there are so many different companies trying this. Every single company you've cited has had less than 1/10 of the population size that Oxford had.

>It’s intuitive they couldn’t be here this fast and getting these numbers without prior science. They had ready to go platforms.

You're now guessing. A pharma company has every incentive in the world to hard push a vaccine that could potentially save the world. Unless you can cite sources then this is pure conjecture.

[Andrew Pollard in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISIt0pC5Vio&t=436s) speaks about the years of data they have at their disposal.

Pfizer's did not have better than AZN.

>[All subjects in the prime-boost cohorts, except for two at the lowest dose level, had CD4+ T cell responses.](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-early-positive-update-german)

That's 16% of the group that took that dosage that didn't have T cell responses meanwhile ALL of AZN's did. AND Pfizer only tested this dosage on **12** people. Are you starting to understand why a larger population's results should be weighted more heavily?

Finally, equating stock performance to the efficacy of a vaccine is fucking stupid and you know it. Did you just start trading?Yeah, the company shows promise of rolling their vaccine out, amidst other companies dropping out of the race, that doesn't equate to btnx's vaccine itself being better? Comprehension is everything my friend, don't put words in my mouth and then try to argur with me about a point i never made.“Adrian Hill, director of Oxford’s Jenner Institute, told CNBC on Monday the strong immune response means the vaccine is more likely to provide protection against the virus, though nothing is guaranteed. He said scientists hope to begin human trials in the United States in a few weeks.”

Nothing is guaranteed. Yea, theyll probably have short term immunity, but the virus will never be over even with a vaccine. It will become seasonal and endemic, regardless if theres a vaccine or not. I wonder if the people in this study will have these antibodies for more than 6 months.

Also, the world is never going back to normal. Cope


https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.news-medical.net/amp/news/20200413/Novel-coronavirus-attacks-and-destroys-T-cells-just-like-HIV.aspxWhat, like the Georgia state government addressing New Jersey's Covid response? No, that is silly.

Equally silly is the supposition that a Federal response to Covid is the best approach. Georgia and New Jersey have different cultures and demographics and different needs, and cajoling compliance with best practices out of Georgians is not something that is going to be very easy or effective for the kind of people that actively want to live in Washington D.C. and be Federal employees.

Ultimately, regardless of what anyone thinks, the people of the US are responding to this pandemic individually and are going to do so as they individually see fit. That's probably for the best. Times like these have a persnickety habit of allowing emergency measures to become permanent, witness the PATRIOT Act, President's emergency war power, etc.You aren't going to engage in an intellectually honest debate, so I'm done. Backed into a corner, you are relying on a populist "safety first" argument, and sidestepping the actual substantive issues. The data is out there in clear form, you just have to look at the journal entries. I'm not going to debate 1+1=3 with you. It's in plain view to compare. Statnews reporters threw a ton of cold water on this, as did derek lowe today. You can go read and compare yourself, it's not hard, and the story is consistent. The vaccine is mediocre.  Good luck.This entire thread is on Oxford/AstraZeneca and your words are "BNTX shows more promise in a vaccine currently."

This is a direct comparison with Oxford/AstraZeneca and BNTX which is, objectively, fucking stupid.

Did you go to school? lmao Why do I have to teach you how to speak? Is it your down syndrome?In the same breath that you say AZN/Oxford is lieing to defraud their investors, **you are now quoting them.**

This vaccine will be the vaccine that saves the world, mark my words. Whether that means you have to take it seasonally completely misses the point. We take a booster flu shot every year, but to act like this vaccine isn't going to have massive impacts is disingenuous *at best*. 

Simply put, you're too fragile to admit you're wrong so you're desperately trying to save face.Completely agree on emergency measures becoming permanent, though that tends to happen when there is money to be made and little required from the public aside from ignorance. 

I would (generously) assume you are intentionally misunderstanding the idea of one local government trying to handle the response of another local to confuse the idea, or be funny, hard to say which, but a pandemic is practically exactly in line with the examples you gave where a county in Colorado can’t create an effective army, you can’t manage a pandemic with thousands of individual responses.  Especially in cases like this, a calm, rational leadership structure, and calm, rational preventative measures like distancing and clear quarantine guidelines would have worked perfectly...it could even have worked within your structure of local control where any locale could chose to ignore national policy completely, and they would just be subject to restrictions on travel to other areas.

The idea that any kind of reasonable response could happen at some kind of county level, across 1000s of counties is ridiculous...just think what it would look like if we didn’t have at least some place like the cdc to aggregate data and provide the recommendations they do, even hampered by mistrust of science at higher levels.  

I can only assume you are being disingenuous, or ignorant in your arguments to understand how you would argue that management and guidance of a global pandemic is a bad example of what we would expect from a federal government.  I mean obviously there are specifics that need to be handled differently in New Jersey than rural North Dakota, but there are enough similarities that overall structure could be handled at a higher level...I mean it’s not like symptoms and precautions in NJ are significantly different than ND, even if the details need to be tweaked to accommodate population density and distribution of population and supplies, etc.  this every state for themselves is a product of your thinking, not a goal to be achieved or maintained.I was with you up until the point you essentially claimed that elected science-deniers would make the best decisions for their individual communities.You're literally wrong because you're comparing pfizer's preprint T-cell data with data that Oxford didn't put on their publication. You're literally fabricating arguments.

We'll find out in just a few months. RemindMe!6 monthsNah ive just accepted the fall of our degenerate society. Have fun when the ADE makes CoronaChan even more fun the second time you get it. Cope

Edit: you compare it to getting a booster shot for the flu, guess its “just a flu” amirite?> hard to say which

It was clearly a facetious comment, but also an extreme to illustrate the point.

> a county in Colorado can’t create an effective army, 

Luckily, this is not necessary; We already have a healthcare system nationwide and already tuned and adapted to their individual locales.

> you can’t manage a pandemic with thousands of individual responses.

You have no choice but to literally manage it with hundreds of millions of individual responses - about 330 million or so as of the last census. Each person's actions are their own mangement and response.

> calm, rational preventative measures like distancing and clear quarantine guidelines would have worked perfectly

This is the point of my original post. Appropriate individual action would have negated the need for *any* governmental response at any level.

> but there are enough similarities that overall structure could be handled at a higher level

On paper, yes. In practical reality: No.

> I can only assume you are being disingenuous, or ignorant in your arguments to understand how you would argue that management and guidance of a global pandemic is a bad example of what we would expect from a federal government.

Then stop assuming.

People also assume the Feds could do better on health care and public schools. They are incorrect, because the problems in those arenas do not wholly arise from Federal policy. It is folly to expect uniform equivalence in results across a country as large and diverse as this one.

> this every state for themselves is a product of your thinking, not a goal to be achieved or maintained.

Incorrect. There have been [definitive examples](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/05/coronavirus-crisis-ron-desantis-florida-covid-19-strategy/) of the benefits of a Federalism approach in the Covid-19 issue specifically.

Believing that the Federal approach comes first is fundamentally misunderstanding the founding premise of the United States' structure, which is intended to be, from highest on the totem pole to lowest, Individual/Local Government --> State Government --> Federal Government. The whole theory of limited government was based on the foundational truth that responsible, self-reliant adults don't need a heavily government to live healthy and functional lives.

This is why the original post then circles back to the one justification for Government involvement: Irresponsible dependent aged children, to wit: 40something 5G conspiracy theorist jackasses.'Best' does not mean 'the same decision you would make'. 

People value different things. Clearly there's a contingent of the US that values individual rights over disease risk. You can decide for yourself how you feel about that, but trying to impose your particular preferences on them from afar will get you nowhere.

Better to let them cluster together and make dubious decisions in a more knowable, defined region (or group of them, as the case may be).Oxford put T cell on their report in the appendix. 0.06% total response at 56 days with boost. Minuscule. Maybe adequate. Maybe random error and actually better with more people. But very low compared to others. After they spent a Bloomberg interview hyping their T cell responses as unique. No credibility.There is a 24 hour delay fetching comments.

|-|-|-|-|Lmfao. Neck beard confirmed.Ok, I think I’m coming to the conclusion that we’re arguing the same thing from different directions, but it’s kind of hard to tell the way you pull a sentence than then respond with a paragraph.  I don’t think the federal government can come in and manage each locale (effectively or ineffectively), but there isn’t even a concept of individuals managing this individually...we all rely on outside sources of information and guidance and currently that is basically the media and then each level of government cumulatively.  What I’m saying is that a consistent, science based federal response would be light years more effective than 1000s of local responses in the same way that a federal army is more effective than a bunch of local militia, and in the same way lots of local militia would be ideal in a different type of situation.  A global pandemic is a reasonable situation in which to call up some federal assistance and guidance.  Sure they can be wrong and need to adjust to new data, but the only way local government would be better is if a centralized set of accepted guidelines were so far off that everyone died by following them.

I assume we could argue this all day, and honestly I wouldn’t be totally against that, but it’s exhausting jumping around a dozen different points, so if would cold focus on one or at least a couple, I’d be more than willing to continue the discussion, and maybe even make more sense doing so.  For instance, arguing if the cdc has the right guidelines is related, but different than whether all the states should follow a central authority on the matter.The text of the paper says that induced T cell levels peaked at Day 14 and were maintained out to at least Day 56, with no real effect of a booster in that case. There are no actual data presented, and there’s nothing on CD4+ cells versus CD8+ ones.

Again, you're fabricating arguments.

edit:

It's also fucking stupid to discount a "safety first" argument when talking about a virus that has over 150 different vaccines in the race. Safety is paramount with a vaccine that will go around the entire globe.Safety is pass fail. they are all passing. You are being dramatic and intellectually dishonest in raising it a severe issue in the context of this argument.

You are right, it peaks day 14. let's compare. Spoiler: you are completely wrong that their responses were superior.

**Boost AZN total t-cells:**

*Day 7/14/28/35/56 total t cells: 258/1642/528/445/614 (per million) --> .026% / .16%/.05%/.04%/.06%*

**Boosted Moderna total t-cells: (they didn't provide raw #, eyeballing on graph)**

Day 1/29/43 cd4+ 100ug to s1: \~0%/.06%/.2%

Day 1/29/43 cd4+ 100ug to s2: \~0%/.06%/.23%

(union of these is probably slightly higher, so call it 0%/.07%/.25%

Day 1/29/43 Cd8+ 100ug to s1: \~0%/.01%/.035%

Day 1/29/43 Cd8+ 100ug to s2: \~0%/.01%/.02%

Union maybe 0/.01/.04%

*Total is day 1/29/43 0%/.08%/.27%.* That appears about 5x higher than AZN if you forecast a day 43, which is the relevant comparison for longer term. Because .27% is a lot more than .06%. Maybe you'll argue that point.

**Then there's Pfizers:**  [https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.20140533v1](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.20140533v1)

30ug is the dose they are using. It's a little hard to read their charts too, but they are showing day 29.

cd4+: \~ .08%

Cd8+: \~.05%

*Total at day 29: .13%.* Also greater than .05% benchmark for the same on AZn. .13%>.05%.

I may have eyeballed these wrong, but it's such a large gap, it doesn't' matter if I did.

Here's Derek Lowe making a similar argument - that the vaccine is lackluster, overhyped, and worse than PFE and MRNA:

[https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/07/20/new-data-on-the-oxford-az-vaccine](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/07/20/new-data-on-the-oxford-az-vaccine)

You can go do the rest. I guess I lied when I said I wouldn't try to disprove your statement that 1+1=3.It is a severe issue when half of Americans cited safety as the major drawback from taking the vaccine.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWwJPe7p2A&feature=emb_title

Hope you listened to this today dumbass. Straight from the mouths of Moderna/Pfizer/etc. they ALL require 2 shots LOL

Dude, there’s a reason why going into larger real world studies fails so many vaccines. When you test such a small population the relative risk of it failing when trying to apply it to a larger population is significantly higher than that of a vaccine whose initially has large testing populations. That’s an irrefutable fact and the notion that you can’t get past that is insane. ESPECIALLY when we're seeing disparities among minorities. AstraZeneca is literally the only company that is testing in the UK, South Africa, Brazil AND the US.

Where do you see the data for AZN?

Yeah, did you read what I wrote before about how **16% DID NOT** get the T cells from Pfizer’s?

Finally, on your t cell point:

T cell production is trained early on in the infection, and the context of that early training is intentionally controlled in this vaccine, so the lack of increased T cell response following secondary administration likely just means that the dynamics didn't adjust because the cellular response produced by the initial administration was appropriately adaptive. If the T cell response had increased following secondary administration, that would mean the cellular immune response dynamics were changing in the presence of antibodies, which could be undesirable. So this is likely good and expected news.

TL:DR more t cells =/= a better vaccine

edit: 

A major problem one of the congressman just announced was that 72% of pharma companies obtain their materials internationally, some estimates up to 150 different countries. AstraZeneca is the ONLY ONE that both sources ALL of their ingredients from the US **AND** manufactures there.You shift the debate and raise peripheral other issues every time you enter in it. Just admit you are wrong and move on. I've explained this from way too many dimensions - experts, data, etc. You aren't listening and you are not learning. Good luck on your trades.I can palpably touch the irony in this post. You're wrong, fool. AstraZeneca/Oxford's vaccine will be THE vaccine. Listen to the congressional hearing today. You're intentionally missing my points and you keep doubling down on "wElL iT hAd MoRe T ceLlS" -- you lack any scientific knowledge and it shows.Hahahahaha, can't believe i missed this the first time i watched the congressional hearing. **Moderna has never successfully brought a vaccine to the market.****Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

&#x200B;

1) AMD will get pumped hard until earnings

2) It will beat top and bottom but will dump, similar to microsoft.  This is our environment right now.Who remembers the days when AMD was the one dropping the ball like this at every turn? My oh my how the tables have turned. It’s pretty incredible.Intel is still viable but be aware that they (and this has been reported before) are essentially milking a product line from like 2015 (ish) at this point in terms of architecture and node size. Honestly they have no one to blame but themselves, but in case there are any actual longterm investors here - be aware that this problem has been boiling for years and the fallout is likely to be huge unless AMD fumbles at the 2-yard line or intel throws about 3 Hail Mary's.Yes, AMD is kicking ass and taking names right now.  I started buying shares when they were around $13.  And I'll be buying more since I think there's still plenty of room for it to grow.  

But, if you own Intel, don't sell.  Intel and AMD are like Ford and Chevy.  One will be top dog for a while until the other comes out with a new innovation and takes the lead.  Then in time it'll reverse again.  And again.  I'm an AMD fan, but I highly doubt Intel will stay behind forever.  I'm betting they're in a more competitive position 5 years from now and that those who bought AMD while holding Intel are going to be the real winners.70b vs 6b yearly revnue lmaoBoth NVIDIA and AMD have great leadership, Intel does not, hence their troubleIntel has the smartest minds in the business, they've been through worse times and they'll deliver.

And AMD will be the king for the next 4 years for sure, maybe even longer.Would Intel warrant a re rating if they instead outsourced their next 7nm cpu? They should have the 10 nm ready to go by end year and they could very well have their 7nm going next year should they have TSM or Samsung produce it. Or would it take longer for them to get on the waitlist?Lets not forget the both the Xbox series X and Playstation 5 are both using AMD processors.And I was downvoted for calling Intel the next IBM ...

AMD will profit from this, but who is building AMD’s 7nm chips? And who is building Apple’s chips when they transition away from Intel? Who is getting subsidized by every western government that fears China? TSMC to the moon.Can anyone please explain why AMD is considered a meme stock?A nice time to long INTC IMO. Yes, next gen chips are delayed however, fundamentals remain strong, plus  a nice dividend. Intel has such a huge amount of capital available to get through the slump short term. Took a small starter position after hours.Are you just gonna ignore TSMC?This happened back in the early 2000s with the Athlon XP. I expect Intel will recover.

There was a time back around then that people were worried about Nvidia because the GeForce FX was a major stinker.

They turned out ok.

Edit: Fanboys bein salty.~~What? AMD was down by 3.58% yesterday.~~

Edit: Oh sh\*\*.. after hours. Damn, I sold my AMD shares yesterdaySold my position in the 40s and low 50s, had bought in on average at $13

Stock is now way ahead of itself IMOSomehow I managed to buy right at the lowest point during trading hours and checked back around an hour later pleasantly surprised to see +5%. Only regret is not buying more.Intel must have some of the worst management in the business. Right up there with AT&T.Are there any contracts that are something like AMD/Intel stock price. I want to bet that intel will go down compared to AMD.Honestly this is a great buy the dip for Intel. Yeh they're delaying the chip release, but they still beat on earnings. Still a solid company.Maybe an unpopular opinion but... 

I don't consider AMD a meme stock. They have solid leadership and growing market share. Additionally, they're heavily invested in R&D (aka innovation), and are profitable. What's meme-ish about that? Looks like a pretty solid company to me.

Edit 1: At the time of writing this, they're up $9+. So...idk, the market is wonky this year. LolI just want to say thanks to this forum. I decided to buy AMD over Intel a while back based on everyone’s analysis of the companies. I’ll be holding AMD for a longtime and I’ll be buying more, but it’ll be paying for dinner tonight! $$They also just announced that they are considering outsourcing manufacturing. With their recent history om not surprised, 10nm was massively delayed and is only now starting to enter mass production, 3 years after schedule. And even then not in any big chips as their yield is too bad. And now 7nm delays, how long until they go fabless? It used to be unthinkable thst Intel of all companies would go fabless, but now its not that far off.

I dont understand why Intel havent tried to make a new architecture as they have problems with their node shrink, a new architecture seems like the best way to increase preformance, but instead we have been on skylake for 4 years. With extremely incremental improvment to clockspeed and ipc due to a maturing 14nm process node.

The only think keeping Intel up has been that amd was so far behind, but now amds zen 2 is almost equal to Intels skylake in terms of singel core preformance. I give Intel 2 more generations to make either their 7nm work or being a new architecture to market until amd is far ahead of them. Of course Intel has already lost in multi core.

Now i Kinda expected that this was going to eventually happen after intel announced that they were outsourcing some low end chipsets to tsmc a year back, that combine with amds increased market share and apple leaving Intel for arm, TSMC is going to get a lot more buisniss, at least untill a few years down the line when apple starts their own fabs. That being said im buying $TSM and $AMD.

Also, AMD $69, niceCool! Intel dropped 10%+

It just means I bought more Intel.Bought puts at $61 today. Wish me luck.Intel's management must have some backwards priorities. Seems like they haven't been able to innovate or even just coast for the last 5 years.I am one of the suckers who bought into their 10th generation chips and barely got any performance gains lol\-17% now for INTC. wish i had free cash right now to get it, that's a steal.Analysts at Piper Sandler: "  Intel is now targeting the end of 2022/early 2023 for its 7nm technology. AMD is already on 7nm with most of its chipsets, and the company is talking about moving to 5nm in the next generation, which we think will be next year. Overall, we believe the Intel delays could have a strong positive impact on AMD's market share. With Intel struggling to get to 7nm, the company may have to outsource to a foundry. If that were to happen in roughly another year or so, both would outsource leading edge technology. In our view, AMD could move much closer to a 50/50 market share split (or even higher) versus our current thinking of maybe 35% at best."In this environment:

Me today: I knew holding my AMD stocks would pay off!

Me in two days i think: AMD has crashed! I should have SOLD!!!What they need to do is offer us a bowl of Tostito's With a Hint of Lime.Honestly go and read intel annual reports a few years back.. they keep promising that they are about to catch up etc etc...

They never do, and it is only getting worse, I bought Intel in the past, I wouldn't get even close to those shares again.Let’s also not forget that it powers the PS5 and recently Sony had to add 50% more to production to keep up with demand, bought 4 shares yesterday and wish I bought 6 lolI got baby amounts of stock rn and it was nice after losing $67 in a day to all of a sudden being up $117 or something.intel is def a buy today, back the truck upI'm happy I sold AMD at 60.  I have 30 years of AMD/ATI letting me down with terrible products, I don't know what I was thinking buying the stock.

I made a few dollars on it.  Even if it goes up, I'm glad I'm out.Welp,  glad I bought calls this morning I guessBoom!Does anybody here think it’s possible that it’s because of coronavirus? I mean designing and manufacturing chips has to be extremely hands-on.Intel seems to be the living embodiment of the adage "get woke go broke" https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bui7gp/the_past_few_years_of_intel_finally_make_sense/

See also the comparison of the 'woke' ETFs SHE and PXWIX versus say market index VTI. Huge underperformance by "gender woke" companies. There were studies suggesting these companies did well, but it seems to be a different story when you put money on the line. 'Tis often so.wow amazingly for some mysterious reason I open 1000 put contracts on INTC expiring tomorrow and 1000 call contracts on AMD expiring tomorrow    😋  I'm so amazingDoesn't matter, intel still makes better chips than AMD. The only reason AMD price started going up is because of the crypto boom where people started buying video cards. No person in their right mind would build an AMD processor pc over an intel processor.Seems tempting to load up on AMD calls and sell them just before earnings.Doesn't that happen to AMD every time?Beat analyst expectation, miss market expectationsWould you say Intel is a smart buy since it dropped \~10% or is that stock doomedThat's what most people think it'll do now which means that it won't do that.Agreed, I have been watching (and trading) AMD for about 5 years. It consistently rises until earnings then a massive sell off no matter the news reported. I recommend that you do not hold thru earnings.So if you know what will happen, why are you not making unlimited money from this knowledge?  Isn't that the entire point?Yeah im new to stocks but im sensing from what ive gathered so far, in this market it seems like people are just putting a bunch of money into stuff thats going up, selling, taking a profit and watching it crash on like a daily cycle.When was their last dump?  After last earnings?It also happened in the early to mid 2000’s. AMD kicked intel’s ass for a while. History will repeat itself as Intel returns with a revolutionary product like the Duo and Quad cores were.It really is.  Intel had such a massive lead on fabs and a far better processor design for years (bulldozer was AMD's NetBurst) and completely blown that lead by failing to get their 10nm process to work well.  Don't get me wrong Zen is a way better architecture than what AMD was putting out before but this entire recovery in AMD's share price has pretty much exclusively been driven by Intel screwing up for years here to a borderline unfathomable extent.how the turntables....I literally learned about GPUs in the past month. Sad I didn't get to witness  this hahaIntel has been spending more on R&D than Nvidia has been generating in revenue. What you said is more or less what everyone else thinks, but there is way more to Intel then semiconductorsThe market was hoping that the 10nm fumble is over and that the company has found its aggressive pace again, but now we discover that the issues that caused the 10nm fumble might still be there on 7nm, which could indicate a long term slump in Intel's technical abilities. That's not a good sign, but Intel will always find a way back in this field, it's just too big with loads of resources. The question is how long will that take and how patient investors are willing to be. I think a lot of investors will be wary, but also a lot that believe in the company. The stock will take a hit for a few years, so if you're a long term investor, maybe not a terrible idea to buy over the next couple of years?I inherited a few thousand in stocks all in intel... clearly not a good time to sell and I don’t typically invest in single stocks. What should I do?I guess the argument against this is Intel high performance gaming skus for laptops takes a big leap with tgl H less than a year from now and then shortly after that another leap where they likely gain performance lead once again (they still lead in single task but won't regain multi task lead until Alder lake). I guess what I'm saying is Intel is near the end of milking their roadmap and are still breaking revenue records.That's exactly why its funny how AMD can produce tech which Intel are dreaming about.Yeah, nvidia and amd are lead by former engineers, they know what they are doing, know the semi conductor space. Intel is lead by some random buisniss man.At one point, Intel had the best leadership (Andy Grove)Seems like their family is good at that, because Nvidia's CEO and AMD's CEO are related to eachother, uncle and neiceIntel has also bean counters running the place and gutting long term plays to save a few bucks. Sold ARM division just before the iPhone came out, sold the mobile modem division (to Apple) as we transition to 5G, dropped the efforts on GPUs multiple times (missing the boom in AI),  stopped making SSD controllers, etc. This on top of their failings with node shrinks.

It's all fine to have great engineers but management is only allowed to miss the boat so many times before it becomes another Kodak.Smart people that got get lazy with no competition. They got caught with their pants down and but didn't realize even when amd was making headway. Now its code red over there and they are stumbling.I still want to know why Jim Keller left.  I have a suspicion that there is a culture issue there and it may take new management to fix it.People working at Intel always say working there is like working for government, bad sign if you're doing cutting edge stuff.> Intel has the smartest minds in the business

Do they? In terms of fabs, arguably the best people are at TSMC. For processor stuff, AMD is beating them. One of the best people in terms of semiconductors is Jim Keller. And he [very abruptly resigned resigned from Intel](https://www.anandtech.com/show/15846/jim-keller-resigns-from-intel-effective-immediately) last month.Smart minds get poached by competition. Don’t think for a second high end engineers don’t think about “I wonder if working for that company working with newer tech would be more interesting”.  

Talent is key to innovation. Ideas come from smart people, smart people gravitate to good leaders and companies that get out of their way and let them go as fast as possible. 

Very likely intel has lost that rep in the marketplace.They used to. Until bean-counter CFO turned CEOs stifled innovation.Id argue 18 months (Alder lake time frame) not 4 yearsSpeaking as someone in the industry. hahahahahahahaha hahahahahahaha, no. Intel definitely does not have the brightest minds in the business.Smart people are ditching left and right. Smart people don't like being shat on by management. The guy who spearheaded Zen left to work for intel 2 years ago and he already noped the fuck out of there, presumable because of management and this news. These people don't need money, they need to be allowed to execute.King of what? Lol Intel can buy out amd tomorrow with cash if they wanted toCorrect me if I'm wrong, but in the earnings call they said that if they were to use external foundries they would focus on 10nm.  They expect 7nm in late 2022 or 2023.AMD is king of the budget build gaming PC too.The margin on those is probably microscopic, while Xeons are basically printing money for Intel.Even better - who manufacturers the machines that TSMC uses??TSMC is by far the safest semi play in my mind. I hold NVDA, TSM, LSCC in the semi space weighted in that orderASML has basically a monopoly on EUV lithography.Intel is definitely headed to be the next IBM. But they are aren't there yet. They still have increasing revenues. What's crazy is that they are at lower valuations than IBM who continues to have decline in revenues YOY.That's pretty ignorant of both companies' business models$TSM all the way

Until China takes TaiwanTheir p/e makes it a meme stock + the stock moves like a meme stockThe stock price is almost completely decoupled from the revenue the company actually generates. It's backed by hype and hope.I just learned about them today.  And bought in today shortly after.  Great growth with a nice dividend on top.  Will DCA into this for sometime.  I bought in on the Robinhood app, and I am brand new to using something other than vanguard for investing.  Is it a smart vessel?  ESP considering the concept of dividends?  Or are higher paying dividend stocks better in tax advantaged accounts?This is not the early 2000s at all. Back then Intel had the best fabs in the business and no one else came close. Today they are not only competing with AMD in terms of chip design, but with TSMC on manufacturing capabilities. And that is a much tougher fight.Time has changed. The business has been always about scale. This time around, though, Intel’s scale is matched by TSMC, AMD’s manufacturer. I see a long bull case of AMD for this reason.

This is also the reason Apple dumped INTC not long ago. Because TSMC or Samsung will have the scale to match INTC in terms of manufacturing capability, apple feels safe working on its own CPU.Puts on AMD?  If so, ouch!couldn't resist it, got some.Don't you know ? 7nm at amd is same as 10mm at Intel! This drop makes me laugh.AMD chips were powering the Xbox One and PS4 when the stock was trading at $2/share.You shouldn’t be. AMD has fantastic leadership with Lisa Su at the helm and their new processors are fantastic in every category, eating up intels market share. An AMD resurgence is just around the corner.I used to believe in the mantra of go woke go broke like 2-3 years ago until I realized it was all bullshit cherry-picking. At least in the film/gaming industry. Especially with captain marvel, a movie pretty much designed only to make money on the fact that the main character is a woman. Every comment I saw was something of “go woke go broke, marvel slipped up this time!!”, when in reality it was one of the highest grossing films for marvel. We even see it today with The last of us 2. The main character is a buff woman and every capital G gamer is having a mental battle over how it’s not possible. The same line is repeated of “They ruined the last of us! Go woke go broke!”., yet it’s the the absolutely crushing it in sales, and up on the top charts. 

I feel the phrase is just a way for people to support their own belief that being woke is stupid, that everything is fine as is, and that it’s just “libtards wrong”.Let’s see the screenshot.No you didntI bought 1 AMD 65 C expiring 8/21 today near the close just for the hell of it. Paid 2.09.As a SE and someone who follows the industry closely, you are incredibly, woefully uneducated and ignorant about this market. AMD's resurgence had virtually nothing to do with the crypto craze, and was driven entirely by the retirement of Bulldozer and the introduction of Ryzen. It was a game changer for AMD and Intel, the same way AMD's introduction of the superior x86_64 instruction set was over IA_64. Disruptive enough and timed precisely enough that it forced Intel's hand into a number of shoddy releases on the i7 line. Ryzen is objectively a superior product to anything in the i7 lineup now for all but a few work cases. Memory latency was one of the biggest advantages Intel had, and that advantage is now gone - so it will force Intel to be innovative again, which they haven't had to do since the failure of Bulldozer. I look forward to what Intel will do - the last time AMD was this disruptive, it forced Intel to ditch the P4 architecture, and they came up with Core - the base of all Intel desktop and server CPUs today. We could see another revolution from Intel as the result of AMD's recent success.

You have no idea what you are talking about.> No person in their right mind would build an AMD processor pc over an intel processor

You are out of your mind if you actually think this, Intel only beats AMD in gaming by a small margin and gets creamed everywhere else, including price. Nobody is buying Intel CPUs anymore except the top 1% performance chasers.Too late, it will pump on this news AH, open high, and immediately sell off within 24 hours like everything else.Do it with straddles/strangles on any company 2 weeks before earnings.It is actually not always the way, 2019 q3 earning was a recent exception. Amd had a modest drop after ER for one day or two, and then rose $20 from there almost non-stop.

IMHO, it really has something to do with future outlook, if Dr. Su provides a great outlook this time, I don’t see a big drop post ER.Yes this is the way.Yeah pretty much. Intel isn't going anywhere for now unless their CEO gets caught with hookers and blow or something of that nature. AMD chips still aren't competing with Intel.Look at their gross margin erosion and Q3 guidance and even lower gross marginAnalysts are worthless and their expectations should always be ignored. They’re tarot card readers for grown men.I don't know. Do you want a good company for a bad price or a bad company for a good price?Losing partnership with Apple is a big deal, and as a PC enthusiast, I can confidently say the AMD ryzen 9 series is destroying the i9 right now in terms of how many I see in custom builds. Why? It’s significantly cheaper and has more cores. Intel is honestly  snoozing hard right now and in desperate need of innovation, considering they have not made any significant leap in technology since the release of the i7 like well over a decade ago. Lets also not forget that AMD powers the PS5 which had a 50% increase in production to keep up with demand, I have some Sony shares as well that have been doing pretty good.Depends on if you think intel will keep its success in the future. Intel's a solid company with stable revenue and earnings. And it's much, much larger than AMD and more diversified. AMD is a growth stock, and shows promise, but I am uncertain about its long term viability. Imo I would take the safe bet and snag a few shares of intel here and there when it drops, like this rn.If you want to buy Intel then wait at least to the low end of 50. I think tomorrow it will dip down to 51-52$ and end the day around 54-56$.Very smart. AMD is an even smarter sellIntel is diversified, but the most profitable products the server CPU and CPU for laptops are under attack from AMD. The technological and cost advantage of AMD is huge, but AMD lacked the infrastructure for maintenance and design of systems . Should AMD be able to build a comparable infrastructure for servers and OEM CPU for laptops I wouldn't give a cent for Intel.Nah. I don't have faith in their leadership. The fact that they could let AMD (a company near death) get up on them like this is astounding. Its being run by suits who only saw dollar signs, and now they are paying for their lack of investment into internal R&D. 

I wouldn't touch them until they have a competitive product. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nsX9nUFIBc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nsX9nUFIBc)The industry is moving toward ARM SoCs.  So I don't see Intel making another comeback like that but that doesn't mean it's any good for AMD either.Didn't Intel undercut amd heavily in the early 200s to kill off AMD?  That got them into all the desktops and laptops.Intel crushed AMD with the Core 2 Duo and it has taken AMD 12 ish years to finally catch back up. Now they look poised to dominate Intel for the next decade.So intel’s the new Blackberry?Bro r u a cavemanDon't bother explaining this on r/Investing where people think "Intel, oh, ahhhhhh, they make gaming CPUs and I know AMD doing better than them at that!"

I like to say Intel is like an oil company - their business relies on a crucial input, semiconductors. In the same way, a vertically integrated oil company uses petroleum to make all sorts of different chemicals to satisfy different markets. 

Intel uses its main input to make 20 or 30 types of outputs while AMD outputs 5-10 products.> but there is way more to Intel then semiconductors

Not really, no. Just read Intel's earnings report

> We derive a substantial majority of our revenue from platform products.

Almost all their revenue comes from PC, data center, and memory chips. Everything else is a foot note.More dollars spend on R&D doesn't in and of itself guarantee a superior, or even a good, outcomeUh no. Anything Intel does other than semiconductors is a drop in the bucket.Hold. I'm not sure I would reinvest the dividends in Intel though. At least use them to diversify your portfolio.If you had the equivalent amount in cash would you put it all in Intel? No? Then rebalance.Is AMD going to translate that technology into revenue at some point?Selling the modem business was smart. There’s not a way they could even make a profit off it. Why not get a billion dollars.Dude calm down...they've missed the boat once. It's not the end of the world.Smart people with bad management, also those smart people may have left.

This is top down systemic bad results.  It is not easily fixed by time or money.  It will take a lot of work.  They could never recover or it could take 10-20 years like amd did to beat them.You're not wrong, but it happens. Semiconductors are a very cut throat business and that's why it's so fascinating.They should have just moved to TSMC fab.What I've heard made it seem like Jim Keller was an asshole - who was right in trying to change Intel culture, but went about it in a very arrogant way. And I also heard in the two years he was at Intel he didn't do much of anything because he wanted everything done his way obviously.Been my experience at a variety of large tech firms.  I also doubt it is anything new.  Intel has been a big company for decades.> Intel can buy out amd tomorrow with cash if they wanted to

Been that way for years.  I think the anti-trust implications keep them from buying up AMD.It’s turtles all the way down. Invest in turtles.KLA, ASML, etc. Their stocks have been going up like crazy past few years.That would be ASML.LRCX makes electrofill machines for 3D NANDThat’s why I bought it. The logic was that they couldn’t lose, and after several years that logic still holds up. In hindsight I wish I had gone with the riskier choice of AMD, but hindsight is 2020.Aren't you worried about Samsung catching up?China is like RIGHT there and Taiwan is on their shopping list. If anything threatens Taiwan, TSMC is going to turn into a very very bumpy ride.

Also, we're about to go through a big smartphone slowdown which means both Apple and Qualcomm are going to cut their orders with TSMC.

Apple already cut their screen orders and paid $1 B to Samsung to do it.TSMC is the safest buy in the market right now, IMO. 

They benefit double from Intel failing — they fab for both Apple and AMD.I'm not familiar wth LSCC. Why should I look out for them?No question about it they are the only player in the game.I mean, it's not: but go on?“Is it different this time.”Yeahhh I was up $300 at the end of the day. Thought we might drop further today. Oh well. Maybe it will after the earnings and I'll get luckyThe PS5 is not the PS4, it’s made some significant leaps in ssd technology, the demos I have seen of in game footage are insane, especially the new ratchet and crank.

Also, past data is not a 100% indicator of future data, AMD up 15% at close today.

I will argue that neither the PS4/Xbox one were not that great of systems to begin with at the time, the tech from the previous systems did not advance that much outside an increase in core count and clock speed, and, they couldn’t do 4K hence the release of the pro/x series. I’m not saying it wasn’t an improvement, but it’s like putting an i7 against an i9 today. [https://imgur.com/t/coffindance/0Y8Djdw](https://imgur.com/t/coffindance/0Y8Djdw)Nothing to do with the crypto boom? Now I know your're a moron, just look at the price of AMD, it was at lows for years right up until the crpyto boom starting in late 2016.This seems like legit good news though. I thought TWTR was gonna fizzle out when that subscription rumor came out but it held fairly strong. This AMD news seems pretty good for their futureThen wait for the pop, buy puts and then sell.

EDIT: guys don't take trading advice from me. I only described what you can do if you suspect /u/boon4376's setup will play out. I can't predict the market. What I described is a play action setup. Also scalping in the first hour of the market hour is very hard. It's very volatile and you can get stopped out if you aren't careful.Just buy, wait till market close, place a sell order for more than you bought it, at open if it’s up it will closeListen to this guyOh so you mean like it did 2 days ago? Lol AMD is such a roller coaster and I love it2019 q3 was when they dropped the Ryzen 3rd Generation, right?? AMD is beating Intel in every single chip category, with the exception of a single digit % in single core performance in gaming.

Yesterday's news simply confirmed that this will be the case until 2023 at least.What are you smoking?>AMD chips still aren't competing with Intel.

couldn't be more wrong in the server space, and hell even now in the consumer space AMD chips are much more of a bargain than aging Intel 14nm tech.Intel or AMD?Well that sort of makes it sound as if both companies are at least somewhat good optionsI feel like an Intel resurgence is inevitablePeople have not noticed how bad Intel is for years, in this particular case i would definitely bet my money on bad company for a good price.Did you just call Intel a bad company? LolWhich companies are good/bad here?Wow, can't believe the i7 is that old... \*looks in mirror\* oh yeah.....A bit too much has been made of the Apple CPU change, IMHO.  It's 5% of their PC business.  It's true they'd rather retain them than lose them, but it's not a death blow.  I'd be more concerned if Dell, Lenovo, or HP ditched them.Aight thanks for the advice man. I just started learning how to trade stocks and am trying to piece together basic thinking patterns/ reasoning.Perfect call, now calm my worries and tell me it’ll be back up to $60 by late August 🙏🏻Sold ~half my AMD shares yesterday.The Ryzen 5 offering for laptops is a killer. I have one, the laptop was cheap as fuck and the CPU is blazing fast.I'm holding out hope for RISC 5. Honestly it has better potential and a lower licensing cost.This, but also don't forget AMD has a lead on APUs and significant experience with GPUs. 

They need a path forward after x86, but they're still in better shape than Intel. 

Side note: We're all focusing on AMD, but also long term hold on NYSE:TSM, which will benefit just as much from this news.no it is not, don't make me laughAnd intel's entire empire was built off the back of having the undisputed best fabs  in the world.  They often led the nearest competition by 2+ years.  Now they are 2 years behind TSMC.  It is a different world now.  AMD is only one of the companies they are losing ground to.Except those people are largely right.

Half of Intel's revenue comes from consumer PCs, with the second largest segment data centers. Everything else they do is a footnote in comparison to these two groups. Intel is *not* well diversified and this is a direct result of their failure in GPUs, mobile, wearables, selling off their modem business, losing Apple as a customer, etc. This is a company increasingly reliant on a few high margin products. If those products lose ground to AMD they are in an *incredibly* precarious position. Intel looks to be a company *in decline*.Yeah the problem is the market is flooded with people who think like this. Intel's fundamentals are very strong. Doesn't matter, AMD had a couple of good years so Intel is dead apparently>"Intel, oh, ahhhhhh, they make gaming CPUs and I know AMD doing better than them at that!"

This is ironic to me, someone in tech, because this is exactly the opposite of what's happened. Intel's reliance on monolithic die design has severely stunted their ability to compete on a core-number level. In fact, the real irony in the incorrectness of your statement is that the \*only thing Intel is leading currently\* is single threaded, high throughput gaming. Not AMD. It's a lot closer than it used to be, and I suspect AMD will overtake them in that field as well, but for now your statement is categorically and objectively wrong.Intel looks like Blackberry in 2007 right now. They have no growth story.

Even if they manage to pick up the slack and stop the hemorrhaging to AMD, Apple is about to completely change the face of the industry by switching to their own silicon, and that will bleed into PCs as Microsoft looks to compete. Five years from now the majority of laptops will be running an ARM chip.

What is Intel doing? They're investing in their own discreet GPUs, I guess, but that doesn't really seem promising at all.>Intel, oh, ahhhhhh, they make gaming CPUs and I know AMD doing better than them at that!

Given the IO, gaming is literally the most processor consuming task you can do. There are games with such high refresh rates that they make tools like CAD and Matlab look like a joke. Being able to make a chip good enough for gaming is the ultimate CPU/GPU you can think of (for retail users anyway).

Also, 90% of Intel's revenue comes from CPU market (consumer and data center- [https://www.statista.com/statistics/495928/net-revenue-of-intel-by-segment/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/495928/net-revenue-of-intel-by-segment/)), what else is Intel making from them semiconductors that we have never heard of?Indeed. They could have avoided a lot of that R&D if they just went fabless like AMD did. I mean, look at all that money spent and they're still years behind schedule on 7nm.Building market share, especially in the high margin server segment, takes a long time. The server super computers and big data centers being built today were planed years ago and the people designing them arent as quick to jump onto new and unproven tech as end users are. AMD has only been competitive for about 2 years, if they continue to turn out good products they will continue to increase their market share and that will translate into revenue.There's not a lot of competition in the sector actually (Qualcomm, Samsung and Mediatek - Huawei being kinda on the bench right now) so there was space for Intel.

And if they ever get back in making phone CPU, they'll need it very so badly.He just listed like 6 times they missed the boat.That's the thing: they missed it many, many times.>	Smart people with bad management, also those smart people may have left.

Smart people don’t stick around with bad management. It’s a lose-lose situation, either you push for change and get blamed or stay silent and suffer. Bad management wouldn’t be bad if they were able to improve.Exactly, management is key to utilizing smart people.  Look at the decline of GE, they had the smartest and brightest but failed to prune inefficiencies and doubled down on bad investments.Not when you work there.. helpConsidering the way things are now, they probably should have just done it his way.Nvidia famously has a startup culture. Wouldn't be surprised if AMD wasn't the same after they changed the CEO, or they wouldn't be able to turn around in such short few years. I think it's pretty difficult to argue that bureaucracy doesn't slow down innovation. After all, Intel fucked up the 10nm node because they tried to move faster than they could handle.Also it's way overpriced and Intel has all the tech and ifrastructure alreadyTokyo Electron, Applied Materials, Lam Research too.Eh, I think you made the right choice as you probably had reduced stressNot really, they are both on track for 3nm chips in 2022. I think the vast majority of business partners will stick with TSMC as long as they are neck to neck. I have faith in Taiwan and all the bright minds from there drool over the chance to work for them.It was just reported that Samsung is struggling with 5nm yield while TSMC is ramping up 5nm production.TSMC is building a new fab in ArizonaA leader in low power programmable chips which is a market I see growing very rapidly as we start putting chips in more and more productsVery much so. Unlike the early 2000s, Intel is now facing a 2 front war: A manufacturing process war against TSMC and x64 chip design war against AMD and as of right now, it is losing on both fronts. And TSMC is a $40 billion a year revenue juggernaut that will make it very tough for Intel to catch up to. On top of that, there is a paradigm shift in computing due to shift towards ARM architecture and AI, and Intel is simply not well positioned to tackle either.My point is that AMD has been selling chips to Sony and Microsoft for seven years and while it's certainly good news for AMD that they were selected as the vendor for the PS5/Xbox Series X that doesn't actually translate to a significant increase in revenue. They've *retained existing customers* for another console generation.You are 100% wrong. AMD's mark on the crypto space wasn't felt until late 2017, because their RX series and prior cards were inferior for the profitable algos prior to that to any Nvidia GPUs, primarily being ethash. AMD's entrance wasn't until Vega+Cryptonight pairing, a launch that  came after their resurgence. Their boom started directly with the announcement of Ryzen. 

You see, I know what I'm talking about. Do your research or GTFO.I sold my calls at the last pump so I hope it goes down and I'll buy more again. I think long term they are a really good bet.Legit good news = stock price goes down, dummy.AMD already has a bright future, but I think it is priced in already (and has been). I sold all my AMD beginning of pandemic. Missed out on some nice gains, but I also made nice gains because I got in early so no big regrets. 

I hope to buy in again when the market comes to its senses one dayDo you think it’s worth putting in calls at open? Or just to wait for it to peak tomorrow and put in some putsI’m inHonestly I forgot when they announced Ryzen 3 g. With the hinder sight, Amd sp in Nov/Dec 2019 probably had something to do with Jan 2020’s announcement of new mobile CPUs offerings, which was a very competitive product and a big surprise to me.20 years of experience over multiple states working in IT. Intel is going to bounce back.Market saturation, sir.Intel. It dropped 7% YoYJust buy the semi conductor etf. This Industry is here to stay and growing.I wouldn't hate buying both right nowThen buy Intel in 2022. It's all about the right timing.Then buy the dip. It's all about time in the market.Lol, no new desktop node in 10 years, lolTheir cpus have had many nasty security flaws in recent times. The flaws lets you read from other places in memory. This has even been possible in browsers. So yes, it comes as no shock to me that share prices are down or that Apple wants to ditch Intel. AMD is in for a serious rally if it can capture the cloud.They've had as bad a last five years as you can imagine when they had a monopoly position in x86. When you look at the other side of the aisle with Nvidia the difference in innovation culture is obvious.People will throw around AMD numbers when it involves cores and node size, but bring IPC into the equation...AMD is the good company at a bad price, Intel is the bad company at a good priceI know that feel broLenovo was showcasing AMD mobile cpu's at CES2020.

HP and Dell probably won't change, consumers care far less on power performance savings than people running huge server infrastructures.

people building Custom PC's will absolutely shop around and choose AMD at current more often than Intel.As a customer Apple is low-volume but high-margin.Im not saying there are going to go bankrupt, there are just not a great long term investment at the moment. Again, I have yet to really see them do anything new and innovative for years now, which is literally the reason why Apple dropped them outside of wanting to make the silicon for their cpus in house.Realistically, I would pick AMD and TSMC and then buy Intel when it goes a little lower for the dividend.

&#x200B;

By the way, Q1 2019 earnings for Intel was almost as bad as this report and the stock fell from $58 to $44 within a few weeks. So right now, I've set a target at $40 to start looking into buying more INTC.Well...like all Tech stock lately there will be a big sell off after earning. So I think AMD will be the same too but I don't think it will go back to 50-ish. 60-ish should be their new low.

When AMD go down people will buy back Intel so 60$ around August is not impossible.Sold all my AMD shares a few years ago at $2.Do you plan to buy? And if so at what value?Man, missed a pretty nice run up.[deleted]It's going to be decades before consumers migrate over to ARM - if ever. There is a dedicated mobile use-case which I support - and maybe in certain server environments where power draw is a driving factor - but I don't see the business value in switching across to ARM for every other use-case right now.Isn't it completely free to use?When you say APU do you mean integrated graphics? I think Intel beats them with tiger lake U which I think is launching really soon.That's why I invested in TSMC, but neither intel or AMDIt's more like 3 years behind TSMC at this point, but yeah.Its definately an all hands on deck situation.Their data center group is up 43% vs Q2 2019 and their PC group up 7%. Even if all of Intel grew just 7%, that would still be a great number for a company with a PE of 11.  Intel revenue is up 20% vs Q2 2019. That's astounding for an 11 PE company. Their data center group is going to make up a larger portion of their revenue every year and revenue growth as a whole will speed up.It's the way it is lol. AMD and Intel will be doing this dance even after you and I are dead. They need each other and the market needs both.You’ve also got Apple moving away from Intel. Other large companies seem to be pursuing PowerPC or ARM custom processors for servers.He putted it in quotes to suggest that's what vast majority of AMD investors think, and that's pretty true, even though it's ironic and wrong. It's not a statement he is making himself, it's an example of the idea what most investors think in regards to AMD. So dont call him out on being "objectively wrong" on something he's not claiming himself.Not on a price/ performance basis. Not many gamers are going out there buying an i9 extreme..They have a lot of bright spots.

Straight from earnings call:

"data-centric businesses grew 34%"

They also mentioned Intel edge computing which includes autonomous driving,AI, industrial automation, and edge computing.

This is going to be huge and Intel really is the only player in this market. 10 years from now it's going to be seen as a huge windfall.

AMD is nonexistent in this market, Nvidia is.

Intel is a lot of things and their desktop CPUs are a very important part, but not the whole story.

Let's wait and see what happens in 2025 before envisioning these apocalyptic scenarios.

[Quite An Interesting Read](https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4360453-intel-corporation-intc-ceo-bob-swan-on-q2-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript)

To me, that earnings call shows that Intel knows what's wrong and they are working to fix things. Self criticism is very important to success. 

BlackBerry did nothing, I find it a little annoying you would even compare Intel to them frankly.>	What is Intel doing? They’re investing in their own discreet GPUs, I guess, but that doesn’t really seem promising at all.

I had to check the calendar because I could have sworn it’s not the 00’s. Are they calling it Larrabee Next or did they decide to be less obvious about the code name? Intel is the IBM of semiconductors, same old, same old.> Five years from now the majority of laptops will be running an ARM chip.

Why would that happen now, when it didn't with the Alpha, or PowerPC chips?  It's not like there haven't been hot CPUs before, back when CPU performance mattered a heck of a lot more.

Also Apple was like 5% of the PC market.  It's a blow, but hardly a deathblow.  The real players to watch are HP, Dell, and Lenovo.Current CPUs are actually much more optimized for streaming and video editing. This is why Intel is still competitive with AMD for gaming even though AMD has way more cores. Those cores give AMD an advantage in benchmarks and in certain workloads but max single core speed is still the most important spec for gaming and that hasn’t really change for the last 5 years or more and Intel still has an edge on AMD.

I would argue that ROM and RAM have also stagnated since SSDs became widely available 5 years. Sure you could eek out 5% gains on certain games with high speed RAM but in the process you end up with way worse stability.

GPUs on the other hand have been improving in gaming performance 20% YoY, which is why I usually recommend that PC builders put half their budget to their GPU.IDK, they give up a LOT of control by going fabless.  AMD took a big gamble when they sold off their fabs, a lot of people in the industry wrote them off when it happened, and their stock price dropped to $2.  Definitely paid off for them, but there are serious advantages to having your own fab, which is why Intel has been able to do so much with their older fabs.But they’ll sell it to probably one customer, Apple, who will negotiate a thin profited deal because they’re likely the only customer. Samsung will make their own, Huawei will make their own, google would probably choose Qualcomm.Explain?^SameThat's not really how people or companies work though at all.Totally agree. The executives, but likely not the engineers, are seemingly steering the ship ashore. From afar, it looks like Intel, collectively, got complacent and rested on their laurels — and now it looks like it's coming back to haunt them.Intel has about 10x the employees of either NVidia or AMD, but that has not changed much in the past 20 years, and yet in the past couple of years they've been struggling.

https://notesmatic.com/2018/08/intel-corporation-number-of-employees/Agreed.  Might have made more sense a few years ago when the stock was at $2-3.Definitely reduced stress but I had coworkers who got a 2000% return investing in AMD. They quit their job ... coincidence?That's cool and all, but remember that TSMC was always  1-2 steps behind Intel until... it suddenly wasn't.Which won't be online for a while.How is the shift to ARM explaining AMD going up, again?

Furthermore. Intel's product line this year was always about 10nm. They've accelerated this process utilization. Somehow, everyone is up in arms about a process that was always going to launch 2021 earliest.

Intel can always use TSMC just like AMD does. "AMD uses TSMC" is not a competitive advantage of AMD over Intel.Fair enough, I just see the 50% increase in production as really good news for both sony and AMD considering the state of the world right now, unless earnings really disappoint I plan on holding for quite some time since revenue growth has a nice clean trend up.Yeah ok go ahead pour all your money into a meme stock like you probably did with a meme crypto like doge.If you can predict the peak than yes. It's predicting the peak that's hard. I'm not convinced it will peak tomorrow and drop.Bounce back from what? You just said AMD chips still aren't competing with Intel. You're not making a lot of sense.Which one?They have already had that rally.> Their cpus have had many nasty security flaws in recent times.

AMD has many of the same issues, and yet it's stock has been on a tear...Then AMD still leads in the desktop and server markets, with mobile Ice Lake's lower clocks undermining their IPC improvements. Outside of the rare software that can actually heavily utilize AVX512 AMD trails in exactly 2 areas: max clocks and cache latency.

As it so happens Milan is due out shortly and should address the latter while significantly boosting IPC (whether it addresses max clocks is TBD).A 70b company is bad and a 6b company is good?Intel is NOT a bad company. The only segment AMD is winning is gaming machines. Intel ain’t going anywhere.All three currently have AMD processors for sale, none of them are doing so as the default.  This is very different from them completely dropping Intel like Apple did.  Instead it's going to be a slow erosion of profits.  Intel still has a better brand than AMD, at least for most people.  

I'd agree with you that the enthusiast market is all AMD, just check this thread.  :)5% is 5%I disagree.  They still own the market, they're still a massive company, and right now they're trading at a significant discount.  

https://www.cpubenchmark.net/market_share.html

AMD/NVidia are poor investments atm, even if they do have an edge in product, because their stock prices are too high for little improvement they're showing.  AMD at P/E 167 is very expensive, really the only way they can go is down, even if it's going to take time.  NVidia has an only slightly less nose-bleed cost at 76 P/E.  Honestly TSMC is a far better investment than either AMD or NVidia.

Gamers are not really the market either, but even then Intel still has the fastest single threaded CPU, which is going to have more impact on game performance.  

Not that it really matters.  People installing i9 or ryzen 9 series are not a significant portion of the market.  A significant portion of the market are you mom and dad, and the bank down the street, and the boring insurance agency who needs something for their secretary.

I mean I get it, I've got an AMD in the PC I just built, but that's more because I like the price/performance ratio and any idea that there's some amazing difference between the two chips.

Further I've seen this movie a few times.  Intel makes a mistake, screws up, AMD eats their lunch for a while.  The did it with the Atholon, they beat Intel to 64 bits.  Then Intel comes back and is top dog for a while, rinse repeat.Interesting. Good stuff to know hmm I have never heard of TSMC before and just learned that it's an international stock which I guess I can't get since I use Robinhood mainly and am transitioning to Charles Schwab brokerage next week but they're both US based sadly. I'll keep an eye on AMD for sure and see what Intel is up to.Good point. INTC been around $44 during 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. Might as well wait for the dip.It better just make $61 by late August 🙏🏻[removed]Yep for sure... still have plenty and netted a 100+% profit on what I sold, I'll live.YesI wouldn’t be so sure until we see how Apple chips perform. If they are as good as the hype, I could imagine an ARMs race.Yup and you can add any extensions you want to add functionality.APU is AMD’s name for a CPU + GPU on the same substrate. Intel doesn’t have a separate name for them. 

While I am hopeful for Intel’s Tiger Lake products and their new graphics architecture... we shall see what these products look like in their final form come launch day.Tiger Lake is Intel's attempt to get back to iGPU performance parity with AMD, we'll see if it's successful.$TSMAt this point why would data centers keep buying Intel instead of AMD? Do they like security issues and paying more for less efficient chips that they run 24/7?These mofos see Intel miss step for 1 year and they think the story is over.

&#x200B;

After Tesla fanboys, these AMD guys really are the worst lmaoThe Goku and Vegeta of the chip making business> You’ve also got Apple moving away from Intel.

Apple's move away from Intel is mostly hype.  They were like 5% of the PC market, and mostly a niche player.  What would be more worrisome is if HP, Dell, or Lenovo moved to AMD or ARM exclusively.  They're not going to do that, because most people are not enthusiasts.  The mom and pop and pointy haired boss crowd all think AMD is a value brand.Apple really doesn’t manufacture many computers at all in the grand scheme of things. It makes next to no difference for IntelUnfortunately, a variety of relatively comparable Intel parts can be found [here](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/singleThread.html), with better single threaded performance than their AMD price-rivals. If you look at some of the i5 line (particularly the 9th gen KF parts), you'll see that the performance/price metric actually places Intel further ahead by a wide margin in single-core performance.

To reiterate - I think that AMD is a better value in overall terms. However, this does not invalidate the fact that your statement on single threaded performance is objectively incorrect.> Why would that happen now, when it didn't with the Alpha, or PowerPC chips? It's not like there haven't been hot CPUs before, back when CPU performance mattered a heck of a lot more.

Not sure what you mean. I don't know the full history of PPC/Alpha but that is essentially what happened with Intel. Apple switched to Intel in the first place because it was so much better at power per watt than PPC.

I can't remember exactly but a few years back some OEMs were making ARM Windows laptops with 24 hour + battery life. Obviously, Windows on ARM wasn't and still isn't ready, but the value prop of that battery gain was huge. Now that Apple is moving in that direction, I would be very surprised if Microsoft didn't get more serious about pushing ARM Windows.>Also Apple was like 5% of the PC market.  It's a blow, but hardly a deathblow.  The real players to watch are HP, Dell, and Lenovo.

Who all have very strong amd offeringsThe joke is probably that you wouldn't find cutting throats very interesting when it's your own throat on the line. Litterally.That has more to do with AMD being complete crap than Intel doing well though. Also, sub-micron fabrication is a lot easier than sub-nm fabrication. The amount of innovation needed to achieve sustainable improvement right now is a lot higher than it did before.Haha I had an old co-worker who bought AMD at $2 and sold at $13 thinking he made out like a banditI don't know how long OP plan on staying invested in TSMC but I'm personally not so I can't say for sure. As far as the current road map is concerned though, I don't see any major road block that'll stop TSMC from dominating the fab business.>How is the shift to ARM explaining AMD going up, again?

AMD is a still a niche player and gaining market share over that niche. Intel is a computing mainstream player and the shift to ARM is shrinking its mainstream dominance. Plus AMD has an AI play with its GPU and an ARM play with its GPU partnership with Samsung. Intel does not.

>Intel can always use TSMC just like AMD does.

They sure can, but that will affect their margins. And a lot of Intel's value came from the fact that they were ahead of the rest of the industry in terms of fabrication. By switching to TSMC they go from historicaly being ahead in terms of processes to going to parity with the rest of the industry on a permanent basis."I won't let this argument be dictated by facts!"

 - Etherdamus circa 2020SMHNot really. Meltdown is significantly worse than Spectre and it only affects Intel chips (and some arm). This combined with the pretty terrible response from Intel (lots of bugs related to their rushed patches) really made them seem amateurish compared to amd.One is expected to grow and the other is expected to shrink/stagnateYes, because their market cap is not the same, so you can't expect the same incomeActually, Intel is a 260 billion $ company.

&#x200B;

NVM, you meant CF.I agree that Intel is not a bad company, but AMD is winning in more than just gaming machines and has a lot more room for growth than Intel.AMD is winning in Single Threaded, multithreaded, core count, power efficiency, yield, ipc, gaming, synthetic benchmarks, IO bandwidth, PCIE Speed, and CPU security.   The only thing it is behind  in is pure frequency but that is tied to the architecture and absolutely meaningless on it's own without taking into account IPC. I would even say that the only thing INTEL had on AMD was gaming before the launch of Zen 2. After Zen 2 intel has nothing left.  I have a 9900K i9 from launch and I would absolutely not have bought that if AMD had the 3950X or 3900X out at the time.AMD has HEDT on lockdown, has very formidable mobile, makes progress in server.

What happens when Ice Lake server is not better than 14nm? They will just try to push AVX512?

In fact gaming is the only sector Intel hasPreachWhat's the 5% of? 5% of revenue isn't the same as 5% of profit.Hmm, you actually raise some good points. 

Either way, I’m happy with the current pump I’m in and will most likely sell after earnings.Where are you at? UK?Uh you can buy TSMC on Robinhood. I did it a few weeks ago and made a quick 9% profit before I sold. I've since switched to Ameritrade TD though for something more reliable in case shit hits the fan.I think TSM is the stock tickerRIPYour submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

Longer battery life. This makes sense for mobile use-cases but not for others.

On the other side there are enormous hurdles to overcome for the migration, so it's not as if we can expect this to occur organically. Additionally, if Apple is the only OEM with with decent ARM chips, Linux and Windows will stay with x64. Since they comprise the vast majority of server, consumer desktop and laptop, and business desktop and laptop, software will stay with x64 for a very long time.

I think we're far more likely to see a shift to SaaS in multiple segments with a thin-client approach on even traditionally thick-client environments. CPUs will become less important.Yea apple is going to be the test case. If they are getting solid results expect everyone else to jump into the arm soc game.TSM TSM TSM
DoubleliftuuInstitutional investments. They bought into Intel a long time ago, and they've got buyer pipelines and customized code investments that outweigh the efficiency gap.AmenPeople like you are the worst. AMD is doing an amazing job just like tesla. I dont own any AMD stock but I can see that they are doing a better job than intel at the moment. You can call them the worst but they have clearly out performed the market by looking at the future instead of the past/present. They never say that intel is dead or anything. They just are just saying that AMD is beating intel big time at the moment, which is definitly true.Why are you so angry?If Apple laptops suddenly start having better performance and better battery life because of the move to ARM then the other manufacturers may be forced to follow suit. The cheapest iPhone is (was?) faster than the most expensive Android. I vaguely recall Microsoft experimenting with ARM on the Surface line of laptops already.They didn’t make cell phones until 2007, and now they control a significant market share. I’m not going to bet against it.Intels server CPU are more expensive and slower and this is the cash cow of Intel. Then there are the CPU for laptops and AMD seems to be capable to deliver cheaper CPU which are faster in modern applications. The gamer scene is complete uninteresting because the market is so small.yea but they have less threads at the same price level.

single thread performance matters only in Gaming, and games are not bottle necked in FPS by CPUs they are bottle necked in GPUs which Nvidia and AMD both have a larger share of.

GPUs matter more for AI as well where Nvidia is killing it in the TPU space.

we all need to face the facts that if your not building the highest spec gaming PC you are going to be choosing AMD CPUs on price/performance and Nvidia GPUs.

high single core speed means fuck all for 80% of Gamers who are building new machines that will run any game just fine and spend most of their money on the graphics card. Most people would rather have more threads and cores at the same price point to be able to multitask better.Didn't know that was still not true. I haven't really been into gaming since 2017.> Not sure what you mean. I don't know the full history of PPC/Alpha but that is essentially what happened with Intel. Apple switched to Intel in the first place because it was so much better at power per watt than PPC.

That's what Steve said, but honestly there was a lot more to it that didn't make for a good presentation.  PowerPC was IBM, and they were struggling to make the transition to 90 nm.  Yields were down, prices were up.  (And Jobs was never going to say to Apple buyers "we're buying the cheaper alternative").  Further the PowerPC was a dead architecture, and never had the kind of buy in that the x86 architecture has.  PowerPC was pretty much Apple, and IBM mainframes, not a massive, growing market, or at least one of the size necessary to play the fab upgrade game.

A 24 hour laptop battery is even less necessary than a 24 hour phone battery.  Most people use the laptop for 8-10 hours a day, and then plug it in, assuming they unplugged it in the first place.  Having battery support that extends longer than that is unnecessary, since people will just plug it in.

What really does matter is what software is supported, and right now that's the x86 instruction set.  Apple might be able to get people to switch, since there are far fewer applications for MacOS, most of which are in house, but it's not the same on Windows, where people (and businesses) want/need to run software from 5-10 years ago.  Particularly bad in business, where you've got some goofy app the CEO's kid wrote 5 years ago, and controls half the functions of the business.  :)

The move to browsers helps with this transition quite a bit, but for serious applications the browser still isn't quite there, because it has to go back to the server every time it needs a new bit of data.It's definitely shifted, but look who's the default for those manufacturers?  And have any of them stopped using Intel?  There's a difference between Apple's complete stop, and the major PC manufacturers offering AMD processors.Yeah, to be honest I don’t know if this coworker sold, but they did buy in that same range and seemed to be a true believer (he said he was “all in”)Am I your old coworker? I had 1500 shares average under $3.. I traded in and out the whole way up which was very lucrative, but doing the math I’d have been better off sitting on my hands and letting her gain. I’m a better investor for it now.You're explaining the psychology of AMD/INTC investors very well, but the facts and numbers don't match that psychology at all.

AMD and Intel were founded 1 year apart in the late 60s. AMD isn't this brand new Tesla-type startup that's growing from a niche player to mainstream.

They've both been around, and Intel knows how to play the x86 game. Their shared problem is that the x86 market as a whole is shrinking.

The GPU is not a unique advantage here.  It doesn't compete with Intel on that ground, but with everyone. The x86 patents don't matter, it's full of GPU makers. Apple doesn't seem to mind making their own for ex. 

AMD has somehow maintained this "underdog" status forever... because they always underperform, and they always look like they're getting ahead, but they never do. Check the stock market price of AMD on weekly bars. It's had two major booms and busts based on the same thesis you just outlined. How they gon' overtake Intel and what not.

And we're in a third boom.

We have three things that are "different this time": vastly underestimated recession/depression gaining momentum, the monetary policy helping inflate the bubble, and the fact the x86 advantage is turning into a disadvantage. None of those are actually good for AMD's longterm prospects.

You just need to look at the P/E of both companies and realize Intel is way undervalued and AMD is hilariously overvalued. Yeah this can keep going for a little bit more. Maybe. But I feel this ER will be the start reality returning to AMD.I’m also disappointed> Meltdown is significantly worse than Spectre and it only affects Intel chips (and some arm).

Sure, but there seems to be this attitude that AMD did not have these problems, and they did.

Also most of this is hype, since there have been no malware reported in the wild, and most people aren't bothering to patch because it doesn't matter.  Do you think that most PC buyers even know what those exploits are?They produce more than just CPUs like network cards.
Most of the production network cards are Intel.
More than 50%

Never heard of amd network card.One has grown from 50b to 70b in 8 years

The other from 6.6b to 6.7b in the same time periodThe 10 pe ratio company with a dividend is bad, but the 200 pe ratio no dividend company is good?Cool. A gaming PC. That’s a tiny percent of the market. This isn’t who’s dick is bigger CPU speed because nerds like games subreddit. This is INVESTING. Cloud computing moves markets. Intel owns that business. What are you? Drunk?Oh wait... Intel might lose out on a few shitty laptop sales. Oh no.Oh, Intel is doing better on yield? When they don't even have fabs?

&#x200B;

And if you are talking about Global Foundries...they are a joke, please read up on them, they are 2 years behind Intel...and as we all know, Intel is behind.https://www.marketwatch.com/story/in-this-case-losing-apple-as-a-customer-would-be-good-news-2020-06-15You might be making the better trade, you never know.  I'm looking to wait a year or two at least to see this out.  I might break even, or lose a bit, but I doubt Intel is going away anytime soon.Turns out I was wrong and it's TSM not TSMC. Can get it now yayYeah you're right, I was looking for TSMC and couldn't find it and turns out its TSM.Yup that's why I was confused why I couldn't find it. Thank you!So mobile is already there, servers and cloud are being pushed there by economics, and apple is onboard now too.  That leaves PCs.  The majority of those are actually laptops, where low power directly translates into small size and long battery life like mobile.  I don't see desktop PCs being some kind of a lone holdout.  Recent surface tablets are ARM so I don't think Windows itself will be a problem.  Linux runs on everything under the sun including all of the servers and mobile devices above.

I don't see x86 going away completely and I expect it will hang on longest in legacy business type applications.  But I do expect a shift in the wider industry and as you mentioned, as CPUs become less important to most consumers they will become more commoditized which favors architectures like ARM with multiple suppliers.Linux isn't staying anything... There are several Arm based distros and software compiled for it. Windows is the only OS that needs to add ARM support. If they made a build with X86 emulation Intel and AMD would have a serious problem on their hands.C9 for life!> customized code investments

Well here’s the thing: x86-64 isn’t even an Intel invention, it was AMD. Yeah Intel has some optimizing compilers (that almost no one uses) SIMD extensions (that AMD has adopted as well), virtualization extensions, some things like Quicksync video, etc, but for the most part there isn’t much of a moat.And as the years go buy that will evaporate. Intel is multiple years behind catching AMD and it doesn't look like that is gonna change anytime soon. Stocks are about looking ahead not behind and the outlook for Intel is not good. IBM is a better investment over Intel at this point.>They bought into Intel a long time ago,

And how long ago do you think they started to plan to move off Intel due to the many Intel specific security issues that are especially dangerous for data centers?

>and customized code investments that outweigh the efficiency gap.

The _current_ efficiency gap. I'm sure they see the writing on the wall and they'd be idiots to not have started a plan to move to AMD when the efficiency gap becomes too wide to ignore.AMD is "not the worst" and I never, ever said that. AMD is a great company and has some great people.

&#x200B;

I said AMD fanboys are. You can see all the AMD fanboys swearing at people on this thread just because they said something else. It comes off as very toxic.

&#x200B;

You are actually a great example of that.> If Apple laptops suddenly start having better performance and better battery life because of the move to ARM then the other manufacturers may be forced to follow suit. 

How would they show it?  Serious question, since Apple has their own OS, it's difficult to compare to Windows based PCs in either category.  Just so many moving parts that effect performance.  Further, from what I can tell performance is not a priority for Apple users, since their PCs and laptops have historically lagged and been slow to refresh.

> The cheapest iPhone is (was?) faster than the most expensive Android. I vaguely recall Microsoft experimenting with ARM on the Surface line of laptops already.

Microsoft has support for ARM in Windows, just like they had support for Alpha, Itanium and PowerPC back in the day.  Generally it doesn't matter much, since most people don't want to go through the hassle of switching all their current software over to a new processor.  It's a bit easier to switch than it used to be, with everything on the web, and far fewer hw peripherals but it's still a pain.Bet against what?So then why the fuck are you pretending to be an authority on it?These manufacturers will never stop using both companies processers. Apple will release maybe 2 or 3 laptops a year, and I doubt even that: they can only afford to use one brand. The other oems release tens, maybe hundreds of models per generation, they can easily afford to span the price range and keep the good will of the CPU manufacturers by using both brandsYou are way exaggerating by saying x86 market is shrinking and computing is shifting to ARM. On mobile computing, yes. On high performance computing, no.people don't patch cpu firmare, OS vendors do, so it's automatically done via update mechanisms through things like windows, or linux distributions.

Of course most people don't understand those exploits, that's not really the issue.  They're concerning if you're say a cloud or shared computing vendor and want to keep your infrastructure secure so one client cant read information from another, if you had projects in the pipeline for leveraging secure computing resources on those processors that are now impossible to trust, or if you just lost 10-30% of your compute per core mitigating the exploits those patches addressed.  All of those were largely intel only problems because they were a different level of severity on intel chips.Sure, but what percentage of their revenue comes from network cards?Because console sales are down right now. After they launch they will have record earnings.Yes, Intel has done great in recent years, but their projections for the future call for stagnation.What a time to be aliveLMAO, If the stock is a crowded trade, has momentum, and the chart goes up it is a good company.

If it goes down or stays flat, the company is bad.Yes, that's what people are implying, but I think that is rather foolish. THERE IS NOTHING MORE APPEALING TO PEOPLE THAN OVERPAYING FOR EVERYTHING. SEE CALIFORNIA AND IT'S HOUSING MARKET. SEE ALL OF THESE DUMB HYPE STOCKS.Yes. If you noticed, bad companies always have much lower PE ratios than good companies.200 pe is trailing. It's been pricing in the console launch for about two years now.>Cloud computing moves markets. Intel owns that business.

For now. They will start to replace their chips with AMD over time, there's no reason not to, they're cheaper, more efficient, faster and have fewer security problems.Companies choosing between AMD and Intel have no reason to choose intel. They don’t give a damn about past performance of the stock.

One of the biggest costs of a data center is electricity costs. Given enough efficiency companies wouldn’t use Intel over AMD even if intel was supplying them parts for FREE.Cloud computing platforms are switching or adding options to use AMD EPYC servers (which are often cheaper for the same vCPU IIRC). AMD processors are actually better suited to data center needs and usages right now, it's just that switching out machines/platforms in data centers for cloud providers isn't a fast process. [See here.](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/amd/).

IMO, Intel wins out only in gaming (if you're to consider just the strength of their processors vs AMD at the same price point).

Obviously Intel produces more than just processors; their WiFi chips are industry leading AFAIK (just to name one). I would say though that their current x86 processor outlook isn't too hot.That... and everything else. I don't see a reason to buy Intel anymore in any segment, besides having the fastest possible gaming PC because Intel sells a higher clocked i9 than AMD's offerings.Apple also recently announced they’re moving away from intel, to their own custom ARM chipsets. They’re going to be able to come out with insane battery life laptops, and then if others want to compete on that they’re going to have to ditch intel for some product lines or do *something*. Microsoft will probably see an uptick in interest around their ARM surface books too as ARM becomes a more supported/adopted platform for laptops. I think this trend alone is a huge deal.

Sony and Microsoft are almost ready to release their next gen consoles, both based on AMD.

AMD also grew its server market share in the last couple of years, going from basically nothing at about 10% which is pretty crazy. Their offering is really attractive to data centers at the moment as they’re often winning on power efficiency, performance, and core count per dollar. Looks like that’s gonna be true for at least a little while now.

Big cloud providers like AWS used to be a total monopoly that intel had a death grip over, but now it’s being broken up too. There have been loads of new AMD based instance classes offered over the past year or so, and AWS are even now producing their own custom ARM chips and offering them as alternative to intel.

Intel isn’t really even in the GPU market and this is pretty much owned by AMD/Nvidia who are constantly making good progress.

And now Intel have shat the bed again with production issues.

It feels like a bit of a perfect storm for them. The longer term trends aren’t so obviously in-line with their core competencies anymore, they’re losing ground to AMD, and their big partners (Apple, AWS, etc) are reducing their dependence on intel and simultaneously competing with them.Not only does AMD have better yields using TSMC than intel. AMD has hugely better yields than intel even if they both used the same process on TSMC. This is one of the major advantages AMD chiplet design provides. This means AMD can achieve better yields and produce chips at lower cost than intel even after TSMC takes their cut. This also mean AMD can deliver in volume on massive core count chips.

If intel wanted to get into a pricing war with AMD they might as well be flushing that money down the drain. 

The cloud computing provider shift to AMD has already been set in motion. By the time intel can react the landscape will have already shifted significantly.>Oh, Intel is doing better on yield? When they don't even have fabs?

Do you mean AMD? If so, yes.

>And if you are talking about Global Foundries...they are a joke, please read up on them, they are 2 years behind Intel...

AMD is using TSMC. That's one of the advantages of AMD, they can switch fabs when needed.Same, I’m going to be watching for some good newsYes, they get thrown around.Yeah customized code pretty much pales in comparison to the costs of documentation, peripheral hardware, and peripheral services. I do think that people that primarily interact with processors through a consumer standpoint hugely underestimate the inertia of big purchasing/business though. It's not just "buy the cheap one" it's "get a sample, wait, test the sample, wait, submit it for approval, wait, get a change order in, wait, shelve the project, wait, fill the old orders, wait, get some new ones in, wait, work out the kinks, wait, document the change, wait, officially buy the cheap one". And I probably missed a few steps and some waiting.No it won't. Institutional investments don't get smaller with time, they grow. AMD has to provide a significant enough price/performance gap to overcome the future of platform lock in. And Intel doesn't have to catch up to AMD, they have to catch up to TSM. AMD is fabless; they don't own or operate the 5nm technology that Intel is struggling to catch up to.>How would they show it?

Battery life

CPU usage when performing equivalent tasks (Office, web browsing etc.)

Performance doing equivalent things (time to load an application that will be cross platform like Spotify, or load a web page)> How would they show it? Serious question, since Apple has their own OS, it's difficult to compare to Windows based PCs in either category. Just so many moving parts that effect performance.

Reviews, custom satisfaction, reinforcement of the premium brand. Apple removes a headphone jack - pretty much all phones follow. Removal of the headphone jack allowed them to do better water proofing. The switch to ARM may allow them to do a lot around performance and battery life compared to what they could accomplish with Intel.Bet against Intel slowly being nibbled away at by a move from x86 to ARM or PPC.Lol that's what people here do. The best part are the people who take random comments seriously. Tech specific subs are much better places to discuss this than /r/investing.It wouldn't be so egregious if his whole comment wasn't ridiculing people that don't know what they're talking about.

This comment thread should be archived.> These manufacturers will never stop using both companies processers.

Never is a very long time, but I feel like we're in violent agreement here.  If Intel or AMD falls behind significantly this might change, but not anytime soon.Sorry but your opinion is past expiration date.

ARM is making significant headway in cloud computing / servers, and Apple just announced they're moving all their laptops/desktops to ARM.

So by definition based on known facts, your "no" is wrong.>On high performance computing, no.

Right....

Matters big time when you're talking about the PC market which is one of Intel's main sources of revenue.

The dreaded performance hit hasn't materialized.

Finally this is all going away as new processors come out.  It's mostly an issue for old, already sold processors.People have been saying this for two console generations. Its minuscule business. MSFT reported record gaming revenue.That has to do with investor education. The general investor just knows brand names. They have no clue how to look at a the balance sheet and income statements. THAT'S THE REASON MOST TRADERS FAIL. Learn to buy bargains and sell when fundamentals don't match price.The console launch is going to 20x profit? Oh wowand CPU's are not the bottleneck in gaming PC, its all about graphics cards.

People in this thread acting like Intel is the company of yester year and not the company struggling with innovation and having their market share taken brick by brick in the server space.

Death by a thousand cuts is how I describe Intel's future outlook. Still a good buy opportunity if they can turn it around.Apple doesn’t make up a lot of Intel business.Yes, Intel is moving to chiplet as well, that was definitely a smart move for AMD.RemindMe! 2 years "A civil discussion about AMD vs Intel"Well I agree with you there, and it explains their strong data center performance and why that growth might even continue for years and mask underlying long term weakness.Platform lock in will only take you so far. Intel is flailing right now with no end in sight. If Intel is still behind 5-10 from now Intels lead will vanish.Yeah, but that's the point.  There are a LOT of moving parts that make this sort of comparison difficult on PC with similar CPUs, ARM is going to be a whole different beast.> Reviews, custom satisfaction, reinforcement of the premium brand.

Not really what I was talking about.  You're doing a review, how do you show that the improvement in battery life is a result of the new CPU, and not the motherboard, ethernet/wifi, screen, USB, HDD/SSD, GPU, or the battery itself?

Apple has also made a number of changes that industry does not follow.  They're half the phone industry, but a niche player in the PC/Laptop industry.Let’s agree to disagree here. Wake me up when aws’s ARM instances are selling, :-)That supercomputer’s performance is driven by Nvidia chips, ARM or not does not make a difference.Are you a computer scientist because I really don't believe you have any idea what you're talking aboutBut it's in addition to server, desktop, HEDT, graphics, mobile wins.I applaud the nonstop wreckage you've dealt this AMD fanboy. When you show them analysis they shut the fuck up.No, but AMD is launching the Zen 2 APUs to increase OEM market share. This traditionally was a an area that Intel dominated in. But for cheap prebuilts with no dGPU now AMD has the edge with 4, 6, 8 core machines. These will be great for office machines, as AMD has good performance for the price. They should also have a hidden bonus, they can run memory faster than the chiplets so they may have a small boost in gaming with a dGPU. But that's to be seen.

Then AMD is launching Zen 3 CPUs without an iGPU. These should have 8 core CCXs, increased IPC. This should beat Intel in gaming. The 4 core single CCX 3300x already matches the 7700K. Zen 3 4700x should match or even surpass the 9900K in gaming.

Zen 3 will also come with a new generation of faster servers, maybe a Threadripper refresh (HEDT). Although AMD is so far ahead in HEDT that would be a victory lap. These are very high margin parts, compared to desktop and semi-custom.

AMD is also launching "Big Navi" that is rumored to be better than the current best GPU 2080Ti. But Nvidia is also launching something at the same time. So we'll have to see which one is going to be better. I predict Ampere will be faster, but more expensive. Big Navi will, however, increase margins.

Then in 2021 AMD launches Zen 3 mobile parts. Better gaming performance comes to gaming laptops where AMD is already tied with Intel in performance. AMD will sell more premium SKUs, and launch more SmartBoost combos with Navi 2 GPUs which will be better than any current laptops, but will have stiff Nvidia competition. But they will still sell a lot of Nvidia laptops with AMD CPUs in them!

Moving on, they will be making phone GPUs to compete with Adreno, have supercomputing wins, and increase console margins. Apparently consoles have terrible margins on launch (so 2020), but stay the same and sell for about the same the next year while manufacturing scales. TSMC is still what, in the second year of making 7nm? It will get cheaper, and yields will improve.

These are significant tailwinds for AMD. I would not be surprised if AMD doubled their top line within the next two years.There is more to a company than the Next quarters Earnings report. Intel just has a way of padding the earnings reports as it slowly sinks. Shortsightedness by Intel will destroy the company technologically first and financially later.I see people do this all the time, is this a bot or something?

|-|-|-|-|I think it also buys them time to solve their current process issues. Sure, it looks bad in the press, but a huge, huge part of sales is customer-client relations, and Intel still has the first mover bias there. It takes a lot to lose that.Platform lock in is a fixed cost in the short term that increases in the long term. Ignoring buyer irrationality, it only makes sense to change components when the marginal performance gain outweighs the cost of changing. If Intel remains as behind as it is now and computing power remains as valuable as it is now, that decision does not change. Intel has to lose ground or computing power has to become more valuable at a rate that *exceeds the increase in platform lock in*.No,  not really, not at all in fact.

Every generation of iPhones come with Apple's custom ARM designs, but it still gets compared to Qualcomm and Samsung chips when Android phones launch.

Comparisons include battery life, CPU benchmarks and performance using similar apps.

It isn't difficult at all.WAKE UPThe performance is driven by the Fujitsu A64FX ARM processor.Yes, and it will send you an email in X amount of time about the thread.  I like it for keeping track of things I found interesting, but have a time element, that I don't want to forget about.> Every generation of iPhones come with Apple's custom ARM designs, but it still gets compared to Qualcomm and Samsung chips when Android phones launch.

All three processors are ARM based, which is like comparing AMD to Intel.  Very different comparing ARM to x86.
  
> Comparisons include battery life, CPU benchmarks and performance using similar apps.

Right, but they're comparing the entire system at that point.  I agree with you that they talk about battery life, which is critical with a cell phone, but they seldom put it all on the CPU.  Further cell phone are much more uniform in their power drains than a PC.

Apple is going to release a laptop, not just a CPU.  It's going to have a number of differences that aren't just the CPU.  It's also going to be the GPU, RAM, HDD/SDD, Screen, Battery, Wifi/Ethernet, speakers, etc.  All those moving parts effect battery life and performance.**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

The 2008 crisis began in housing/real estate with little reaction in the stock market until banking and credit markets froze. That’s when unemployment climbed and the market tanked. 

So far in this crisis, we’ve seen unemployment grow but enhanced unemployment payments, eviction moratorium, business loans, and Fed support of credit market has kept things relatively calm. 

If during this time we had gotten control of virus transmission we’d be in good shape. But we still have widespread community transmission and all the unemployment and housing support are about to expire.2020 is the 2006 of 2008You can't speak of this crisis as thought it's already behind us.   The economic challenge has hardly even begun and the virus part is still getting worse by the week.

The market has held up because the gov't is basically paying the bills of the unemployed.  That isn't sustainable.   I don't know how it ends but it will end somehow.  That's the part that will probably be worse than 2008.2008 didn't happen overnight and it took a while for the extent of the problem to set in and the markets to react.

We're still not past this problem and have no idea what kind of damage will be done before it's over. Right now the economic impact has been in certain areas but it'll bubble up to other sectors pretty fast. 

I'm pretty optimistic long-term(5+ years out) but short term, I think it's a total crap shoot.1. Economic pressures haven’t hit the financial markets yet due to unprecedented government actions. Fed bought 3trillion and congress approved 3 trillion within weeks. The economy is certainly being backstopped for now. But the effects will be felt as soon as the fed and government puts their feet off the breaks. Or if the pandemic gets worse than it is now which is becoming more and more likely as fall/winter season approaches. 

2. Not being worried is actually pretty worrying. It’s normally good to be optimistic but in certain times of uncertainly it’s better to be wary than it is to be blindly hopeful. That’s how unexpected bad news can make a bad situation worse.

3. I cannot stress that we haven’t even begun to see the economic ramifications yet. Entire supply chains and industries will be drastically affected after the temporary period ends. Who knows how far the hospitality industry will come back. What will all those millions of people that rely on those jobs do after the pandemic ends if those jobs don’t come back? Government action seems like the only solution. But again this crisis will likely last years.2008 was a financial crisis. Of the financial news was gloomier. 

Covid is an economic crisis. You wan't gloom? Head to your local food bank or advertise an entry level job and watch the barrage of very over qualified people pin their hopes on you.Winter is coming1. The market is betting on a vaccine. The news of successful trials is good for the market.
2. When everything crashed this year, it was because we didn't know up from down. Now we've proven that while inconvenient, the economy will survive this. People will still shop and eat, albeit in modified format.😂he thinks the economic crisis already happened 😂2008 ended up being a financial crisis.  Of course it was scarier.  You had all the dollar/your retirement accounts will be worthless.  Gold to 5k, nay 8k.  For quite a while it felt hopeless as nobody wanted to do anything to fix the issues. 

If we had no PPP loans, unemployment checks, loans to the airlines, etc. this would feel much worse now too.It has barely started yet, I’m a Brit and October is going to be our crisis point, when the furlough scheme ends, and the unemployment that was put on ice kicks off. It’s also worth mentioning that it isn’t just about how bad the fall in the stats is, but also how much structural damage is done, a fall of twice the size that is easily undone with a V shaped recovery, and a collapse followed by flat growth, like 2008, are very different.I think the main reason for the optimism is because there was an actual economic collapse in 2008. Right now, there's a Covid health crisis and that is causing a 'temporary' economic crisis. Most of the people thing that everything will go back to normal once Covid is contained. The jobs lost will be regained, and there'll be minimal damages to the overall economy. The government has been printing endless money to make sure it doesn't turn into a full-blown economic collapse.

Also, there are more 'work-from-home' jobs now, so those people will feel a sense of job security.Wait till unemployment runs out for 30 million people...then it might start feeling worseI'm reading the comments and some of yall are gonna have a rude awakening come q4. if you think the whole world can go through something of this caliber and not have a few aftereffects you're fooling yourselvesI guess this is an unpopular opinion in this sub, but 2008 was way worse. The hole banking system was in risk of collapsing. I agree that we haven't seen the full extent of 2020 crisis, but I feel like at least the financial sector (backed by tremendous incentive packages worldwide) was much better prepared for this oneWas it worse because that was your first crisis that you lived through and now you are more prepared?

For brand new investors 2008 is something you read about and hear stories from older investors but right now OMG look whats happening to my portfolio!!!!!

keep in mind that "2008" took over a year till things stabalized in Spring 2009 market wise, though the bleeding of jobs was just starting.

We are only 4 months into Covid here in the US. Next spring we can see what happens and do more accurate comparisons.That's because it was a housing crisis. A good portion of the country knew someone that was losing their home.It has been worse since 2008 for 95% of the population. This is just a tipping point.The cards for "2008" started falling in 2007, but the reality of the impact on main street didn't reverberate through wall street until 2008...and even then McCain was running for president on the platform of "the fundamentals of the economy are strong." Then the bottom fell out in 2009. Job losses didn't begin to stem until later that spring, and even then it was just 'less job loss than 900k/mo.' 

We hit 25 million jobless claims in about 2 months in 2020, about 20% unemployment rate nationally. By comparison to 2008 that is INSANE. For reference, Obama visited Elkhart County, Indiana to tout his response - arguably the worst hit county in the nation...which hit 21.5% UE county-wide. Nationally it wasn't even remotely close to that figure (yay dependence on RV industry). As a public employee, this didn't catch up to us until 2011 when tax rev loss and idiotic austerity forced RIFs at schools nationwide. I was lowest on the totem pole in a dept of 11 that kept my job (#9).

With hindsight, February was the first sign of a downturn (even before COVID19). 

2008 was a year in the making. Do you know how you'll feel come March '21? How about a year from now? We are 6 mo in rn. If you're a public employee...watch out in 2023-24. At this point in "2008" it was still 2007 and nobody knew anything except 'gas is fucking expensive.'If you own a small business and you will feel it. They are forced to shutdown. Its not just financial sector in 08. Its everything. Even big public companies are on the line but they are borrowing cheaply from the fed and investors to stay float. The calm won't last long. USD will be the breaking point IMO.2020 isnt over yet. Earning are coming in now and unemployment benefits are about to run out. More people are about to be on the streets and not able to pay bills and rent and buy shit. 

It's not over. It's a slow spiral.>The covid crises is supposedly worse. All of the metrics we have so far seem to indicate that this is worse than 2008 by a longshot. But it just doesn't feel like it. The people in my life seem to be doing well. I don't sense the same fear and anxiety in news and media that I did in 2008. I don't feel overly worried about my long term financial situation. And I don't fear the economic future of the country.

By what metrics? 2008 was essentially a housing crash and, well, most people live in houses. It's also where most people have the vast majority of their equity. In other words, people's net worths were decimated in a very short amount of time, not to mention the big banks and financial firms.

Nothing like that has or is happening now. What we have now is an unemployment issue, but the vast majority of families still hold equity in their houses, which have remained stable.People were losing homes in 2008 which is why it was worse. Housing bubbles are devastating to families.We're still in the denial stageim pretty sure over 1k people a day dying is a lot worse.

&#x200B;

the difference this time around is that the gop has the presidency, so theyre not obstructing aid, like they did with obama and the years that followed.It could be because last time the market went down the toilet. Once the stock market crashes it will feel worse.Like we're not going to have an even bigger economic crisis this fall/winter... Stock market more disconnected than ever.

It's 2020, the perfect year for the bubble to burstWith all the stimulus payments and furloughing going on the shit hasn't actually hit the fan yet. The insolvency phase is about to start. Think of it like a looney tunes cartoon where we've run off the end of a cliff but we're not falling just yet as we still haven't looked downthe credit system was doing fine before the pandemic. 

2008 was a credit crisis

2020 is now an income crisis

it might feel ok now, but the economy is teetering on the brink of total decimation unless the government figures out a comprehensive plan to mediate the fall out... 

this might be worse than 2008In 2008 the Fed increased their balance sheet by $3T over 4 years. In 2020 the Fed increases their balance sheet by $3T over 2 weeks. Don’t underestimate the effect that can have.It isn’t over yet..In 2008 if you look at the stock charts there was a decline then a bump / plateau for about six months after the bailouts then a crash. This time there was a crash then massive bailouts and market manipulation resulting in a stock boost. I suspect a crash before year end as the optimism of the populace is replaced with the reality of the situation. The caveat is if the government drives inflation so high prices could stay the same as money is worth severely less. But I don’t think even the government can cause us to ignore reality forever. Im trying to think of a significant difference between them other than COVID.

 In 2008 it was the public who became overindebted when their house equity collapsed. But in 2020 it's the Fed shouldering the debt by printing more money and giving it out helicopter style.


 As an aside, isn't it cute when the party of staunch anti-Keynesianism gets in power and become the biggest Keynesians in the history of the world?


 Now add back in COVID and people are wary of debt and not spending for economic and public health reasons.

 Consumer facing businesses are spending more: More for labor, more for cleaning/social distancing renovations while not being able to handle the same customer volume.

 So: Business costs are rising. Consumer demand is down. Government debt is rising at a staggering rate.






 I don't know how all of this will shake out but it wont be good.what's weird is that this is way worse than 2008 and everybody seems to think it's nothing, that's the scary partAmerica ran a higher budget deficit in June alone than the entire value of the TARP bailout. Add to that however many trillions of QE we have had since March, and the fact that the Fed is literally trapped at 0% interest for the foreseeable future and this bullshit is held together with spit and duct tape.

The only difference between now and then is the GOP Prez needs a good "economy" (read: stock market) to avoid slaughter in November. Thus the actions they are taking above at magnitudes that they NEVER would have gone with under Obama.

But if Biden wins and Mitch keeps the Senate, look the fuck out below. It will be 2008 all over again and budgets and austerity and fiscal responsibility will be all the GOP suddenly cares about again (after driving the country off a fiscal cliff for the 2nd consecutive GOP presidential administration, of course).Bear Stearns collapsed in March 2008. 
Lehman Brothers didn’t bankrupt until September of 2008. 

Between March and September no one thought there will be a financial crisis. 

We’re just in beginning of Covid Depression, the calm before the storm.Because the fed is printing money to support business and ppp loans are given out to smaller corporations . 2008 was bad because of bank collapse but government intervened with bailout packages . They did now before the collapse started . Employees are still laid off because of less revenue . Things are gonna go to shit before it feels normalI mean it just started...the whiplash will come to make you “feel” it down the road so don’t worry2008 was a financial crisis. The financial crisis has not started...yetA few big differences:

1. The extra $600 per week of unemployment benefits does a LOT to take the sting and urgency out of losing your job. Many people are making more while unemployed than they did while working, which means they're going to be less likely to be panicked or depressed. There wasn't anything like that in the aftermath of 2008; there were *extended* benefits (whereas you'd normally be cut off after six months, extended UE pushed it to twelve) but the dollar value of those benefits wasn't increased.

2. Earlier in the crisis--to a lesser extent now--the feeling was that coronavirus would be a temporary blip, that everything would go back to normal in a few months once the virus was eliminated. Which meant that if you lost your job in March you could tell yourself a comforting story that bonus unemployment would easily tide you over until you went back to work in June or whenever. Less stress, more optimism versus 2008 when if you lost your job, it felt like it could be forever.

3. The Federal Reserve REALLY got ahead of a potential financial crisis and nipped it in the bud. For about two weeks in the middle of March there was a very real possibility we'd see a credit crisis (even agency RMBS was blowing out, which is... weird) but the Fed acted quickly and decisively to stop it. Whereas in 2007-2008 it was allowed to fester to the point of causing near economic collapse during that fateful week in Sept. 2008.I work at a hospital and we're watching unit after unit be converted into COVID wards. We are increasingly short staffed as staff members fall ill.

 I took care of a coworker who was on high flow oxygen after working with her just a few weeks ago in seemingly perfect health.

Meanwhile, the people in our large city continue to resist all mask orders because they think it's all fake or not a big deal.In my opinion, the real economic hurt just isn't here yet. I work with a local school system, and here's what's on the horizon:

1. Hundreds of thousands if not millions of parents that cannot work because K-12 education is closed and they can't afford childcare. For those school systems that don't close, get ready for huge flare ups of COVID which will shut down state and local economies. The idea that six year olds will social distance isn't based on reality--especially if their parents believe it's a hoax.
2. Huge swaths of childcare centers closed and won't reopen after the spring fallout of COVID-19.
3. In many counties and municipalities, particularly in rural America school systems are the largest employers (including where I work). Going full online means no need for bus assistants, instructional aids, custodians, reduced capacity for childcare workers, secretaries... they're all looking at layoffs. 
4. AND they're all looking at layoffs as expanded UI is going away. No/reduced income for the whole fall is not going to make for a great holiday shopping season, which is often annual stimulus.

The fall is going to be tough, but people will have E-FMLA under the CARES act for a few months and basic UI. However, if there is not a widely available vaccine by January and Congress doesn't pump a whole lot more money into the economy everything is going to totally fall apart.They hadn’t invented the money printer meme yet in 2008. That’s literally the only reason you feel like things are better off right now. And, by the way, this strategy is the definition of kicking the can further down the roadWe are not "there" yet IMO. things didn't feel so bad in, say, early-mid 2007 (or even early 2008).

we are what, 4-5 months into this? Patience, young one.Helps when fed jumps in right away with hundreds of billions of cash payouts.We aren’t in the crash.That's because the banking crisis hasn't started yet.

What until long term rates are so low all the banks are in crisis again.The question is...

Are we in 2008 yet?

A lot hinges on what happens when stimulus and whether another bill is passed.

The stock market is fine. For now...You obviously don't know someone that has DIED of covid. 140,000 people have died, and you have the gall to say that a financial recession was worse. The two years don't belong in the same sentence, much less actually compared.Everyone learned a lot from 08.  The government and fed are doing a better job keeping everything stable.This is a slow train wreck, whose financial effects have been delayed by financial stimulus.It hasn’t even started yet. Things are going to collapse in November regardless of who wins the electionJust an FYI, this is significantly worse than 2008. The only reason you’re not feeling it yet is because there haven’t been evictions. Those should start soon because the eviction blocks are running out. The CARES act is also almost over. 

Shit is going to get exponentially worse - save your cash.Age brings experience.2008 during the stock crash, our lives were largely unaffected.  2010 - 2011, however, was really bad, we were furloughed, many, many friends left town because there was no work or they were trying to get out of mortgages that were twice the value of the home they owned, we had tons of empty storefronts.  I don’t think our city actually totally recovered before this hit.Yeah absolutely, 2008 felt hopeless for so many people.

2020 is bad but it’s not on the same level of economic losses and unemployment2020 has a hope that it is only temporary though things could get a lot worse if it continues to be prolonged, EI runs out, mortgage/other deferments end etc.You're right. Government assistance is helping greatly. A lot of the things I thought would happen, stock market and housing declines, people selling cars and toys( boats, RVs) contractors struggling for work haven't happened yet where I live in Arizona. Many people are putting in pools, people doing renovations, building new homes/condos, commercial warehouses. Housing prices still high due to lack of inventory/availability. I think we may see this in the next 3-6 mos as business restart layoffs, with more bankruptcies, but who knows.Market is being artificially inflatedRemindme! 12 monthsYour forgetting how long it too to get to that point. Wait a few more weeks and then the gloom will set in. As we find ourselves in this impossible work/school quandary. 

If the monthly payments come it might stave it off for a bit but only till inflation/deflation starts taking hold.Everybody got direct financial aid from fed. That’s the difference... The pain has been delayed after the election.We're in an economy on life support. It will eventually start to disappear then the real wreckage will be seen.I don't think we've seen the full effect from COVID yet. Bars and restaurants are still most closed here at least. Some can operate with 25% capacity or with outdoor seating. Bars/nightclubs are closed. Music venues are closed. Movie theaters closed. Larger events that bring in money to cities canceled. I'm sure there's much more than that I'm not even aware of. We're going into month 4-5 months of this so far with cases ticking up again. Who knows what the fall/winter will bring and an actual resurgence of it. Small businesses are hurting. Lots of people on unemployment. Yet, we're just printing away to make things temporarily right.

The difference with this and with 2008 is that 2008 was a "real" crisis. Meaning, it was a perfect storm of a lot of financial things coming together and going nuts. It didn't necessarily have an "end date" or timeline, thus uncertainty. Honestly, if the Fed didn't step in then, we probably would have ended up a lot worse. The cascading effect of mortgages, banks, defaults, etc.

COVID's different. We generally can see there's probably a 2 year life span of this (up for debate), but it's probably going to come in waves, then taper off. At least emotionally, people can process that more. Unfortunately with COVID, poorer people are more effected and those with higher level jobs seem less effected. Whereas in 2008, everyone was effected and you could argue wealthier people even more.Give it 6 months...That’s bc the republican gov is choosing to print more money (the trillion dollar stimulus package) and inflate the US dollar, devaluing it, rather than have us suffer a recession. 

Notable countries like Germany, Venezuela, Brazil, etc also went this rout. 

This is why the stock market is going “up” with no earnings. There’s more money in it than there was before.Thats because it was. This is overhyped nonsenseIt is tough to feel pain when the govt is spending an additional $3 Trillion a quarter. There will be pain when govt spending declines or if it turns to inflation.I agree, but this isn’t over yet.There was no Robinhood in 2008This is the difference between a recession and recession combined with a financial crisis. Banks are healthy and well capitalized. We have seen unprecedented fiscal stimulus and monetary easing. Most publicly traded businesses have been able to borrow plenty of capital to survive another 6-18 months of crisis.2008 felt worse because 2020 ain't over yet. We are nowhere close to the end of the pain.Maybe it’s because you’re older / at a different stage in life?It’s because the people who can own stocks are the least affected by this crisis.  Therefore, many are out of touch with the reality of it.  The housing crisis affected all wealths and was more spread out.  This affect low-income blue collar workers the most.  And if you are in those fields, for example I am a dancer, it is absolutely terrifying.  The performing arts industry is completely dead.It all depends if this is over or not. Bottom took 16 months in '08. If this is all we're getting this time then no question that was a lot worse.Given we are subscribed to r/investing the “feeling” is going to be an echo chamber of less effected individuals (more disposable income and more successful ppl generally).

Subscribe to other channels where the service industry is plentiful or the SMBs that are bankrupt or running at 25% and in the midst of a forebearance and you start to see more of the panic.

r/personalfinance as of late has had posts in the past couple weeks that have me tearing up.  And that’s just the brave ones that aren’t too embarrassed to ASK for help...Wait til the Fed/stimulus candy high runs outThe reality of this has not hit yet.Well, it hasn't really started yet.2008 hit everyone, particularly middle class homeowners and those with stable, well paying jobs and retirement funds. This year the damage has been isolated to those in low skill, low pay positions. People who rent, work low paying service jobs, generally live paycheck to paycheck and have very little savings.

The effect this has had on most middle class folks with skilled jobs is that they now mostly work from home which results in them saving money, spending more time with family and overall a decent increase in quality of life. People (with money to invest) aren't fearful because they're generally better off now than they were before COVID. 

On the other hand people who were struggling before COVID had the bottom drop out from under them.2008: governments acted late, nearly by 12 months  before approving financial packages, and by then we were deep into recession.

This year: Financial packages came out large and early. And also, with possibility of additional financial packages as needed.The inflation we're going to experience might make you feel worse.

There is a lot of profit taking going on, at the expense of the American public that is inflating the bubble.The difference is that the people immediately impacted in 2020 are typically lower middle class. Bartenders, Servers, retail employees. Entertainment venues.Buy gold. Covid has made me a wealthy man.The media is too busy hyping the health crisis to bother drumming up any economic hysteria.I was 28 back then and I didn't even notice about the collapse.  I wasn't into the stock market back then either, just my 401k.It’s because the US is juiced up with stimulus money, once it’s over doom and gloom will start.This is an excellent example of privilege and how it plays a role in worldview. The US in particular is in fairly significant shambles, but if you have a stable job and income, it doesn't feel as bad. I think it's important to stay aware of everything going on in the world right now - it's really really bad2008 more blue collar people lost jobs.  This time it's more gig and service industry.  I think we are still a few months away from seeing the true economic implications though.  Remember the great recession started in 2007 and you still remember it as 2008.I think people were more honest in 2008. If things were bad, they called them out like that. Nowadays, anything you say that is unpopular will not get retweeted or posted to Reddit, hence no one will know about it. For that and other reasons, you just can't say something unpopular. I don't know why it's okay to spread fear about COVID but not the financial markets, but I'm sure it's related to politics somehow.Wait for it.... reality hasn’t hit yet.  As soon as the economy corrects, we’re proper fucked.You really need to caveat this by saying from a financial perspective. At least half a million people didn’t die in 2008This is my analysis,

You can check Dow Jones/S&P 500 for example, in 2008  the decrease was around 60%, while around 30% for 2020. This is why some people have fear of a second wave/dip. Some industries benefited from COVID, which helped absorbed some of the losses , but then The fed started printing and created a bubble/inflation.



I mean just take a look at inflation rate/unemployment rate, then take a look at the markets. It doesn't make sense at all. So to be safe, expect another hit from now until election.I am not optimistic buying some of these stocks at current prices. When they dip then I will feel better. Market correction is needed.It was worse.This time we have motherlodeWhen the world gets bad enough, the good go crazy, but the smart go bad.During 2019 they threw the switch and we transitioned from real life to virtual world. We are now living in a reality show where nothing matters. Money just comes out of thin air.Not feeling worried is exactly when you should be worried.

Theres a massive debt bubble about to burst.  The fed kept it going so the 1% can get out before the rest.

Most of the middle class are financing their lifestyle though debt rather than wage gain.  This debt financing has reached its peak as we are close to the 0 bound along the yield curve.

Without stimulus the house of cards fall.  But the government cant stimulate endlessly.

It may feel fine but economy is worse than the great financial crisis. Yoh will feel it once stimulus stops.2008 was like breaking a leg whereas 2020 feels like a we've developed multiple cancerstotally agree. I think this sub's demographic are mostly younger where in 2008 they may still be in school so there may be some biased view thereYou are lucky that you don’t know anyone affected and/or getting your news from bad sources if you don’t hear any fear or anxietyAre we really having this discussion? *How many people died in 2008?*Let me know if you feel the same way in 6 months. The worst is yet to comeA lot of pussies who ain't buying the dip in here.Unlimited liquidity has prevented a repeat of the credit crunch in 2008. It's still early days for this crisis, I think we are seeing a retail driven stock bubble as a result of the fed propping up the bond market. I think there will be another crash and it will be following a lot of foreclosures and bankruptcies.🙄TLT dropped 0.5% overnight. There's hope[removed]The fed stepped in way earlier this time.  In 2008 they waited until the last second to get involved.We'll see what happens in the next couple of month, because it looks like this all could possibly get a lot worse, but I do think there is something to be said about the mentality of people during Covid vs 2008. In 2008 I just remember so many people having this sense of hopelessness. With Covid, I think a lot of people still have this idea that things are eventually going to return to normal and kind of just recover. I am not sure that is an accurate assumption to make, but it does seem to be one that a lot of people are making.It ain't over yet.YES..... I think it was because there were not this many people 
Plus I think margin and options accounts were not prevalent 
Also everytime you would buy you would pay a fee. So it discouraged traders to trade offten.

I sometime see myself buy 50 shares and then 20 shares and then 10 shares and then 20 share all of the same stock but in limit orders spread to save a few centsMid March sort of felt that way. But I agree today doesn'tPurely from an economic perspective, 2008 was and will go down in history as being the  "worse" of the two. This economic 'crash' was artificially mandated. People are chomping at the bit to start working again, but they are not allowed to. In that way, just about any other recession is genuinely harder for the average American, as they want to work but simply cannot find employment, and that's far more disheartening (by my estimation, anyway). Right now, through the benefits of technology, many folks in the middle-class are able to stay employed. Unskilled and cheap work is suffering the most, because, simply put, what they do cannot be done remotely or without brick-and-mortar stores and without physical customers. That said, the makeup demographics of unemployment during a recession like 2008 is far more evenly spread. The path to recovery for this economic crash is far more linear and far less complex, and recovery will begin the moment that the pandemic status is removed from our popular lexicon, for better or for worse with regards to people's safety.simple answer, ‘08 was an immediate shock. the nature of this problem is that itll stay w us longer, the issues will grind on until we solve it w a vaccine, therapeutics, or herd immunity.

think: being in a car crash, and getting sent to the ER
vs
being diagnosed w stage 4 cancer..I don't think the real recession has hit yet. There is no point in cutting the public stimulus while the economy is still crashing. We are flattening the economic crash curve here. Currency devaluation and overvalued stocks is going to cause a crash, but the fed wants the market crash to be disjointed from the economic lows. My guess is once the economy starts recovering, the markets will crash.2008 was drawn out with financial institutions falling like dominos and unconventional monetary policy made it's foray for the first time and anything fiscal had Congress haggling over it.

2020 the central bank stepped in fast, we had an idea about the playbook and the federal government provided liquidity to businesses and households  directly too so it was short. 

2008 was a fascinating case study of intervention.

2020 will be an equally facitnating if not more facinating case study of centeral bank and government intervention.If you're soley talking about the markets maybe?

Buf are you forgetting the millions of people unemployed, the hundreds of thousands of people dying across the globe, the BBC have estimated (here in the UK) that the loss in school time for children and teens will lead to years of harm for the [UK economy](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-53514564).

There are so many layers to this and people need to be more alert and not so naive thinking because they've made a bit of money or the stock market isn't in hell that the wider economy is doing swell.

Stock Market != Wider Economy.Saving this post for a later date..The worst hasn't happened yet..people are getting by because of stimulus checks/600 a week PUA payments and bans on evictions...those programs can't last foreverI'm torn. I'm hoping the worst part is behind us, but part of me believes this is only the beginning. I'm praying that part is wrong :(RemindMe! 6 monthsI think the difference is there's more political unity now, because everyone recognizes this crash and crisis is not a result of irrational exuberance and a Minsky moment on debt, but the result of a pandemic and resulting government-mandated economic shutdown. 

It also helps that the traditionally anti-spending party has their guy in the White House, and controls at least one chamber in Congress, meaning it's in their interest to prop up the economy ahead of elections. 

But I think it's mostly the former- people recognize this isn't the time for Austrian economics, it's time for wartime economics.This is a natural disaster, 2008 wasn't. There is a clear catalyst to things getting back to normal ie. a vaccine, 2008 there wasn't.Wait when inflation and new taxes hit you in the face = that will be the price you will pay. Not today, not tomorrow, but after some time.We have more systems in check to prevent it from collapsingRemember 2 things.  First, this economic collapse is hitting the service sector hard because of lock downs or partially lockdowns. Most service sector employees are lower paid. Second, Unemployment Insurance has consisted of a $600 Federal portion plus whatever the state pays, which is about $400 on an average nationwide. So many of these lower end workers have actually seen a pay increase.

The $600 Federal portion stops at the end of this month, in one week.  It doesn't like look at this point like it's going to be renewed. If not, we will then feel the full impact of the lockdowns. The pain has only been postponed.You're forgetting about the $4T (and growing) in stimulus that's been injected into the economy in a couple months. A lot of what's been done this time around is a direct product of memories of 2008. The Fed is back-stopping corporate bonds. Think about that for a minute.2008 learned us that deflation is very bad.  We have avoided that for as long as we can see into the future.Major difference between 2020 and 2008 is credit.

The banking industry and a lot of financial institutions were in serious trouble in 2008.   The housing industry was really affected. 

In 2020, that's not the case.  

I will say though we maybe forming a housing bubble here.[removed]No way. Maybe in certain pockets of the world it might feel like that, but 2008 was mostly a US thing. It barely had any impact at all where I live. But 2020 is *global*. Can’t escape it anywhere. Even in places where the virus itself has been well controlled, the economic impacts are massive.Just wait.[removed]As long as you can borrow at very low interest rates and pay the minimum the economy will seem fine.I agree, but I think there is a psychological component to the 2008 crisis compared to now.

This is something that is caused by a pandemic that we presume will go away. Whatever havok is wreaked will be rebuilt in the aftermath. In a year or two, we should be in the process of making everything alright. 

We sort of know the death rates and many of the metrics surrounding what happens if you get it. The timeline is somewhat finite. The outcome (from a being dead perspective) is relatively foreseeable *so far*. 

In 2008, I feel like the timeline and scope of the problem was much more of an unknown for a much longer period. In fact, people still were talking about the impacts and things that were still plaguing our economy right up until Covid... or at least until Trump was elected. 

Death is scary. Unforeseeable and unknown doom for long periods of time is scarier.Worst is yet to comeRemindme! 12 monthscash money ain't dried up yet... 
(except coins aren't circulating much)

jes' wait.Wait until China dumps their treasuries.I'm pretty sure the 140,000 people dead in the united states would disagree. Or their families.

2008 was more heavily economic. We didn't have sick and dying people. This time the markets are actually doing pretty well. Hell I went to go buy a house last month and people were bidding 20-30k higher than the asking price.


Revisit this in 12 months and see how 2021 starts out. If the government can keep going brrrrrrrrrrr  we will be ok. When that stops we will see the real economic impact. We aren't there yet, 2020 is only half over.Why wouldn't you feel that way? A quick look at the S&P 500 chart shows it clearly was.Look I’m no financial guru butJust give it some time. Its just beginningRich whales are not willing to take losses from March crash, so they must artificially maintain the market and pump it back up. Once it will reach desired levels, they will safely take out their investments and let the apocalypse begin.No really?Winter is coming. I hope you are right but I feel that we haven't seen the worse yet.Well, this is barely starting. This is a marathon, not a sprint. My guess is that this will be worse, but I hope you're right.We all recognize the endgame this time around.   We can fix the issue with a vaccine and we all believe this will occur in the near future late 2020 / early 2021.  2008 had a lot more fear / opaqueness, no once clearly knew what and when the keystones would fall for the event to blow over.well because the price hasn't dumped. If spy was at 180 right now you'd be feeling not very bueno.Think of 2008 as a burning building, and 2020 as a crack in the foundation. A crack that currently seems minor, but say an earthquake hit! The building would need to be torn down and restructured. 

Analogies aside, it all boils down to liquidity. What got us out of 2008 was quantitative easing, but the government did not put this into effect for quite sometime. This time, Uncle Sam loaded his weapon, and started blowing off shots right at the start. Seems to have worked right? Like a cure for recession, why doesn’t every government do this? 

Because they don’t have reserve-currency status, the USD does. Given that the oil-trade and much of the world’s debt is USD-denominated, it can only be dealt in USD, leading to significant demand for the dollar. This is one of many (but is the biggest) reason why we can print so much money without seeing any negative effect... in the short term. Long-term this destabilizes the dollar and adds to the growing case being made for why the world needs to move away from the USD. Without reserve-currency status, we’re left with massive asset-inflation, and old Sam’s printer being out of juice, we’ll have to stomach the effects of a recession greater than anything we have seen before. This is the “earthquake” in our analogy. Look up the “Taper Tantrum” to see the effects of just a small decrease in government provided liquidity. Short and simple, liquidity is crack, and the market is hoarding it away in its crack-den like a squirrel. Ever tried to take away an addict’s vice? Doesn’t end pretty. 

Also interesting to note, the stock-market used to essentially be an indicator for the state of the economy. This is no longer the case, we’re falling into a Cold War with China, and the stock-market has now become the primary weapon in the world’s most expensive dick-swinging contest. 

Nobody knows for sure where this will lead us, anyone that claims otherwise is full of shit. Could actually be very beneficial in the mega-long-run assuming we don’t implode. But the journey there? Undoubtedly will be very painful.In 2008 we had at least a resemblance of a free market. This time around the Federal Reserve is running the printing press in overdrive and nationalizing the markets by directly buying bonds.I feel good badadada da daFo real tho the banks and financial system are strongYes, but then you have all the other countries in the world buying Chinese goods.Long story short, we are used to it. Few years down the road another one of those "once in a generation" event will most likely happen, and we will all feel... meh. This is our reality now.In 2008 we were on the verge of a global economic meltdown. The entire financial sector collapsed. We're nowhere near that level of danger in the short term. The long term consequences of all this are unclear and obviously not priced in.We didn't have UBI in 2008 like we do in 2020 ;) I'm referring, of course, to the $600 a week the unemployed are getting todaybecause it wasEye of the storm.I lost my business in 2008 and never recovered so I agree, but I'm probably biased.crazy?  2008, my retirement accounts dropped 40%

&#x200B;

this year... i couldnt even stomach looking at them ,  so imagine my surprise when i finally take a peek through squintedeyes and see that my account is at an all time high.I suppose it depends on what you mean by "things."  In 2008, we had a jarring, abrupt transfer of paper wealth.  It was basically an accounting crisis.  Banks lost money.  Whoop de doo. In 2020, we have a protracted pandemic that is literally crippling and killing hundreds of thousands in this country alone, not to mention the rest of the world, and, as a result, has caused both the supply of and demand for many goods and services to evaporate almost overnight (air travel, tourism, hotels, rental cars, sit-down dining, theater, sporting events, most types of group entertainment, to name just a few). Many people who work in this areas face long term unemployment.  They are now contributing nothing to the economy.  To make matters worse, we have no choice but to support those who are unemployed (or underemployed) with unsustainable debt, on top of the already unsustainable debt we had been carrying for half a generation now.  I would say the overall economy had been getting worse and worse for years even before COVID.  Sure, the markets have continued to grow as the federal government has continued to subsidize them since 2008. But it's just created bigger rift between haves and have nots, concentrating wealth in fewer and fewer hands.  If you're FAANG or a big bank, I guess I can see how 2020 is not quite so bad as 2008.  But for most people have or will soon be affected by unemployment, inflation, and the general economic stagnation, I would expect 2020 to be much worse.The worse from this hasn’t even gotten close to landing yet and they aren’t talking about it nearly as much in the news because this one is going to be worse and they don’t want to also cause a panic. 

This is gonna either cause prices to go way way up from inflation or they will have to stop giving out any the money which will cause riots right now. 

Wait till people have no job now, being evicted cause they can’t pay rent, can’t get even enough food because meat and veggies are going to get way more expensive. 

All of that will affect the greater economy a ton more and the cycle gets a next step worse. 

They’re trying to hold the ship together long enough to get to the election and then they will be more honest and deal with the fall out. 

It’s gonna get bad.Well I mean the fed is dumping trillions and prooping up the stock market.  Should be interesting what happens after extended covid benefits run out and such.  Lost my career in 2008 to the housing crash.   Got into the trades and seem to still have a job so it seems better this time around.It's not a fair comparison, comparing impacts of 2008 to the beginnings of 2020. 

But 2008 the fed took slower to response. Powell is printing like there's no tomorrow.everybody downvote this manI was in 8th grade. I had no options at all, let alone stock.2008 was worse.   Bush just finished breaking the world. The global banking industry fell apart and everyone being laid off was being laid off permanently.  This time around the economy is supposedly "good," we're just battling a virus and people laid off are more often led to believe it's temporary.  This time all we need is a vaccine. Last time, we didn't know what the hell hit us.In 2008, there was a fear of the entire financial system collapsing, including a run on the banks and complete loss of capital due to massive leveraging. I remember it very clearly as I got a call from my father telling me to turn on CNBC on Sunday evening to look at futures. My girlfriend at the time was like WTF (because we were watching a movie), but then she started calling her parents too. I was not affected at all by the crash because I had just started grad school, and all of the lost money in equity was quickly made up by leveraged ETFs. I started investing later that next year and did very well.

This year was not a financial problem but an exogenous event and a political/leadership problem in the US. The feeling was never that there would be the same kind of collapse unless payments began to be missed (which could still happen in principle if things are not propped up into the fall). Always the effects on everyday life lag behind market moves.The market/rich dgaf about poor people dying or losing their jobs. Now if BAC was in danger of going bankrupt. Sad but true.2008 felt great right up until it didn't.The covid crisis, is definitely worse.

&#x200B;

Active misdirection and refusal to acknowledge problems from the top.Ok, here is the difference, I think we are in the middle of a forced paradigm shift, things were already trending more digital, this Covid-19 outbreak will accelerate that trend.

Whereas in 2008 because the banks were affected directly, it hurt just about anyone trying get lines of credit, (which is just about every business) that right now is what the Federal Reserve is getting a chance to slow play and HOPEFULLY avoid a repeat.  Which to me is why this doesn't "FEEL" as bad.  We still have credit markets working, (for the time being at least).

I get the civil unrest and all, but let's be honest that's always there in some way, shape, or form.  So I wouldn't get caught up and let that be the doomsday instrument.  However something does need to be done with the real wages, but that's a whole different arguement.

I figure much less in the travel and food related industries for obvious reasons at least for the next few years, (2-3).

Also I think those travel dollars will likely get reallocated into different sectors, so people are home more now, I can see home remodels, purchases / upgrades to homes happening, new home electronics, furnishings, appliances, etc.

What if people work from home more permanently because of this?  Office space in the home, even moving to lower cost of living areas could see a boost and conversely large over priced cities would see a decline.  Conversely companies can spend less on office space.

I also tend to think at least 60-75% of jobs will come back within a few years (2-7), granted they will shift fields / needs.  Following the trends I mentioned.

Like I said, I see a HUGE paradigm shift.  Which means some companies that were positioned well before this are going to do EXTREMELY well (Amazon, MSFT, Cisco) while others who can't / won't adapt (All the retailers that are HEAVILY store traffic dependent) are going to do EXTREMELY poorly.probably the length of time it took to overcome 2008 had an effect.I don't think we've got rock bottom yet, everyone still has money in their pocket and a place to live. Once this starts to unwind you should ask yourself the same questions.That’s probably because 2008 seemed to hit a broad spectrum regardless of social class quite quickly. The economic struggles of today have largely impacted the lower and lower middle class thus far....but there are rumors to be another crash in a few months which will impact everyone. The stimulus can’t prop it all up forever. Things will get worse...much worse.If stores were empty right now. I think everyone would feel more pressure. That's how it felt when everyone started panic buying during the beginning of lockdowns. People feel left out and their insecurities of having less creates an abnormal stress.Since 2008 crash happened, we are more prepared for something like this to happen again.It ain't over yet1. This is self-inflicted. Any economic troubles are a result of the lockdown, so we're basically saying we'll sacrifice short term economic health in order to save lives. 2008 was a result of overleverage and systemic economic collapse. 

2. We're using many of the tools the Fed discovered in 2008; the actions taken back then were unproven, so nobody really knew if it would work or if it would have bad side effects (I remember a lot of people saying that QE should result in hyperinflation; it didn't).

3. When big business fail, it is noteworthy and seems catastrophic; when small businesses fail, people generally don't notice, even though it is sad.We know what hit us this time around, we know what could fix it, and there’s a rough timeline.Well, the covid impact has been muted due to the government saying nobody could get evicted, get ready for that happening over the next couple of months.I was in banking in 2008, and I'm in the event industry now.    
   
both feel very similar, but this one is worse on the streets by far.okI read the news and hear about all the bad news and talks of worst recession in a century. 

Then i go to my local estate agent and houses are getting sold within days. 

People are doing fine. The lower class have always had it hard, nothing new there. The rest are doing fine. 

Everything is open now so once the furlough scheme ends in a few months everyone will be on their wages.2008 kept dragging on and on.  at least now we don't question the fundamentals -- back then we capitulated on thatListen to peter Schiff on joe Rogan and try to be optimistic. I’m not saying that I agree with everything he says, but it’s pretty gloomy.its called politicsPersonally I'm horrified. Maybe your friends and family are already wealthy. But for anyone working a minimum wage job or an "essential" job where they are constanly exposed to risk of joblessness and illness without decent healthcare, it is a nightmare.Honestly I think it’s the fact that we’ve already been through a 2008 is why it isn’t as bad. More or less people were a bit more prepared and if they’ve already gone through it they generally know what to expect. Also I’ve seen a lot more articles on people who’ve been through the 2008 crisis giving sources and advice to help people not loose everything they have. Also the fact that so much is going on it’s hard to really see the whole picture in terms of how bad it is.No as others have said: 

2008 was bad for everyone. 

2020 is gonna be much worse for most of us.Why are you all so negative about the market going up? Seriously though.2008 Banks shit the bed. 2020 the ordinary worker is affected. Macro economically it was worse in 2008. Although you can’t buy jobs, you can flood the streets with cash and gamble with it professionally. Big money has no problem with this.Quantitative easingWe haven't been through the worst yet. S&P predicts defaults will be up, and we haven't really seen any yet, which implies that there is still some time for cash to burn and then they will go belly up.How the fuck did we survive 1918?Maybe you’re not worried because you’re in a privileged situation rn sir.The 2008 SPY low brought the market back to levels not seen since 1997, a whole 11 years of progress in the markets reversed.

The Covid Crash brought us back to levels not seen since...2016, a whole 4 years and it only took 2 months to get there and back to nearly all time highs. The rally from March lows felt like shit because everyone thought it was a fakeout. If SPY was still in the low 200 range (or lower), we wouldn't be feeling so great.2008 was like the heart stopped pumping blood to the rest of the body. 2020 is more like stubbing your toe.My jobs haven’t been effected and most people I know simply worked from home. For the white collar middle class it’s been life as usual, but with less travel time.  

For lower wage earners, they haven’t been working but have more money than they’ve ever earned from unemployment.

So the economy, as a whole, is mostly fine, with the exception of tourism.  But the US as a whole does not rely on tourism for a large chunk of GDP.

Now, can it come crashing down?  Yes.

If lower income jobs still don’t reopen after July and no bills get passed the lower income folks are screwed, and have very little savings to fall on.

This then will have a domino effect on consumers, small businesses, and the large businesses that sell to them, so eventually even big tech like Apple or Microsoft could get effected in a long recession.

So it really depends on if all the states will shut down after this second wave, and if they are willing to sustain it until end of year or even longer.  That could finally push the US over the edge.The people in congress and government in general are a lot dumber now than 2008, and more reckless now that the measures in 2008 worked more or less. Their nonchalance is reflected in markets which spreads the complacency to retail investors like us. There may not be some crash but things are decidedly different now. You don’t go back to normal when we just lost more Americans than were lost in WWI and we printed over 20% of annual GDP from thin air. I would stay in the market as that is likely where we will continue to see the first effects of inflation (which may arguably already be present) but I wouldn’t bet the entire farm on the US of global economy from bouncing back. Maintaining the status quo but with extreme caution is the way to go
ImoIdk man, I was 6Just wait. Show is coming...What goes down comes up long term :)Hindsight only works after the fact. We're still in the thick of this one.Wait.It's not over yet [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/alistair-darling-we-were-two-hours-from-the-cashpoints-running-dry-2245350.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/alistair-darling-we-were-two-hours-from-the-cashpoints-running-dry-2245350.html) 

Here's an article from an average British newspaper where the man who was chancellor in 2008 (he ran the eonomy and was the second most powerful person in the country) says that we were were two hours away from the banking system freezing up and ATMs running out of money. The guy is as boring as hell and not remotely prone to over-dramatising.

I feel like the beginning of covid was at least as alarming for me. Maybe the scale of possibilities made government intervention inevitable, but half of the population being stuck at home unable to work or pay their bills could surely surely collapsed our economies and socieities. We've now moved beyond that to the point where the risks are less sudden and dramatic and more personal (job loss), gradual (government will phase-out spending, not stop it) deferred (national debt), and not so permanent (jobs should ultimately come back). It doesn't look like it's over, though.I made bank due to the 2008 crash, and I am planning on making bank again. 2008 ruined a lot of people but made it possible for me to break generational poverty. This time I actually have money to ride the wave with... 

I think the big difference is that we see a light at the end of the tunnel in 2020. One vaccine and we're back in business. Herd immunity and we're going back to business.2008 was much worse.  it was a slow bleed for a year and a half.  everyone was running out of liquidity and the system completely failed.  this time around, the drop and the recovery was insanely rapid and so was the fed response.  we will move on from this quicker than 2008 thats for sure2008 is definitely worse since we still have not recovered from it before Covid.Agree. 2008 felt like the world could end. Once you've lived through that COVID seems easy. I'm still certain the world will end. Just not yet.RemindMe! 4 monthsI don’t know if this has been said, but we’re not through this yet. This is a marathon and we’re half way done but the last few miles might be uphill. Fall and winter might be devastating if the virus picks up along with the Flu. Fauci made it a point today to say we won’t see vaccines until next year.because the Fed acted much faster and are willing to buy anything this time. The Fed should never have bailed out the banking system in 2008. Capitalism is dead. This is a manipulated market, not a free one. And yes, I did capitalize the herd.>The people in my life seem to be doing well

*"I associate with upper middle class folks and they are OK, So Where is this "poverty" I keep hearing about?*

They're hiding the pain where they hide the G spot, OPThis hasn't happened yetGod damn this is comment is short sighted.    We are just about to enter the real financial fall out.The news and media are still pretty gloomy. JP Morgan is projecting 11% base case unemployment by year's end.

The big difference probably probably relates to future expectations and credit creation. Back in 2008, average Americans and loan originators were expecting the housing bull run to continue indefinitely. When things finally came home to roost, the bull market euphoria quickly 180ed. Following that, credit contracted -- people weren't willing to lend out money anymore AND people were unable to service their debt, forcing them into tight spots. 

This time around, things probably don't seem as bad since people didn't have particularly rosy forward expectations. Further, credit didn't contract the same way -- rather, a lot of debt service freezes (e.g. rent freezes) and stimulus occurred at both the personal and corporate level, partially offsetting the negative effects. Lastly, GSIB banks are FAR better capitalized and the government has taken unparalleled efforts to ensure things don't go out of hand. People also probably aren't as concerned about maintaining their lifestyle given the pandemic so the relative discomfort of "missing out" isn't as bad.In 2008 I woke up one morning to find the bank I'd been with for MANY years no longer existed. Washington Mutual (a very large bank) literally ceased to exist while I slept. The government handed the entire thing to Chase. I had no idea where my money was, how to access it, if my debit card worked, how I was going to buy food or make a house payment, etc.

I learned a lesson that day: don't hold your liquid assets in one bank. I now have multiple banks, including credit unions, with cash spread out.

It was a strange and scary time back then. I also don't feel that way this time.If no vaccine or herd immunity by next year. This could be way worse. The market is driven by hope.The worst hadn’t even come close to happening yet. Give it another 6 months. We’ll be looking back at 2008  as a marshmallowey dream. Small businesses are getting NUKED right nowIn 2008 we didn't have social media or iPhones yet. Congress was slow to make decisions effectively because information was still considered slow back then.

It also amplified information now, so you'll feel that it's much more serious today, when it actually isn't.You are in a better economic position than 2008. 2008 surprised everyone and caught most of us unprepared. You learned and protected yourself.The vast majority of people are doing well. Turn off the news.We haven't hit 2008 yet.  We're still in 2007 until the tons of folks without jobs run out of money.  We're still fine as long as people think this thing is going to go away by Christmas.  We're fine as long as people assume a vaccine is going to exist and that enough people are going to get it and everything's going to be fine before the end of the year. 

The stock market looks far enough ahead to understand short term catastrophe as long as there's a solution in sight.  The housing crisis was (as most man-made disasters like that) unpredictable in its end both in duration and severity so everything panics.  Even though it's not really logical to panic.  

If these tests don't go well and we get word that it'll be 2-3 years for a vaccine or more to be safe and distributed, I think that'll break a few things.  Because we assume it'll be safe before the end of the year (which realistically it probably won't be, but hey let's not break bubbles) the market isn't freaking out.  Any dips and dives are more Presidential related right now I think.I think anyone in r/investing isn’t fearing much of anything because we (mostly) aren’t the ones who got wiped out by the Covid crisis. It’s disproportionately effected lower class who were in disposable roles that were disposed of swiftly. Those unemployed got a huge lifeline for but their $600/wk expires like, right now, with no comparable relief in sight. Unemployment is still up 10% and the lifeline is gone, so this is worse than 2008 for them, but not for us who are looking at a flat s&p for the year. 

Govt/fed stepped in to give many public businesses that we are invested in a HUGE lifeline. The Fed stepped in and said we’ll pump liquidity into this market for as long as we have to. Everything in this relief effort has saved our economy from a massive downfall, but it’s yet to be seen how this effects those who got hit the worst throughout all of this. 

Also, we’re in the first Quarter, managing initial symptoms and putting bandaids on things. We still have to solve for housing/eviction moratorium, ppp employment fallout, education, healthcare, vaccines, unemployment, waning off QE (yikes), massive deficits at fed/state/local level, small business closures, global supply chain, consumer confidence, and a wildly uncertain future that will be steered by one of two old farts after what will go down as the most dramatic and divisive election year ever. 

Don’t panic right now, but be aware that we’re not even close to the other side of this.This is much MUCH worse.  2008 was a banking crisis.  Right now, we have an everything crisis.America has of the 26% of the total cases and 23% of the total deaths while simultaneously seceding our seat as a global power in other ways. I was young in 08, but on paper this seems worse overall.The media plays a huge role. Right now there are so many things happening that the media focuses on what THEY think it’s important... its a shame since there is so much suffering and the media does not cover.Nope this is much worseWhat's happening right now is the media is in a state of frenzy because of the upcoming election. The world is not bursting into flames, but the media will try to make it appear so.Nothing makes any sense right nowIn 2008 the elites had to scare you into letting them give each other a bunch of public money and it worked. Now they’re trying to keep poor people from getting scared and angry by acting like it was no big deal to just stand on the tracks and wait for the train to hit us.

Just saying that sounds so absurd, it’s no wonder I’m in r/conspiracy all the time trying to find some story to make sense of this other than the world is run by monkeys clicking buttons randomly.Election year + media is at war with Trump and his administration. 

All stats aren't equal and the media purposefully misleads statistically information to create a narrative and in all honestly to drum up business. 

COVID numbers are also highly inflated, the majority of people you know either knows nobody who have died or knows at the most 1 or 2. The death rate goes up astronomically around the age 65+ and up, below 65 its extremely rare, plus the people who did end up dying did so because they also had other problems with their body. Its honestly not a big deal in the relative scheme of things, a bigger deal is preventing people from working, like servers and bartenders. Those people are getting fucked, so are the people getting laid off because business are having to make cuts due to economic turn down from the "crisis."The government wants to control us all they do as they wished.I don’t have an answer for you but was thinking the same damn thing the other day.It's partly because we're all a lot more desensitized to it.Why do people not understand the difference. Back then there was a possibility that wall street was going to get blown out with no direct solution. This time? Solve the virus solve the problemDuh... markets up this year, but 2008 it crashes? What a weird post.Media didn't have the reach it does now in 2008. 
Everyone and their mother is pushing positivism in every media outlet possible, that's why it "feels" better but it really isn't.Because it wasYou're not crazy........2008 WAS worse. This "financial crisis" or whatever you want to call it is making me a lot of money and I'm not complaining.It's totally different. 2008 affected nearly everyone in some way financially. This time, it is disproportionately affecting those in industries where you cannot work from the safety of your home or isolated in an office (service industry mainly). It may not affect you because you aren't in the service industry, but for those who are, this is really hurting everyone, from the server/bartender to the restaurant owner/tour director/hotel/airline/cruise/themepark/cinema staff.2020 the bailouts came fast, 2008 they were slow.2008 was worse.  This time the government is propping up the stock market.If you thought March was bad, what's to come will be much worse.It was. We had literally trillions of dollars that didn't really exist evaporate over the course of 4 weeks....it was wild. I can assure you that 2008 was worse. This will pass in about 18 months from inception. Many businesses and property will change ownership, but we don't have a missing corner stone like in 082008 was worse. This is just a speed bump.I dont remember 08 lol. This time tho, my stock market account was down for 2 months and is now up big time, way above the highest ln february. I did however lose my extra job after school, and my summer job at the same place. But still, I dont *need* that money as I dont have any bills to pay, so yeah I bet it feels worse to you now than it did in 2006.This isn't over and you're crazy if you think it is.

It's going to take a long time to recover. A lot of the manufacturing done in America is done in the south where numbers keep spiking. The company I work for will take in literally anything we can get because demand is high and supply is so low. Meanwhile factories keep shutting down every day. Nobody knows what we can get or when we can get it. The manufacturers don't even know. They'll tell us 2 months, then in 1 month and 29 days, they call is to say it'll be another month, then in 29 days, call to push it back again...

My company downsized, all these people are permanently losing jobs and it's crazy that people are happy to be out of work since they're getting paid more with this bonus but that won't be around forever and when it's gone and you need to go back to work, you're competing for fewer jobs with a much bigger number of applicants that are unemployed. Meanwhile the companies who are hiring know people will be desperate and don't have to offer as good pay.

The stock market may have recovered pretty well so far but I would not be surprised if there was another huge crash in the next year or two.This is a slow burn vs 2008 where it was a cannonball.  I'm glad you are fine and optimistic but I know many people that are currently struggling and are out of jobs.  I would give it a few more months to see more impact.Well I feel like the United States is on the brink of a civil war with all these federal troops being sent to occupy our cities and detain our citizensWait until people are collapsing in and around their cars in traffic lineups leading to the hospitals and the markets crash (OR NOT!) while secret police round up anyone that isn't wearing the right symbolI started college in 2008 and I loved the lack of traffic. My dad had previous experiences with recessions and was always prepared for the next one so we didn't really feel it....Thats because we are at the top of the dead cat bounce. Next wave wont do shit, but the death count and mobile hospital construction that comes shortly after will be enough!2008 was way worse. People here saying that the worst is yet to come, are wrong. The 30’s the government didn’t intervene much, and the Great Depression was super long. In 2008, we had already learned that government intervention speeds up recovery and minimizes downturns. Now we are taking it to a whole other level because we know it works. The recovery will take a year or two, but it will be much better because we have a better understanding of how the economics work. I’m guessing that in two years, we will have a boom and they will allow inflation to escalate to like 5-6% so that it brings down the debt level to a smaller % of GDP. Or keep inflation low so that we can just service infinity debt.Oh good, we are starting the Bear vs. Bulls conversation. Again.A planned reset is occurring. (https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/07/covid-19-the-great-reset/) (https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/the-great-reset-this-weeks-world-vs-virus-podcast/)2009 was WAY worse.  It was a systematic collapse of a pyramid scheme banking system where people lost their life savings and never recovered.

2020 is a temporary shutdown of a great economy, where some sectors, mainly technology, have even thrived.  The market is higher than it was a year ago.  Some pain for sure but not even in the same stratosphere as 2009.The mainstream media manipulation is hyper focused on BLM related topics. 

Even if they talk about economy or unemployment, taking about BLM gets more views. 

Fear gets the most views. 2008 was talking about economy, 2020 is taking about racism. 

The protesters and supporters are kind of having to ignore covid data as well because they have to be able to protest. 

Normies are also focused on BLM because they dont want to get cancelled so there is less focus on other big issues such as the state of the economy.2008 was way worse because my house lost half its value and my investments also lost half their value. In contrast, today my home and investments are way up so as far as I'm concerned 2020 has been a great year so far!I work in manufacturing in the auto industry and we’ve been nailed by this at all levels. I took a 10% pay cut, 401k match removed indefinitely, 4 weeks of being furloughed,  and no salary increase that we were promised for the work done in ‘19. In addition I personally was removed from a bonus eligible role. I’ve lost a ton and am happy to still be working but more layoffs are coming. I got out of the service in 08 during the recession and there was no work. It all feel eerily similar. The only thing I’m perplexed but is the stock market but I honestly think it’s propped up by the government and speculators. I feel like it will hit another low.The unemployment stimulus hasn't even run out yet.Also, you're older in 2020 than 2008.  Anyone posting to the investing subreddit is likely doing pretty good financially, which likely means they've got a much bigger financial cushion 12 years later.  I was an entry level grunt in corporate America in 2008 still paying off student loans.  In 2020, I'm now in a middle management role with a large enough cushion to fall back on if I were to lose my job.  Accordingly, 2008 felt a lot worse to me personally, but the economy is more than my personal experience.  Graduating college in 2008 is still preferable to graduating college in 2020, in my opinion.

Additionally, it's still very early in the COVID crisis timeline.  The dust hasn't settled on this at all yet.  People talk about 2008 as if the crisis happened in a single year and things were fine right away, but in reality, things started getting bad in 2007, and things were still pretty dicey through 2011 or so.  We're less than six months into the impact here.  Things like eviction protections and expanded unemployment benefits have dampened the impact, but those won't last forever.  As bad as things are now, it's entirely possible for them to get worse.Anyone not watching the poor rioting? Were there riots in 2008? Kinda waiting for them to actually eat the rich as they've been saying more and more lately. Not because I advocate their message but OP's post just looks like he's not really watching the news.

Talks of racial tension/civil war, an election both sides won't accept, this annoying virus, a Chinese Cold War, and I'm  kinda waiting for some good old Islamic terror to shake things up as a wild card.

I think shit is just taking a while to really HIT...This is the real issue.

This shut down is hurting mostly people who were always bit players in the economy. Waiters, store clerks, barbers... their economic activity never drove the bus to begin with. Everyone who has an actual impact on the economy has a job they can still do during the pandemic.Yup, I think that is the major difference. You had a lot of middle-class, and wealthier people who got hit pretty hard from the loss in home values. Especially those upper-middle class people who were heavily leveraged in real estate.

This time it is basically the most vulnerable, lower income people affected. Service industry, tourism, and generally smaller businesses. Very high volume of jobs, but lower paying jobs.

One exception (other than white color) is blue color jobs. Plumbers, Electricians, etc.. I think they are maybe seeing less business, but are at least staying above water. Where I live, getting a contractor to do smaller jobs, or repairs was really hard. They all wanted the really big remodels, fancy projects, etc... I suspect they are doing a lot more smaller jobs now, which is probably more annoying for them, but still good money when it adds up.I came to say this. The current crisis overwhelmingly effects the poor and lower middle class more than the wealthy. Most of us can’t work from home and rely on a functioning supply line to work. I work in construction and see people getting laid off just because materials are so tough to come by. Almost everybody in my social circle has been negatively effected. My wife lost her job because large events are cancelled for the foreseeable future. We have quite a big savings, and relatively low expenses but I am very worried for this winter....so far.  If unemployment persists and unemployment benefits run out/aren't juiced up again, I have to think we start seeing a debt problem that eventually starts impacting the top 10%.and the stock market is a graph of rich people feelingsDepends on the rich person. If you own businesses directly and that is most of your wealth, you are in a world of hurt. If you have a bunch of equities and savings, you are fine.Nah. I worked at a major NY investment banking firm during that period and everyone was emptying their pockets on long term positions in tech, commodities, and bio sector.Probably richer than everWoohoo!Im not rich, COVID actually made me a lot of money....until stimulus stopsAbout 30 million people are losing supplemental unemployment this week


Let’s see what that doesAm rich, can confirm.  Got $20,000 from the feds that my accountant had to talk me into taking because our businesses are relatively unscathed except for the covid-19 rental refunds.  More than made up for what I lost and I donated the rest to our local food bank.

2008 sucked way worse in hindsight, but only financially. 

But at least we ostensibly had adults in charge then.  Things rapidly got better and I didn't have to find out that half of my friends have serious character issues as I am now.

This is far from over.The wealth gap has widened substantially since then. The more it widens, the more insulated the hyper-wealthy are. Climate change is only going to exacerbate it. Plus ça change...Agreed. It's important to recognize that the cause of the GFC was largely seen as systemic with blame easily being appointed to a certain group of individuals or corporations, while this pandemic has so far been considered largely temporary and with no fault of anyone's. I think this plays into the bias the many have towards how quick and smoothly we come out of this (i.e. reflection of the strong stock market). This is not to say these levels are warranted, only that this bias exists.I think the government will extend benefits to keep the markets up.  Also we are on the cusp of having a widespread vaccine available by the end of 2020 early 2021.  So much money and brain power is being thrown into developing a vaccine I’m confident we will have one.  This is all assuming the virus doesn’t mutate too much to where the vaccine isn’t viable anymore.I don’t think we’ve even begun to see the actually recessionary impact yet. This crisis can be divided into two components. The original non-economic shock from the forced shutdowns and then the ensuing 2nd and 3rd order recessionary effects that follow.

So far we’ve seen the horrible data where we just dropped off the cliff and now we’ve seen the rapid bounces off of the lows. The strong bounce back was too be excepted simply as a function of rate of change math. It gets breathlessly reported as proof of the V shaped recovery but it’s nothing of the sort.

Government aid has kept people from feeing the effects so far. Foreclosure and evictions were banned, debt payments were delayed, huge UI benefits, etc.. I think we are just now starting to get a taste of where this crisis goes next. It’s going to be worse than 2008 and the recovery is going to take even longer. And that’s even assuming optimistically we don’t get another liquidity event in financial markets.Financial system was in worse shape in 2008? Extremely blanketed statement...This^^ 

In 2008 (smart) people worried that money would be worthless and the financial sector would cease to exist. 

Right now we have very little systemic risk, and the little bit that we do have is ballasted by the fact corporate America's interest is aligned with consumers. If they default everyone with mortgages/loans in arrears they'll just be screwing themselves as it'll create a worse economy once we get out of this. 2020 is more like 'the big pause' than the great recession. Not saying that everyone will come out unscathed but this isn't even remotely comparable to 08. Still bad for the economy obviously though

As my TV says 'its a public health crisis not a financial crises'.There is no way Trump is going to suspend financial support to people/small business 3 months shy of the elecction day. My guess is that they are going to keep everyone on support till the vaccine begins to roll out.Financial system is worse.... and it it will become apparent when we start having to payback all the trillions of dollars of debt we incurred from the stimulus packages. we never even paid of all the debt from the first financial crisis. 

Fed's solution to the popped bubble is pumping more air into instead of letting it deflate.

Yeah in a general sense you could make the argument "its getting worse" but the reality is people are not dropping like flies.I know. But I still feel impact in 2009 was far greater, even emotionally. People were just leaving houses with depression ,,just like that leaving all their things behind. Lehman brothers, Bear Sterns kind of mega companies were all going bankrupt.Washington Mutual, Countrywide Financial , Merrill edge kind of companies were saved by merging into big banks. Madoff scandal was another thing. I remember Obama entered into a perfect storm and then had tons congress overnight meetings in January that he looked like zombie in Feb. This pandemic would have been worse if Fed didn't react on time. Fed cut rates to zero even before this virus was declared pandemic by WHO. I think Fed acted way faster than White House or CDC. Its 2008 experience is still new and they just jumped into action."Let's shoot for 100 trillion. I like round numbers.The US has provided far less support than other countries.  Providing year long to lifetime social safety net is absolutely possible but for some reason America won’t admit it has a problem.[removed][removed]But all the employers are open again and people have money to spend in those stores. Gov will get their money back by either printing more or slowly taxing people and getting it back. 

Most will go without a huge hit to their finances.Its sustainable its just that senate wont do it.100% this. Op is putting it gently: a fucking idiot. Seriously. I'm being gentle here. Covid hasn't peaked and neither has unemployment. Amazing to compare this to 2008.*the government is paying more than they used to make and more than they would on ordinary unemployment.*Yes. It's kind of funny that with with so much access to information in 2007/2008 showing deteriorating economic data the market continued bouncing along with relatively little reaction for nearly a year. 

I don't know the future but it really seems like market reaction is similarly out of sync with economic reality like 2007.Everything you said is so true.  I remember in summer '07 I worked a job where I drove a truck with a crappy radio and the only thing that came in was AM stations and I wasn't following markets at all at the time.  I was about 20.

Anyways, one night they made such a big deal about problems with these things called mortgage back securities (could have even been something different, I don't remember but assume it was MBS's) that were in trouble and how disastrous this was eventually going to be.  I have absolutely no idea what station I was listening to.  Might have even been one of those conspiracy UFO shows.  Anyway, the point was **this was '07**.  It was a little over a year later when the financial world was set on fire.

TLDR: Tell me how much of a nothingburger this was next summer.Yes, this situation is much slower moving. It was 3 years after that financial collapse before Occupy Wall Street started. Think about that timeline when you think about the possibilities of social unrest a couple of years from now. This is the time to become more self-sufficient & decentralize from the machine.Also, the white collar job loss bloodbath is just beginning. Hospitality took the first hit and will likely return faster, industries like mine that are currently sailing along (IT) that operate on clients making big investments in new systems/features are going to be hurting in 6 to 18 months. We are currently working full time full staff because our contract was signed  x months/years in the past when client was profitable. Clients are hemorrhaging money now, so I guarantee when it's time to renew contracts or consider rolling out new features/ services they're going to decide not to. THEN I and my team will be ruthlessly culled."buy when others are fearful"  


There is a surplus of fear...The barrage of over qualified has been happening since before covid. I was looking for a designer / webdev / video editor and some applicants with ten years of experience were willing to handle an hour+ commute for minimum wage. Every day was about 20 resumes but had to close the position due to budget freeze. Our economy wasn't that great pre covid, remember what happened in December 2018 when rates went up?I’ve noticed the average age of delivery people (Uber Eats etc.) has gone way up. I haven’t had one under 40 since March.mAn ThE bEaRs ReAlLy DoN't gEt TiReD oF BeInG wRoNgYou seem 100% confident it didn't. What are your positions, so I can just copy off Nostradamus' portfolio?We acted very quickly this time, opposite of 2008, I read this might be the reason this crisis doesn't hit us as hard as the last one did.What if -- get this -- they extend the benefits?You forgot BrexitDon't worry, our 10 pound meal deal will surely help the economy recover.Businesses have shuttered and closed down. Layoffs have occurred and more are coming. Demand is contracting. Many jobs will not be coming back.I'm really worried that any vaccine will be (effectively) useless. 30% of Americans think it will be a vehicle for Bill Gates to implant tracking devices ([source](https://news.yahoo.com/new-yahoo-news-you-gov-poll-shows-coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-spreading-on-the-right-may-hamper-vaccine-efforts-152843610.html)) for crying out loud. Add in the immunocompromised, and I doubt even half of Americans will get the vaccine.

IMO, there will be an ongoing (years), massive threat of large human death counts. This is going to have a massive, long-term effect on supply and demand of both goods and labor.

TLDR: Vaccine hopes be damned, IMO we're screwed. :)The key question is whether we get a working vaccine by Q1 2021 - if we do, back to business as usual in 3 months. If not, things could get uglier than 2001 and 2009 combined.That might have been this case if the shutdown was three weeks. It's too late for that now. Businesses are closed and not coming back.You mean backed by money printer> Was it worse because that was your first crisis that you lived through and now you are more prepared?

 Not OP but I was invested in stocks in 2008, and in mutual funds during the dot.com bubble.

 I get the OP's point about it not seeming worse. But that doesnt mean it wont get worse. Some people in 2005-6 were getting uncomfortable with valuations and debt but most were cheerleading the bubble:


*"Why are you worrying? Stocks are up, unemployment is down, inflation is flat, real estate is through the roof! EVERYTHING IS GREAT!"*


 At some point enthusiasm and positivity becomes irrational. I thought we passed that point in 2019. 


 Can the 'irrational exuberance' continue from here? Of course. But the longer it goes on, the worse it is when the bubble pops.Plus, everyone keeps saying 2008 but everything started to happen in 2007, it just took a little bit of time to actually play out, and then even more time to bottomAnd if they don't extend those unemployment checks, that's about to be true all over again.A good portion of the country knows someone unemployed right now.>That's because it was a housing crisis. A good portion of the country knew someone that was losing their home.

There is a very real chance that this becomes a housing crisis too.  A lot of people haven't been able to pay their rent.  For now, it's not a problem, because eviction moratoriums prevent the landlord from taking action.  Those eviction moratoriums won't last forever though.well, now a good portion cant get a new home, because noone wants to rent to anyone because they cant evict them. i make 4k a mo. i cant find a single apartment that will take me. my credit isnt great.....but holy shit is it not that bad. im basically couch crashing.Hyperinflation?>so theyre not obstructing aid

The next aid package seems to be in a bit more trouble, though.In 2008 Bush was still president... Obama was elected in 2008, he took office in January 2009.What happened to the Tea Party?     

All of a sudden they love government benefits.obscuring the science instead.If Trump loses are you going to blame the Democrat president for not acting fast enough at the start of the 2020 pandemic too?>the difference this time around is that the gop has the presidency, so theyre not obstructing aid, like they did with obama and the years that followed.

What? Obama was not president in 2008.  George W. Bush was president.  Similar to what we're seeing in 2020, most of the early Federal measures were put in place by Bush in the last year of his term.  If Biden wins in November like many polling models forecast, Trump will still be president through January 2021, just like Bush was president through January 2009.1k people die a day regardless of covid.To put 1 trillion into perspective, thats enough to give every person in the United States $3048. Its a LOT of money.If the government has the will to tax those not using their wealth except for more wealth then there will be a fine resolution to it. Any austerity or taxes on those who spend (a.k.a. The drivers of the economy) as a resolution will lead to a depressed economy. This is a simplification, but boiled down I suspect this will be the case.In 2008, life in general was still pretty much humming along. You could do crazy things like... Go to a restaurant, attend a concert, and get your hair cut! 

But in 2020, with a global pandemic and massive unemployment at a scale never seen before... The stock market is at it's all time highs!? Crazy times.Coordinated propaganda is a helluva drug.Banking crisis? We're way past that. We're into sovereign debt crisis territory.I remember before covid when people didn’t die.To pretend you know what's going to happen in 3-4 months when its impossible to predict what happening two weeks out is pretty humorous.Why November? What’s the catalyst?COLLAPSE IS IMMINENT WE ARE ALL DOOOOOOOOMED

nigga JPow will just keep printing money until covid is overHeck I was saying this before COVIDIf biden wins the market will for sure tank. There is zero confident in wall str in bidenI agree. I think regardless of who wins the election it is going to be very worrisome for investors. In one hand you have Biden who will want to increase taxes heavily which will be extra burdensome with the coronavirus impact. Then you have Trump who if he wins there is bound to be more looting, rioting, revolutions, potential coups in democrat ran cities.

November will be a great time to buy stocks. Should be a fire sale.Or trade your cash for GLD / SLV. Dollar declined 5% in 3 mos.

There’s tons of terrible economic news....but the financial crisis itself is over. Banks are still lending with reprised risk, and the equity universe is having a consistent rally on low volume due to everyone being scared.p of further fallout to come like the Eurozone crisis.I work in housing policy in CA. a majority of city/counties here have issue moratoria on evictions. Vast majority do not cancel or lower rental debt, just pushing it further into the future. a lot of these stopgaps require repayment of back rent in a 90 day, 120 day period. If COVID isn’t contained by sept, a lot of families are accruing more than 6 months of back rent. And cancelling rental debt doesn’t solve the issues as it puts landlords’ mortgages in a bind. Not sure how we get out of it if money is finite. 

Unemployment and the stimulus boosted folks here. Another round will help a lot of ppl stay afloat. 

Currently, the cocktail of horrible doesn’t feel hopeless because people can’t be removed from their homes due to policies to delay mass evictions.NY and LA at 20% unemployment.All growth since 1929 was fakeRight? It doesn't make much sense comparing the 2007-08 crisis with a 5-month-old recession. Even as late as May 2008, the average person in the US wasn't really panicking or thought anything was too wrong with the economy.

This is not going to just hit "low wage earners".>The effect this has had on most middle class folks with skilled jobs is that they now mostly work from home which results in them saving money, spending more time with family and overall a decent increase in quality of life

I don't think this is really true. At least not for most people with kids.

My kid is trapped at home (pre-school still closed), watches tons of TV, can't play with anyone, is bored and lethargic all day. I can't take him to the playground because they have them closed in my city. He basically gets outside on weekends when I am not working.

As for my own health. I used to walk 30-45 minutes a day, to get to my office, and I was generally out and about more. Never realized how much that contributed to my health.

I do feel very fortunate to still have a job right now, and I know that many people are struggling. But I would not call this a net-increase in quality of life for me, at any measurement.Financial? Hell, go smaller. From a publicly traded, large cap perspective only.

In any case, a vaccine will come too late to avoid the double calamity of covid19 and a potentially bad flu season. It’s still also possible that the vaccines entering phase 3 trials will be shown to have limited or no efficacy against corona virus.

Oh wait.> 2020 is a temporary shutdown of a great economy

 If you think it was a 'great economy'. I thought before COVID  that we were in a speculative bubble and overheated economy.


 And everything has gotten worse.Yeah you nailed it. Companies are filling for bankruptcy at rates faster than 2008. Yet it literally doesn’t affect any of the (99%ers) consumers because of the unemployment benefits. Once those stop and the people who once had a job and now don’t... well shit is going to hit the fan" As bad as things are now, it's entirely possible for them to get worse." 

Excellent reply. I'd reword this last sentence, though. The speed and scale of government response means that a lot of the harm hasn't even started yet. Things like job and pay cuts for professionals, for example. A friend of mine works in Singapore for a company that helps design product packaging. He's been been paid as normal and worked from home through their lockdown, but he's noticed that business is starting to get quiet. It seems like companies are cutting back on spending on product redesign and there could also be fewer new products hitting the market. Many industries that were fine initially will be hit by these secondary effects as everyone takes turns to spend less.You brought up a lot of good points. In general. the situation in 2020 might not even be at it's peak. Only time will tell on which financial crisis was worse but I believe 2020 will be worse for the average person considering how long the economy will be shut down, how difficult it will be to recover, and how the tech bubble might pop.IDK, a looooot of people are teeagers/early 20s who don't have two dimes to rub together, looking to start. Nothing wrong with that, but it kinda negates your financial cushion idea.Graduating college with a STEM degree may be fine in 2020Don’t forget a natural disaster or two in some major cities>shit is just taking a while to really HIT...

Yup, we are a few months after a massive shock and corresponding massive stimulus.  Our economic fundamentals were greatly impacted/changed as a result of COVID.  There will be a drop, it will effect the rich, it's only a matter of time.

It won't effect amazon, because amazon's fundamentals weren't changed.  Or, covid won't.  When people stop  buying due to recession, it will.

We are lucky as hell that we have the internet and computers today such that a good fraction of people could keep working,  delivery services were easy to jump to, and so on and so forth.  It's crazy how robust/adaptive our society can be.  Fifty years ago we wouldn't have been able to react like we did today.>  where were the riots in 2008?

See: occupy Wall Street, the tea party, etc.Well said. The riots were about race but can quickly evolve to hunger, rent/mortgage forgiveness, lack of health access, China, mistrust of the government, rejecting the vaccine when there is one, etc.

I expect things to get a lot more complicated within a year or so.Terrorists are literally no threat to Americans, it's such a overblown issue. 9/11 was awful, but that didn't justify invading two countries, and kill 100k civilians (obviously it was collateral and they weren't actively killing civilians for fun).

Terrorists are a literal Boogie man to scare the American public, sure it'll happen. So many mass shootings are considered terrorist actions for some reason or another, probably because they aren't brown. You're more likely to die to crazy person off their meds or to a police officer, than a Islamic terrorist. 

The Vietnam Era was arguably worse minus the virus, there was so much uncertainty, civil unrest. We made it through, doubt it'll be different this time. The public has a very very short attention span, the moment things aren't on the news or their favourite YouTuber isn't talking about it, it's forgotten. 

Or maybe it will be different this time, who knows really.And this is why BLM and all the racial tension is such a masterful manipulation and distraction. 

Corporations can't let another Occupy Wall Street happen again. That movement was actually uniting, and so much less divisive. It was literally the 99% vs the 1%.

Nahhhh, can't have that shit. Let's get everyone riled up about "racism" in the USA (one of the most diverse and least racist countries), and throw the country into a political civil war. 

Nike and Amazon will even advertise the movement on their website. 

Just don't pay attention to the REAL economic problems and economic divides that are really at the hear of most these proclaimed injustices. 💯 Way worse now than '08 but I was blacking out nightly back then so who can saystop calling rightful protesting “riots”Oh look, we've got an opinion-haver who didn't bother to look at what's actually going on:

>Anyone not watching the poor rioting? 

First: this is not "rioting"; second: it's not "the poor." You don't seem to understand what's going on - so don't expect much understanding of the outcome, either.

The ongoing protests are against police brutality. There was some initial rioting and looting, but that quickly settled down into mostly peaceful protests. Are you really stupid enough to think that if there was continuous rioting and looting for 50 days there would still be anything left to riot over? These are either the worst rioters ever - or... follow closely here - it's not a riot, the looting was extremely limited - and the protest intensity has only ramped back up in response to increased police brutality and heavy-handed federal stupidity.

It's also not about "the poor". These protests are happening near major cities. They are being attended by anyone who is outraged at the injustice and lack of police accountability for their violence and corruption. The concerns should cross lines of wealth, race and gender.

The protests themselves aren't going to cause much economic repercussion. However, the protests are being used by some as an outlet for secondary frustrations - and those are symptoms of likely \*will\* cause economic problems. Chief among them is the concept that "essential workers" - who yes, usually are less affluent - are being forced to work in a pandemic.

Workers are being given the choice of working in unsafe conditions and possibly dying; or (if they don't go to work) - losing their unemployment benefits and then maybe their home. The problem here is that it's really a stupid business plan to try and kill your workers, I expect multiple dumb companies will be forced to close because rather than trying to protect their employees they murdered everyone who was working for them.

Anyone in stock market indices (particularly tech) so far has been fine. But the real problem is a nested meta-problem: the dollar is in danger of collapsing because of the massively incompetent administration, just as companies are in danger of collapsing because of incompetent owners. It turns out that companies and countries that don't care about their employees and citizens dying is probably a **really bad** investment.

The rest of the world has (justifiably) lost faith in the US economy and our ability to navigate this pandemic, I expect the unloading of the dollar to continue further. It's easy to imagine that in a year the rest of the world has beaten the pandemic without a vaccine because they can wear a fucking mask for two weeks - whereas the US is still a nation of diseased plague carriers, with millions dead, famine and collapsed supply chains.All during an election year. And another commenter just mentioned natural disaster. There’s already a hurricane brewing. I’m seeing the perfect storm from where I’m sitting.Occupy Wall StreetStop watching the newsDon't forget we are finishing the year with a potentially hard brexit over here in the UKThere was like 1-2 nights of riots over racial issues. What riots are you talking about?Aliens, man.Don’t discount OccupyWallSt and the Tea Party Movement coming out of ‘08.Describing nationwide protests as "poor rioting" and "racial tension/civil war" isn't exactly helping.The poor rioting? Or do you mean all the rich children in Portland and Seattle.I got calls on the murder hornets myself high risk high reward. I do like civil war as a decent favorite thought, i'll fade the Islamic terror this time around I just don't think the narrative works well anymore. Maybe some shorts on cold war too but we'll see how the roulette wheel spins this time .> Kinda waiting for them to actually eat the rich as they've been saying more and more lately.

Deservedly so imo. A bit obtuse to be thinking "profits over lives" at this point, or at any point at all. But hey if chasing wealth is your prerogative then I wish ya well.I think racial aspect of riots is not sustainable because it is fake/fabricated. I looked at the demands, they want quota jobs with high pay (for example opportunists at higher education) and all types of handouts.This is the only reason I get bothered by seeing BLM protests. Making it about white versus black takes away from the real problem it’s rich oppressing the poor. Why do you think rich people and these PACs for both parties are donating to all of these marches and protests.Once the unemployment runs out, the evictions start and the earnings reports come in for Q3 and Q4 then the ivory tower gated community crowd is going to feel a fraction of the pain. It's going to be a slow burn and a slower recovery. The C-level execs know this at the big companies. Hiring has dried up substantially and they're hoarding as much cash as possible to weather the storms.I’m pretty sure that small businesses in retail, food service, and hospitality have an actual impact on the economy and should not be so easily dismissed as “bit players.”Bro, just because you didn't get laid off doesn't mean there aren't more people getting laid off. I had an office job, still got laid off. I know plenty of engineers who got laid off.How this gets upvoted...I’ll never understand. Economic systems are a pyramid, and everything described in this comment is the base.Yup. I’ve been saying this for months. Unemployment is up, but as a percentage of our economy we’re talking margin of error.

Bezos gets covid and we’re in a recession. He’s worth more than about half the country combined.

Employment numbers and small businesses are disconnected from the economy because their economic impact is so little in today’s economy.> Everyone who has an actual impact on the economy has a job they can still do during the pandemic.

Don't those waiters, store clerks, barbers, etc all spend a fair amount on rent, food, clothes, and other economic activity? If we have sustained double digit unemployment, I think those "who have an actual impact" will start to feel it if those "bit players" stop spending.

They may be floated for now with stimulus, but eventually when tens of thousands of small businesses fold and the government checks dry up, the economic impact of their reduced spending will be felt.[removed]All of those people in aggregate are very important to the economy. However the Fed and federal responses have been faster and more effective this time around.Lol you’re fucking stupid. Yeah let’s see how far the economy goes without these “bit players”I can assure you some of the people who really drove the economy lost their job. Im talking about airlines here. The fact that planes dont fly much have a massive impact on other industries.> their economic activity never drove the bus to begin with.

I think you may be in for a surprise if/when that 600 weekly evaporates. the spending of this population is not to be trivialized. Barbers are consumers, too.I’m just going to wait a few months to tell you how “ insert word for slow person” you are for thinking 30+ million “bit players” losing their jobs won’t have a substantial and meaningful impact on the whole economy. 


RemindMe! 3 Months “Tell that one “insert word for slow person off.”Man it's crazy to think the wealth gap was closer in 2008 than now, you never expected it, but are we about to be living in some Deus Ex world with people living in the sewers?Right, I agree and hope the future follows the bullish story. But in the back of my mind I’m thinking back to 2007 and thinking about how the market isn’t always as forward looking/highly efficient/priced in as people like to think.Well they have about six hours left to extend the benefitsMan everytime I see such vaccine optimism I have to chuckle. I feel people want to believe we're so close to a vaccine so badly all proper scientific skepticism goes out the window.I also agree with what you said below and want to add; With every recession we seem to learn something. From the Great Depression we experienced unemployment. In 2008, Bernanke said to pump the market with money as to not cause deflation (which helped greatly), and now with 2020 (just the start) we pumped the market with even more money. Although I am not sure if we will have inflation or deflation over the next year. I am almost certain it could be much worse. I think we have this in the bag for the most part, but things can change and we will see over the next year and a half, and a few years down the line.>  Also we are on the cusp of having a widespread vaccine available by the end of 2020 early 2021.

source?I agree with this, but how much money will they have to print before a vaccine comes out? And when will the consequences of all that printing be felt?Despite everything that’s out there and what you’ve read, we are nowhere near close to a vaccine. The media’s report of a vaccine is just optimism to keep everyone’s hope up. The latest viral strain of the coronavirus has already mutated so much that it is already very different from the February strain.If they extend the benefits it's an insane incentive for people to keep doing fuck all and spread the virus as much as possibleYes. If you want specific data look at common finanical sector health measures like credit spreads and NFCI. In 2008 these were at recession levels versus today they aren't...Remind me! 14 daysremindme! 24 months RemindMe! 24 months2022 is the 2007 of 2008This stale ass shit is *so* annoying.Yes. Just be good at timing the market and you'll be fine.With how fast things are going, I'm expecting it to be 2-3 months left to profit before we get out.What's the PT?He has no clue, just like the people posting You are here on the great depression chart when it started going up a bit in March predicting a much deeper near term fall and being completely wrong.How soSo we have 2 years to make bank before the market fallsCan you see 2 years in to the future? NO, THAT IS NOT PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE.They didn’t make it.. THEY DECLARED ITRemindMe! 12 monthsYou know you need 2 quarters of economic contraction before you can call it a recession right? That’s why it only just became official...r/unexpectedNBA RemindMe! 6 monthsThat's *Doctor* Michael Burry.More like RemindMe! 24 monthsJust a heads up, 2008 - 2006 is 2 years. 2022 is not in 4 months.He's saying it's the calm before the storm, not pretending as if this'll play out exactly like 2006 to 2008.  Do you disagree? If so, why?

The way I see it, we're in the middle of the most significant global economic shutdown in the history of humanity, but the economic pain has been really limited so far.  It's reasonable to assume that won't last forever.  The economic pain will eventually catch up to us, in large part because the mitigating efforts (enhanced UE benefits, eviction moratoriums, etc.) aren't sustainable in perpetuity.*👀 Remember to type kminder in the future for reminder to be picked up or your reminder confirmation will be delayed.*

So yes, we can print ad infinitum, but it will cost us our fiat hegemony and reserve status as countries default and pick something else.It may be huge but even the US has a credit limit eventually.Nothing. Welcome to the land of Keynesian economics and fiat currency. Inflationary pressures will push up assets more than anything else, and any business left behind becomes a market opportunity for someone else.The US doesn't exist in a vacuum. If the US economy fails, other countries are still going to protect theirs from being collateral damage.Until we are no longer deflationary and inflation starts to rise. That’s when fed stop printing and raise interest rates and recession starts.*Weimar Republic wants to chat*Money will lose value if it doesn't represent goods and services. For example if you have $10 in the economy representing 10 goods/services and now due to covid 3/10 services arent being consumed (bars movie theatres,etc) now the remaining 7 goods are worth more than a dollar. Injecting cash will increase the monetary value of the goods and services that are being produced ie inflationThey can in theory continue inflating the money supply forever if and only if the velocity of money remains nearly stagnant.

However when money starts moving again, there will be inflationary forces.  When inflation rears its head, the FED has to respond by raising rates and contain it.

MMT's solution for suppressing inflationary forces in an unlimited printing press world is.... Raise rates & raise taxes.

So the FED is trapped into this crazy vortex of printing money to 'stabilize' the markets, but this repair is exasperating the impacts of the future solution.  When this top starts the wobble it's gonna get pretty bumpy.Nothing. This is going to wreck our economy in the long term and hurt the retirements of the average american.Man the bears really don't get tired of being wrongI agree.  Much of the stimulus that helped get us out of that mess was still in place when this new crisis arose.\*\*From 1929....People haven't left their houses in this crisis yet because their bills are being paid.  Mortgage companies are showing leniency this time ... so far.

I hope for all of us this situation turns out better.

Oh and the drunken sailor is the central bank and loves cocaine and /r/wallstreetbetsWhat. Do you think that 4 million active cases and millions of unemployed Americans is just gonna die down while the economy keeps climbing?I mean. Fuck. This is still the 2008 crisis. We are still kicking the can down the road.odds are they will not extend the furlough scheme, with Brexit on the books too. The UK is in for a nice kick up the arseThat would just push the inevitable back a few months, and add to the huge debt burden, which is a dead weight on growth. Either way, the problem doesn’t disappear. We have breached the 90% level, we don’t want to be adding and adding to that for low ROI public spending, that will only compound the crisis. That’s without even touching in the fact that the government have already said they aren’t extending.

When the government stimulus starts to run out for both Main Street and Wall Street, we could be in serious trouble. 

The Trump's administrations unwillingness to take this seriously from Day 1 doomed us to major economic upheaval. It didn't have to be this way - just look at South Korea and New Zealand.> I'm really worried that any vaccine will be (effectively) useless.

I agree. There are challenges in mass-producing and distributing the vaccine globally, and the people will be skeptical in adopting the vaccine..

We are definitely screwed. On the bright side, stocks will be cheaper if the economy really tanks :\ So, there's that..Or if we just give up and stop caring about covid at all, which seems to be the way things are goingI am thinking of supply, would we or how long would it take to get it to everyone? and i don't mean just in USThis is not feasible for many reasons ranging from the realities of vaccine development to Americans' poor vaccination rates/philosophy to our shitty healthcare system that will make the vaccine a profiteering opportunity.The FED literally did their job. 

In 2008, they would’ve been propping up cheaters and liars. And I guess they eventually did. 

I don’t doubt there are people that are still playing fast and loose but overall, this is the virus’ fault.[removed]In the US, yesYeah but now the fed is paying their billsMost people I know who are unemployed are making significantly more than they were when they were employed.

In 2008, there wasn't a surge in buying of high end TVs.You should look at the house selling rate right now. It is extremely high. Tons of people are buying houses right now. 

Idk where you live, so I can’t speak to your situation, but it is not indicative of the economy.landlords are starting to feel the heat in NYC - everyone I know is getting deals on renewals or on new placesnot very possible in near term for USThey're obstructing themselves. It's R's fighting with R's.They always did, they just didn’t know it.

Can we just do that instead of whatever we are doing?Yeah I remember 08 I was laid off from a sales jobSame thing. 😉If your political debates are as intellectually disingenuous as your reply, you must be a lot of fun to talk to.Obviously it’s a bold and nearly impossible prediction, not arguing that. But what does the time frame have to do with it? I could say that the market will recover and be back to averaging 7% yoy returns over in 15 years.

Is that also humorous because I have no clue what will happen over the next 2 weeks?Presidential Election is what he is referencing[removed]True, and also it's not even about their confidence in Bidens capabilities.  Biden has barely said anything about what he wants to accomplish, but what he has said is that he's going to ramp regulations back up and raise taxes.  And that might be exactly the best course of action for the country as a whole, but it will certainly take stock valuations WAY down in the shorter term.  

Also, without Trump constantly bullying JPow and the fed, interests rates will rise and the days of free money will be over.  Definitely bad for stock valuations.keep some of both. you'll need cash for day to days.Yes I agree, Democrat Mayors are terrible at running their cities.But dems ultimately want to tax people for the money, Republicans are just printing more[removed]A lot of people have lost a lot of money by betting against the market.

This is where this buy and hold simpleton Boglehead simply comes in to this sub with a container of popcorn for the entertainment.!remindme 4 monthsyes, debt service payment as a percentage of DPI has been declining but so had long term interest rates.  The Fed intentionally did yield control, so consumer could pay off and service more debt.

However, if interest rate went up to 5%, that chart would be very different.  Analyze the second order effect on the function, yo.i didnt say that obviously things can get worse. the systems in checks only delays the inevitable not prevent itaww man no memes!?Except predicting what this post is referencing, the 08 financial crisisYes. The fact that the Federal Reserve pushes more and more money into the market. Quantitative easing + low interest rates that's what you get. Check the history. Stocks will go down when Federal Reserve  announces higher interest rates. I believe this won't happen until US is done with covid since a contractionary policy right now would be devastating and unsustainable.

https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/021015/how-does-quantitative-easing-us-affect-stock-market.aspGovt's free money has been helping people during the last few months. The foreclosures are coming.Yet\*I read something saying half of black families are at risk of eviction right now and many others are, too. People are likely to lose homes left and right without more extensive government intervention. To say nothing of people who are priced out of renting with soon to be no income.

Even Wall Street is begging for the government to give money to people and no one ever accused them of charity.80% is still a vast majority.My bank accounts are all I need to look at, buddy 😉Sovereign nations don’t ever need to pay off their debt, they just need to be able to service it.

If you don’t think record stock indexes, low unemployment, low inflation and low interest rates is representative of a a great economy then I don’t know what fantasy world you’re living in.Yes, the majority of us haven't begun to feel the scale of this yet. It's coming...Last checks went out today... Gonna be interesting/scary depending what does or doesn't get passed.  Maybe another Hurricane Katrina? A 2004 type Tsunami causing a nuclear disaster?


 It's 2020. We gotta get them all.Three gorges dam.Hurricane season is here and Houston is gonna get shit on.Oh my gosh, when the COVID was just beginning here in Utah we all felt cursed, no joke- the stores shelves were quickly empty and a couple days later we felt an earthquake in the morning. Lol some people here in Utah told me they really felt like it was the end of times!> Fifty years ago we wouldn't have been able to react like we did today.

Haha... 50 years ago we would have just shrugged it off and not reacted at all!  

The [1968 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_flu) killed 4 million people.  We held the Woodstock music festival right in the middle of its peak.  I never heard of it until this year, it was so completely shrugged off and forgotten.The other thing too, is that in this case there is an actual "cure" out there for the crisis.  It gives people some hope there will be a vaccine for the Chinese virus.  '08 on the other hand, what is the cure for "oops you lost your home and your retirement was wrapped up in dogshit CDOs.  Sorry."50 years ago most peoples food came from the area they live in. It’s much different now. Just because the supply chain hasn’t broke yet, doesn’t mean it won’t.Both of those came well after 2008.  Tea party was 2010, occupy was 2011.> The riots were about race but can quickly evolve to hunger, rent/mortgage forgiveness, lack of health access, China, mistrust of the government, rejecting the vaccine when there is one, etc.

Ya know, I'm pretty sure that if COVID didn't devastate the people who were already struggling (and pretty much only the people who were struggling beforehand) we wouldn't be seeing riots. People whose situation could get a lot worse if shit hit the fan don't riot.I bet once  a viable vaccine is \[readily\] available, plenty of tensions will start cooling off though because covid-19 has significantly more downward force, by far, than any of the other current issues.And if our government and powers at be are smart (and they are), they will keep the protests about race.

The LAST thing they want is a movement like Occupy Wall Street right now.

But have no fear, the Democrats will play their part in the political manipulation. They will do their political grandstanding about how racist this country is ,BLM and all the rest of it. It's not about economic divides. It's those RACIST COPS and Trump supporters!More like a million civilians, but who’s counting>Terrorists are literally no threat to Americans

>Terrorists are a literal Boogie man to scare the American public

I don't think the word "literally" means what you think it means.You're more likely to be killed by a toddler than an Islamic terrorist. Domestic terrorists (you know, right wing incel mass shooter types) are a far greater threat.>9/11 was awful, but that didn't justify invading two countries, and kill 100k civilians (obviously it was collateral and they weren't actively killing civilians for fun).

People often forget this wasn't free. We wasted $2T to pad the bottom line of Dick Cheney's Halliburton and Erik Prince's Blackwater, among others.This is much different than the 60’s. People HATE each other based on political party, The Internet has let instability invade our country through weird conspiracies like Qanon. People are THIRSTING for civil war. And we will have it. The spark will be the election. Trump will lose. He’ll refuse the results and refuse to give up power. And the country will burnI can see terrorist groups get affected by COVID as well and at the moment, they are probably more occupied with how China is treating the Muslim minorities in China rather than US.

US has not had any provocative actions to terrorist groups in years. China on the other hand ...> Terrorists are literally no threat to Americans

Domestic terrorism (usually done by a white supremacist) has been steadily on the rise, even the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/confronting-white-supremacy) mentions it. What the fuck, stop downplaying the issue you piece of shit.That's what Andrew Yang has been saying the cause is a mindset of scarcity. If everyone is doing well economically, we're less racists, prejudice and more  tolerant.Did you just regard the US as one of the least racist countries? I won’t even school you on that. I will say that race and class are inextricable in the US and the BLM has as much to do with class as it does with race, albeit that isn’t the forefront. BLM isn’t a distraction. It’s actually a catalyst, like many Black movements in US history, for even larger movements. The protests started with BLM after George Floyd and for Breonna Taylor. This has catalyzed movements across the country. It’s the reason Portland is doing what it’s doing now. It’s the reason CHAZ existed even if it was for a short time. 

This country may very well fall into a “political civil war” whatever that means. What I can say for certain is that class uprising will continue to take place especially as the conditions of COVID and it’s impacts worsen.They're not calling the protests "riots," they're calling the riots "riots"Even you don't believe the things you wroteCouldn’t agree more. Great breakdown.Ok, I forgot to count the trust fund kids. I was thinking of looting and vandalism at first.Yeah, eat the people paying the most taxes, that always works out well.I agree.  Cuts are coming with my employer (financial sector & IT).The eviction moratorium in most states has been extended still many months in the future, and a decent number of states have extended uneployment insurance also by a decent few weeks from today.

But the feds probably won't continue to do the $600 extra from what I gather.Evictions ain't happening. The is a big myth. Most states have quite progressive tenants laws now. Evicting was hard BEFORE Covid-19. Now with hall the moratoriums, and sympathetic courts, I really don't see this big eviction crisis everyone keeps beating the drum about.

I think we are getting close to just opening things back up. The steps we are taking are getting pointless. Tons of people not wearing masks, not social distancing, etc... I mean, why close everything down if people wont follow the rules anyways?

I think the mask rules will stay in place for a long time, but this country is going to have to  bite the bullet and let businesses re-open. There will be no "perfect" all clear to signal a "safe" re-open.Half of employment is small businesses, if half of people go bust were all fucked this guy is a moron.Sadly in this context they are “bit players.” Otherwise they would be the ones receiving the bulk of PPP instead of any going to publicly traded companies.Yet, here we are.I believe he’s  talking about the employees at these small businesses. Not taking away their hard work and motivation, but yes, they are bit players.Seriously. Low and middle income people are the biggest players in the economy since they don't spend that much less than high earners but make up a far, far larger proportion of the population. This guy is a total idiot.Yeah but they can always come back when shit gets to normalIt’s not all lay-off’s either. My company gave everyone a 15% pay cut in order to stay afloat. While I realize I’m very lucky to still have a job, it still has a big impact. Also adding onto this they gave no timeframe on when salaries would be back to normal, my fear is that even when/if they get through this they are going to try to milk the lower salaries for as long as possible.Those at the top are too high above the clouds to see or care about what is happening down below. Not until it affects them.Except Bezos gets Covid and he will just work from home still. Very little interruption.Why would we have an economic issue if Bezos gets sick? I think Amazon is such a behemoth at this point it could operate perfectly fine without Bezos. There's probably a team there determining which sectors and industries to dominate next.> Unemployment is up, but as a percentage of our economy we’re talking margin of error.

This makes no sense.  
 
A booming economy is 5% unemployment rate.   A terrible recession is 10% unemployment rate.   Today we have a 11.1% unemployment rate.   For most of us, that is the highest unemployment we will see in our lifetime.  
  
Lots of waiters earn over US median household income ($60k).   They aren't all poor.  
  
People are confused because we are so EARLY in the recession.   There will be enormous waves of white collar layoffs, as companies feel the effects of the economic problems.   
  
Small businesses for the past few months had the federal government paying their employee salaries.   That is about to end, so the true unemployment rate is obfuscated by zombie jobs.Lol, what?

Do you really think Amazon just ceases to function when Bezos is sick?>Bezos gets covid and we’re in a recession. He’s worth more than about half the country combined.

That's not how worth works for the ultra rich.  Bezos only loses his wealth if amazon goes up in steam, and all those working individuals \*are\* amazon.  Amazon only goes up in smoke when the workers at amazon can't do their job anymore, which they largely have been able to.

That people  are still working is a sign the economy is still alright.  

It won't be once the foreclosures start, but for now it's running.Bezos could drop dead right now and Amazon would be fine (after maybe a brief stock price panic). He’s already built the machine. It runs extremely well. No doubt he has some ideas on how to further grow the company, but he’s probably told his higher ups and no doubt someone else at Amazon also has plans. Economy wouldn’t even feel it.Economic impact is so little? This country is in for a very rude awakening.Bezos is really worth over half the country?Retail, real estate, education, manufacturing are all taking huge hits from this. This is not "margin of error." Do you seriously think software devs and engineers won't be laid off if these sectors plummet? There would be less demand for their services, so there would be layoffs. This is already happening, and it's going to get worse as the virus gets worse.Your submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*Have they? In my mind, seems like they rushed out a trillion dollar band-aid that did nothing to change our long term issues. COVID is still surging, there’s been no national plan of action, interests rates are at all-time lows and benefits/deferrals are about done.I think *you'd* be surprised.Ok, but let's set a definition for you being right, first.Of course it’s not “priced in” and that talk is kinda silly to me — to me, that’s just people trying to mask their insecurities with fake, smarmy confidence, looking for the illusion of control. If people read the news instead of just followed their gut, they’d know we have multiple documented cases of people who have gotten COVID twice already. Antibodies wear off in months, the virus can mutate just like the flu. There’s no guarantee a vaccine will be the magic bullet. There’s only so much hay you can throw on the horse.What do you mean? Why couldn't they just extended it after, or reiterate it?I develop drugs for a living. I completely agree people are overly optimistic. Even if we do get a vaccine approved in 2020 or 2021, there is no way I’m taking it. Typical development is 5-10 years; it’s physically impossible to asses safety in a 1-2 year timespan.

Especially in regards to Moderna’s mRNA vaccine. It is insane to me how many people are willing to inject themselves with foreign mRNA without understanding the risks and consequences.I'm a type 1 diabetic, diagnosed 14 years ago. When I was diagnosed I was told, "Don't worry, a cure is just 10 years away!" Well, fourteen years on and a cure is still just ten years away.

I will say however, advances in technology within those ten years have meant my longterm complications will likely drop to near zero over my lifetime thanks to better monitoring and control. My gut feeling is that's where we'll get with COVID. No cure, but great management with no long term impacts. Maybe a COVID season like we have flu season, which is tragic on an individual level, but again, almost entirely manageable for a society as a wholeThe other issue is compliance. Wearing masks turned into a nationwide culture war, with some people getting killed over it. Assuming the vaccine works as expected (big if) we may not achieve herd immunity because not enough people will take. Ironically there will be those too uneducated to trust vaccines but also those educated enough to know the risks of a fast-tracked vaccine“But maybe if we just hope hard enough....” 

Like, yes I know there will be a lot of red-tape cutting because it’s covid, but vaccines still take, on avg, [10-15 years to develop. ](https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/vaccine-development-testing-and-regulation)There is optimism because of the scientific data, not in spite of it.[removed]Rollout could be laterAre you kidding me? Google it. It's been everywhere in the newsThis is untrue, fortunately. The scientific community, detached from the media, is increasingly optimistic.> The latest viral strain of the coronavirus has already mutated so much that it is already very different from the February strain.

Not really.  The vaccines depend on the spije protein on the virus.  That has not changed through mutation or any other means.  The vaccines look very promising and there are many candidates.  I'm sure a few of them will fall flat on their face, but we don't need every single one to work to get a vaccine.  We just need 1 of them to work.  Ideally, we'd have at least 2-3 work so that we could significantly increase the speed at which people could get vaccinated.Do you have a source that definitively proves this and shows that the mutations will cause vaccines currently under development to be ineffective?Also there will be a huge gap between creating/discovering the viable vaccine, and then mass producing and distributing that vaccine. Could be another 3-6 month gap until vulnerable populations are vaccinated.Won't be a vaccine, but something to help you fight the virus off, or to give you a better chance when you get it. More like a defensive boostThe media doesn't report the false optimism to keep everyone's hopes up, it's to boost ratings. Same with all the negativity. It's getting to be so blatant, the for-profit sensationalism. On days the deaths are low they report the total infected, and visa versa when the deaths are high to keep the doom and gloom status quo. They then sprinkle in vaccine optimism for added entertainment value.* https://www.wsj.com/articles/pfizer-biontech-get-1-95-billion-covid-19-vaccine-order-from-u-s-government-11595418221?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=17

* https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-guide-to-coronavirus-vaccines-in-the-works-11595594845?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1I think the benefits need to scale with prior earnings.  Like you should get an extra $600 a week and end up making more on unemployment than you did when working.  They really to scale it so if you made more in your prior job you get paid more because your lifestyle costs more (mortgage rent etc)How about corporate debt and valuations? What about the consumer? Very dangerous just comparing the two periods without going into finer detail.*👀 Remember to type kminder in the future for reminder to be picked up or your reminder confirmation will be delayed.*

That said, that's a lot of Remind Mes! for one comment

The stale thing would be going around in circles arguing with another person's imagined future not matching your imagined future.It’s so easy. Just get out before the crash. Fool proof.But if there is hyper inflation, you will want to stay in the market in solid companiesyeah everyone throws a different prediction, one of them is bound to be right soThe calm before the storm.ok u/jizz_on_her_faceIf Trump can be a President. I can be anything.I .. DECLARE .. RECESSIONRemindMe! 6 monthsRemindMe! 2032He made a statement. The burden of proof is on him.

Are you saying rich people will sell stocks for food? They won't sell anything and the economy will catch up eventually.What if there's nothing else to pick ? Chinese yuan or Luckin Coffee Stock coupon ? Good luck with that ...Like what, the Euro? How about a Russian Ruble? Maybe even the Yuan. Point is all the alternatives are much less trust worthy compared the the USD, and we have the big stick to back it up.Go ahead and put your money in another currency then, oh wait they're all doing it.why would countries default as we print more money and our interest rates approach 0?Would it turn the US into king of exports though?Eh, no one can call the US out on its credit limit. For one thing, everyone is also printing money. And we’re just replacing lost income temporarily so core inflation doesn’t seem too big a risk. It feels like the fed pretty much handled it at the expense of savers holding cash and not assetsI don’t think that limit will be hit any time soonNo one will believe this until we enter another major crisislol, as if the fed is ever going to be able to raise interest rates. these are here to stay, brother.Hold up. 

The mantra of this sub for the last 5 months has been "the stock market is not the economy." The argument has always been that yeah the economy is terrible but it doesn't matter because it's all temporary bc of the virus. Now *you're* the one confusing the stock market for the economy. 

There was NOT a v shaped recovery. The economy is still in the shitter. The *market* might have recovered quickly, but those two aren't the same thing. Right? That's what all the bulls keep saying...the bears are spot on about main street. it’s hell for common people. 

it just so happens that wall street continues to function. wild stuff.No eventually they'll be right, and will let you know when that happens.  The real issue here is not who's right and who's wrong.  The entire point is making money.  So when all is said and done, all you have to do is compare performance to see who "won".I don't get why it always boils down to a Bears VS Bulls fight with some of you people. 

Do you literally know nothing about economics? Does the state of the economy and the current situation with coronavirus really scream to you that the US stock market should be near ATHs?"Not wrong just early" (something I've read by bears on this sub this year, last year and 5 years ago.)It won't go up in perpetuity. Surely you realize that? At some point they will be right. The question is when and the answer is no one knows for sure. But it wouldn't hurt to hedge a bit in my opinion.In fire management, there's a core understanding that you can have many small fires or a large catastrophic fire. I'm old enough to remember that the economics bailouts of 2008 led to the euro zone crisis.

Fire and wall street panic have a lot of similarities.Remindme! 3 monthsRemindme!  2 YearsThis thread is strange to me. Thanks to Tech, Amazon, Tesla etc my portfolio has been lookong great. If you bought the dip in March, you should have made money. How on earth is OP comparing this to 2008?And impatient bulls are too quick to say we're over the worst of it. Still in the first wave of covid-19 during the summer and the numbers continue to skyrocket. The party just started as far as I'm concerned.It's infuriating just how toxic and persistent the hive mind of this sub can be.  It's like any and all challenges to the accepted dogma need to be ridiculed and torn down.Could you expand on this? I was too young to understand a lot of what was going on economically in 08. I know the basics and cause, but not much about the stimulus or the lingering effects.The 10 bagger growth from 1929 was all a lie. We should be driving Model As stillWe are still in the tulipmania bubble, just you waitMaybe they’ll want to bail out the ol’ US of A by paying some taxes? Nah, they’ll do stock buybacks and distribute dividends to themselves until our last infrastructure week.Corporations are getting loans, which they will have to pay back *unless* they use the money for employees.Aka "the bag Holder"It’s not even rich people as much as huge swaths of industries. My business relies on tourism, so I’m screwed, but lots of my friends haven’t been impacted at all. They might be working from home, but few layoffs in:

Health care
Education 
Government
Banking/financials 

Pretty much everyone with an office job is fine. (Not even tech. Think telcos, the gas companies etc.)

I think that’s why it does seem different than 2008. Some businesses are thriving due to the shutdowns. What was a safe haven industry in 2008? Bankruptcy law?Let me tell you about 1913 and when the federal reserve was created by Illuminati rising down from the sky on their flying Tyrannosaurus rexs.  Our economy has been propped up by alien invaders since then manipulating our economy and thoughts.  

Wake up sheeple. Buy gold and bitcoin.I'm secure enough to admit I don't know what will happen in the future. You seem to have it all figured out.Yep. Went from mortgage backed securities to rent backed securities. Housing still super inflated. Job market bleak for anyone without a professional degree... deja what?Will the Brexit chickens *finally* come home to roost? I don't see anyway the UK doesn't feel massive pain from totally upending their economy. And to your point, that might be 5X worse doing it during a pandemic.> We have breached the 90% level, we don’t want to be adding and adding to that for low ROI public spending, that will only compound the crisis

In fairness, Growth in a Time of Debt has had a hard few years. Your economist link from 2013 is covering the whole excel/aggregation error controversyIn fairness, the US hasn't been hit as hard economically as most other countries. Europe GDP projections contracted -7.5%, Canada -6.2%, UK -6.5%, the US is currently only projected to be about -5.9%... These are all imf numbers.

I don't think there was a way to really avoid damage, even if your country handled it better, we're too connected to not feel the impact economically. You mention New Zealand, but their GDP is projected to slide -7.2% for 2020. Singapore was applauded for their reaction, but their GDP is projected to slide -4 to -7%. I can't find South Korea's 2020 projections, but they've also just entered into a recession anyway and they're the ones that handled this the best.I just wish I knew what to do with my money. Precious metals at all time highs, gov bonds (funds) at all time highs, stocks have an impending meltdown, cash (especially the dollar) under a similar doom.... Maybe I should just buy lottery tickets.[removed]Your submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

The recession started way before Obama's first term in 2009, officially lasting from December 2007 to June 2009 per the standard economist definition (two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP growth), with its effects lingering for a few years into Obama's term.  Things were already looking bad in late 2007, prompting George W. Bush to sign the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 into law in February 2008.  Things worsened when Bear Stearns collapsed in March 2008, which was enormous news at the time, and prompted an emergency loan from the Fed. Lehman collapsed in September 2008, which prompted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 creating the $700B TARP program.  That act was signed into law by president George W. Bush in early October 2008.  Obama's first term began in January 2009.

|-|-|-|-|I mean the Fed actually did raise rates several times - and debt service ratios didn't budge. Of course if you raise interest rates enough you'll get adverse effects. But you have to examine the chance of that happening (zero) and whether its good policy for it to happen (it isn't).You don't think currency debasement is a reason to be negative? So they can keep printing infinite money and no worries.



*right* > If you don’t think record stock indexes, low unemployment, low inflation and low interest rates is representative of a a great economy then I don’t know what fantasy world you’re living in.


 People were saying the same thing in 2006. That's why speculative bubbles are so damned attractive.Yes. They put a hold on evictions and no one paid bills. The defaults haven't happened yet. Which is one reason the stock market has held up. The idea was everything would be back to normal before the reckoning comes. That's why the $600/wk extra and stimulus checks. If those stop, then everything collapses. The only problem is, the $600 is more than people made before, so no one wants to go back to work. They made their own mess. They will try to prop it up until the election. Then you are on your own. Don't be surprised when the magical vaccine that was promised by Nov 3rd, suddenly is found not to work so well after Nov 4th.Depends on the state.  Many will have another week.I'm only 1 FEMA scandal away from a bingo, fingers crossed.Cascadia subduction zone earthquake would do it too.2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season is just about to start.

Let's see what we can stir up!George Bush doesn’t care about black peopleYeah I just need natural disaster to complete my “wtf” bingo for 2020I'm holding an alien invasionGotta catch them all, Pokemon!The dam is in China how can it affect events here in the States ? The dam should break and wash China to sea for all I care.Bloody Mormons..Trump* virus. Your lack of education is showing.I guarantee that there will be no vaccine.Recessions take a while to hit people, outside of the people directly affected by the initial wave. In 2008, the people directly affected were anyone real estate/banking related. In 2020, the people directly affected were anyone restaurant/bar/entertainment related.Your dad May have fucked your mom one year, but you weren’t born until the following year. Crazy how that happensI agree with you partly but Portland has shown that many all over the spectrum have gathered to protestYou have figured out the truth about the uni-party. Congrats.It has been nowhere near a million (under 300-400k combined) that number is sheer propaganda and no better than Trump's lies.  The Iraq body count project and the UN both have been counting.

[https://www.iraqbodycount.org/](https://www.iraqbodycount.org/)

[https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/02/1057921](https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/02/1057921)Yeah I apologize,  it's a bad habit lolThat's a good point, but I wonder if they'll react the same way in China, completely different society over there. Stricter security as well.  Never really considered the persecution of the Uighurs, is China going to invade the Middle East next?Cmon man, he called that out in his comment. White ppl are never classified as terrorists in the media/by politicians, they're just called "unstable". The parent comment specifically referenced "Islamic terrorism".https://www.amazon.com/Terror-Factory-Inside-Manufactured-Terrorism/dp/1935439618

finding no terrorist cells (in whichever group) means no promotion.Maybe stop invading their homelands you scumbag foreigner"Did you just regard the US as one of the least racist countries? I won’t even school you on that."

You won't school anyone on it because you can't, factually. Pointing out "disparities" (I'm sure that's where you'd start) is the typical fallacious talking point of people who call the U.S. racist.

BLM and those who support them care as much about Floyd/Taylor as they do the 17 people (some children) that were recently killed in a single weekend in Chicago, meaning not at all. No one living in or near the inner cities are looking over their shoulders for policeman or white supremacists, we know who the most dangerous individuals are in these environments.Right, CNN couldn't have done a better job. Completely political and out of touch with reality.Management at my company just said to expect a very tough 2021 even though the shutdown itself didn’t affect our revenue at all. Some of our main clients are municipal governments and many of them are facing budgetary issues.there is a bank or two (globally) that are going under next year, it takes awhile to sniff out things like lehman brother, bernie madoff or enron but you can't ever say we had a financial crisis without examples like those popping upOkay, so there won't be evictions where everyone lives, just landlords declaring bankruptcy. Everyone remain calm! This is fine for the economy!I'm so sorry. Tenants that aren't paying rent will not be evicted. Economy is saved. You're so pedantic you've missed the entire boat on what the end of the 600/wk will do to the economyIts just not as quick to happen and with the unemployment benefits the impact to the economy has been muted.  
It takes a while for that chunk of the population to stop spending, takes a while for that reduction in spending to impact big companies bottom lines, and the market seems to be both short sighted (high frequency econ data reaction) and super long (2021 earnings don't matter?).Half of employment is small business, but it doesn't come close to half the economy.The reason they're not receiving the bulk of PPP has little to do with their actual economic impact.

It's more to do with lawyers getting in the paperwork faster, lobbyists helping craft the bill in the first place, and banks having a preference for their larger clients or other biases.They did get most of PPP. Publicly traded companies only netted a tiny percentage. I agree PPP was not appropriately tailored, but the worst offenders are smallish employers in professional services (investment firms, lawyers, accountants, etc.) who did fine and had most of their payroll covered anyhow. Would have been better to make the loans 0 interest and forgive based on net revenue declines or something similar.So by your rationale, you are arguing that Congress always allocates funding appropriately?  The fuck outta here.What publicly traded company received ppp loans?Or they’re doing it wrong....Yep, it's always best to stay in touch and not feel like you're somehow above all this because you're definitely not unless you're maybe an executive or influential leader. Don't push luck.

 Pay cuts sound terrible. My company stopped matching for 401ks a few months ago, and I thought that was bad.They didnt do it to stay afloat, they did it because they could get away with it. Its a textbook result in recessions oversaturating the labor market. Same thing happened in the great depression[removed]And it did for several months while Bezos was on vacation.  He has an excellent leadership team.  [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) and AWS have actual divisional CEOs that are wholly responsible for running them.

Amazon could run itself.  Bezos sets the principles and values from the top and arbitrates strategic decisions.  One of those values that he like to talk about is Customer Obsession, which guides every decision.  This is why amazon has such excellent customer service, such a great return policy, why their products are so damn cheap, why we get 1-day delivery, and... why warehouse workers get paid so little.The majority of items on Amazon is Chinese garbage.



Amazon could be in big trouble if things continue to heat up; as would every peddler of Chinese crap.A team? Try tens of thousands of teams[Yeah, some people would argue that Amazon looks at their customers data to find their next products.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23929044)This is the right answer. It doesn’t seem that bad because no one has come to collect the checks yet. Student loans are still in forbearance, the fed gov is still supplementing unemployment, etc. 

And we haven’t even seen the obvious and inevitable second covid spike that comes during flu season (this is to say -nothing- if there happens to be a natural disaster like a hurricane in, say, Florida with its already extremely high infection rate).  

We know there’s income inequality greater now than since before the Great Depression but I’m telling you things are going to get a lot worse and sooner than we think. There are going to be a lot of people living out of their cars.[removed]$60k is really nothing in terms of the economy unless you ignore income inequality.

Also keep in mind: that's just income, not net worth which is even more extreme.  The actual amount of money controlled by someone earning <$100k is peanuts in our economy today.  And what those people do have, they don't even control. It's mostly sitting in investments like 401(k)'s which are controlled by the a handful of fund managers.  Or sitting in assets like homes.

The amount of money the average person contributes to the economy today is insanely small.

The economic impact of the bottom 50% of Americans is at this point pretty much insignificant. They own so little it doesn't really register.

Go back 30 years, and the bottom 50% absolutely had an impact.Wait Bezos doesn’t ship out all those packages by himself?It would create a lot of panic.  He's essentially what Steve Jobs was to Apple, and similar to Tom Hanks, his getting sick would make a lot of people pause.

Don't have to like it, but the reality is, that would have a measurable impact on the economy.  His demise would as well. Big questions would come up about leadership, splitting up the company (and the precedent that could set for other tech companies like Google and Microsoft) which would have material impacts on NASDAQ.

Also keep in mind his ex-wife joined the Giving Pledge to give most of her wealth away.  Jeff's a notable holdout. Nobody besides him and his lawyers have any idea what that money will do when he's gone or where it goes.  Could be a mega charity, could be a mega investment firm in his name run by someone not publicly named yet. Or both.

Edit: Ex-wife.Expand on that?The median savings in the US is about $5,000. Its not that hard to believe.Not that surprising when you think about it. If you have 1 cent, you are worth more than roughly 20% of the country who have negative networth. Followed by a lot of people with barely any assets. Doesn't take much.Feds can't exactly solve the virus, but they can provide short-term liquidity which will keep employers afloat until someone else does. If hospitality and retail had a huge string of bankruptcies and closures unemployment would be much higher and recovery would wind up taking significantly longer. So yes, I would say the financial response to the recession was significantly better than the last one (although far from perfect).

Now the Federal government's response to COVID itself is *far* from as well executed but I'll leave that for another sub.If those people weren't economically relevant, then you should probably tell everyone over on /r/landlord to shut the fuck up, because their tenants' missed rent payments are not economically significant. Landlords are LOSING THEIR MINDS claiming the nonpayment of rent and the inability to evict is an absolute calamity and their are now RUINED financially.

You can tell them "Don't worry, none of that unpaid rent has an actual impact on the economy :D"They end this weekend, needs to be done todayI'm also in drug development, and agree people are being too optimistic, but why wouldn't you want to take Oxford's Ad vector vaccine? I understand the Moderna skepticism completely, even though mRNA theoretically should be pretty safe.

I think I'd be willing to get an inactivated viral vaccine or an Ad vector vaccine even with an accelerated timeline. Moderna as a company sketches me out though. They need that 5-10 year development timeline.I also am in drug dev and I don't really see a mechanism for long term side effects of an mRNA injection that wouldn't also be present in the actual viral infection. Maybe the engineered lipids in the capsid but again it's cleared so quickly and is pretty similar to native vesicles. Most bad vaccine ADEs have been adjuvant related or because they were live attenuated (ex polio vac). Not saying you're unreasonable to be cautious but I don't think that getting infected is less uncertain, especially because you're getting the foreign mRNA anyway.

Edit: for an example of corollary long term effects, there's some compelling evidence that the autoimmune issues seen in the wake of h1n1 vaccine campaigns occur after h1n1 infection as well.I'm in Canada and I think we'll have the luxury of letting other people guinea pig the vaccene before it becomes a problem here, so I'm on board with not taking this until you need to. BUT with that said, if I was in the US I'd probably be wondering whats riskier. Covid or a half tested vaccine.

Everything I've read about mRNA is that it will be a far safer method then the old ones (in theory, being its a new technology).  You might be better off gambling with this tech then the more traditional shots.> I develop drugs for a living

Then you should know that the 7-10 year life-cycle includes significant time devoted to manufacturing/distribution and waiting for regulatory bodies to respond.  All activities that are being fast-tracked for this vaccine.

Furthermore the Oxford vaccine is a modification of the MERS vaccine.  Multiple MERS vaccine clinical trials have been held around the world since 2016.  

After reading some of your other responses in this thread, I seriously doubt you're a scientist.Just because you operate a plate reader doing HTS to pay your mortgage doesn't make you an expert on vaccine safety: the two things are pretty unrelated.    We can get a pretty good idea of a vaccine's safety in the time span we have.   If a vaccine doesn't cause acute effects on injection (existing phase I studies with the COVID vaccines have shown that these are not too bad), and there's no evidence that antibody-dependent enhancement is occurring in COVID (if this was occurring, wouldn't convalescent serum worsen the disease symptoms, and aren't strong antibody-dependent enhancement effects more of a flavivirus thing anyway), what risks could be foreseen?  

I am getting the vaccine as soon as I can.This is dangerous nonsense to be putting on a public forum. With people like you,  even if we have a vaccine, we still have a problem as you will discourage the vulnerable from getting it. These vaccines are going through the very same safety testing as any other would, but you should know that since you say you work in pharma. If they make it through phase three testing, which is far from guaranteed right now, they are safe. The reason most vaccines take longer is because they receive a small fraction of the financial backing that covid vaccines currently in development do.Or just contract covid like me and get natural antibodies>it’s physically impossible to asses safety in a 1-2 year timespan.

Wouldn't it be possible to give the vaccine candidate to like 10,000 people in parallel and then see after 3 month if there were any side effects and test if the 10,000 people are now immune by trying to infect them with Covid?

From the ethical part aside, why wouldn't that work? I'm only an engineer so maybe I'm too dumb for this stuff, but I just can't see why that procedure would not work!

Thanks.Considering the way people like Fauci have been acting (literally lying to the public about masks for "the greater good"), I personally wouldn't put it past them to push a mandatory vaccination. I realize there is a lot of conspiracy theories going around right now, but I'm not talking about that, I'm just talking about simple hubris.

I feel like the public would go along with almost anything at this point just to get the economy back open, which is exactly my problem because that is a huge conflict of interest. We have people in power who I'm sure **literally** get high off playing the role of "savior" and are giddy at the prospect of forcing something on the public. These are unfortunately the same kind of people who don't take shutting down the economy seriously because they don't think there are any real consequences of having the central bank print money to cover the costs. It is a huge conflict of interest.Phase 2 trials are not a reason to be overly optimistic. It's subjective, but to many people very little optimism is warranted. There's no evidence of longterm efficacy yet, and no guarantee they won't cause serious harm to a large percentage of people who take it.

There are plenty of good reasons these trials usually take a decade and it's not for lack of funds or willpowerYour submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*No, I am not kidding you, because I read no such thing. Can you please provide two reputable sources?Do we have a source that proves that a majority of the population will take the vaccine. A poll recently showed 44% of republicans believe Bill Gate's vaccine is a conspiracy to microchip us. So if 60-70% of the population is vaccinated is that enough to achieve herd immunity?Do you have a source that any of the vaccines are not already ineffective?I think production will be very fast. Never in our history have we had the entire planet focused on producing one single product.Candidate vaccines are already being mass produced as we speak in preparation for the green light.You realize governments are giving these companies grants to begin mass producing the vaccines months before they complete phase 3 trials.  There will be hundreds of millions of doses produced by the time they complete phase 3 trials.It would be dangerous for someone to make allocation changes based on looking at individual sectors of the economy. But I didn’t suggest doing that. I was just pointing out specific sector differences between early in 2008 recession and 2020 recession.> Coming back later to see how well it aged is the only way to do it. 

Why?

Also, if it's actually that important then man up and make you're own counter prediction as well.And then just buy again when the market reaches its trough. I don’t know why more people don’t try this strategy.do you think equities would keep up in such an event? im not aware of a suitable case study where this has indeed happenedA broken clock is right twice a day.[deleted]They were saying this every year from like 2010-2015. I’ll believe it when I see it.Yeah the next leg down is coming.... any day now...It's very possible. We might see the true consequences of this in a year from now. Huge amount of small businesses dying, unsustainable debt, banks going down, markets collapsing. Very weak Dollar, which is already showing in the insane rise in precious metals. I'm scared, I really am.This sub has been saying this for 5 years nowWhy are you booing him, hes right!r/unexpectedofficeRemindMe! 8 MonthsRemindMe! 6 monthsYou can't really argue a prediction into happening. It'll either age well, which means that everyone going "WELL PROVE IT" will look stupid in hindsight or it'll age badly, which means they'll look appropriately sceptical.

People will act according to their predictions and time'll tell who was on the right track.There shouldn't be a single, nationalized reserve currency.  That's... sort of the point of all of this.  It will be a basket of many currencies, including cryptocurrencies like BTC and AMPL.Not me personally, but there's speculation that reverting back to gold standard is a possibility, and with the recent surge in precious metals and gold/silver leading the pack, we're starting to see market indicators aligning with that narrative.CryptoThe point is that while USD is the most trust worthy, printing that amount of money will make USD less trust worthy so people will try to decrease their dependency of USD. Also using a big stick to back it up is the exactly the opposite of being trust worthy.Because we devalue the currency, but their debt level remains the same.  Their dollars no longer service the debt like it did before the printing, but the amount of the debt is the same, and they're not getting any of the fresh print.

Now, there's discussion that the Fed will open dollar swap lines, but of course those can only do so much.  If you are a country with dollar debt and need dollars through the swap line, you are still going to have to print a bunch of your own failing currency (that's not in demand like the dollar is and the printing of which will cripple your own domestic economy just to pay down USD debt).

So the more we print, the more it breaks the back of these countries. Even if we open swap lines, they still get a raw deal.  The DXY is going to spike and these countries will default, ditch the dollar, and never look back.  It would be the rational thing to do.Exactly. Those cattier battle groups aren’t just for strictly military means. 

Power projection, trade protection, etc all enable the US to essentially do what it wants (in the medium term). They could definitely do enough damage to themselves to lose that top position, but that’s highly unlikelyAnd inflation isn't generally that big of an issue unless the money isn't being spent.Surely at some point institutions will stop buying bonds, no? Less than 1% for 10 years already seems insane.OPEC can and will. Russia already wants to end the ties of oil to the USD.

If that happens, the economic destruction will be MUCH worse than any recession we would have if the fed backed off right now.Parent comment said "The market ", which I assume refers to the stock market?When the government is by and for the oligarchy, you can be sure the corporate socialism will continue as long as they can get away with it.>No eventually they'll be right

Yeah, you can say "market's gonna crash" every day for 20 years and then when it does scream "I TOLD YOU SO!" completely ignoring the 20 consecutive years that you were wrong. This sums up all market commentary.> The real issue here is not who's right and who's wrong. The entire point is making money. 

So the people who were buying in March and April were right and the people who were acting as if it was the apocalypse and anyone who was buying was an idiot because the market was going lower were wrong.  The people who have been bearish the whole time are wrong. This whole "ILL BE RIGHT EVENTUALLY" or "NOT WRONG, JUST EARLY" (and you can never be wrong, because it's always early) stuff is nonsense. "Oh, I missed this unbelievable muti-month rally that saw some growth funds up 50-60+% YTD and the S & P have the biggest 50 day rally in its history, but eventually I'll be right and the market will go down." Be flexible. People take such absurd pride in being "contrarian" and *completely* wrong - a large portion of this sub seems to think it's Michael Burry  - and missing a massive multi-month rally because you're a stubborn pessimist isn't something to be proud of.The stock market is just one big bull market. 

And let’s say, this is it. 

100 years of shit. 

Then, oh fucking well. 

There is nothing we can do. 

I have a feeling it’s not though. 

If you’re *investing*, just keep putting money in the market. If it goes down, double down. 

Pretend it’s like a sale at your favorite store and you got a gift card. 

If it goes up, nothing to worry about, enjoy your ride to the top. 

Just don’t pull out and sit on the sidelines. 

If you’re *gambling*, go to WSB.They’re already right. USD is falling into the shitter with rates already there and precious metals flying. This is not ending well.The market makes a lot more sense if you look at it by sector. 

Finance, industry, energy and small caps are still badly beaten down since they are more cyclical and better reflect the state of the economy.

Staples and healthcare have recovered since these are essentials and they'll be needed and profitable no matter the state of the economy.

Tech has made new ATH's due to an increased reliance on stay-at-home tech in order to keep things functioning. I can't say much for why stocks like TSLA are booming, but AMZN, ZM, MSFT soaring makes sense when their profits and future growth prospects have also improved.Considering the amount of stimulus and PPP loan money that has certainly found its way into the market by people/companies that didn't really need it, it's not shocking. It's all a house of cards though.>Does the state of the economy and the current situation with coronavirus really scream to you that the US stock market should be near ATHs?

Honestly, maybe.  Keep in mind that "the US stock market" typically refers to indices of large companies like the S&P 500 or the DJIA.  The crisis might kill the local book store down the street, but it probably won't kill Amazon.  Guess which company is part of the S&P 500.  

If the crisis kills small businesses and spending is diverted to the large businesses that comprise the stock market indices people focus on, that would justifiably push market valuations to all time highs.

Long story short, there is a ton of uncertainty out there.  One can make a real argument for future price increases just as easily as one can make an argument for future price drops.  If this was as simple as you think it is, I'd be retired on a beach right now.The market isn't a reflexion of current economy but a projection. When the average investor will lose every hope for a quick fix on coronavirus issue, then you'll get the right picture for the next couple of years.

I'm not a bear nor a bull, but I pray for a smooth decline of the market (to accumulate more) while I still have hope for our lives to come back to "normal" (I'm not for a vaccine, but for governments just to give up - which is an unpopular opinion and I might get downvoted for)The problem is that a lot of people (some members of my family included) pulled their money out during the crash and never got back in due to fear of another crash. As a result, they locked in all the losses and missed out on this rally of unknown length.> But it wouldn't hurt to hedge 

Tell that to all the bears holding cash and shorting the market for the past 5 months. It really hurt them.>I'm old enough to remember that the economics bailouts of 2008 led to the euro zone crisis.

And I'm old enough to remember that the eurozone crisis was led by *lack* of bailouts, which is why the US recovery was so much better. Remindme! 3 monthsI am actually.  1930 deluxe roadsterInfrastructure week... Now there's a reference I haven't heard in a while lolWe’re actually in the matrixOh for sure, Brexit + pandemic is the best combo. I'm a student nearing the end of studying and since march, I have been living with parents as everything stopped(Uni and work) so I went home to keep costs down yet I have been getting paid furlough during this time. I work part-time in a bar and I wouldn't say I am exactly valued in the business, yet they are giving me furlough and from what I have heard all other positions in the bar and its other locations have not let one person go. So if you add that up and the furlough scheme is being given to people like me, honestly I don't need the money but I take it, meanwhile unemployment in professional jobs in the same city is quite high and the same for people who cannot afford to pay their housing costs. It seems to me that the scheme is being used for the wrong people!

Add in the fact that we are about to get absolutely annihilated once the flu season starts up and all the folk who have been on holiday abroad come home. Then in terms of academia, the sudden influx of domestic students from all over the UK to the cities. We are setting it up for another lockdown but the Furlough scheme is not going to be used next time as its not feasible.

End all, yes **Brexit-Covid19** is the ticker event for fairly shafting the UK.RemindMe! 6 months🧐My two cents is to put the money in a breakable Fixed Deposit that earns a decent interest, or park the money in a Liquid Fund, or just have the cash in a saving account.

The irony is, all I’m seeing in a lot of news outlets and other places on Reddit is how republicans or the government as a whole needs to do more for people’s personal finances, how it’s unacceptable that there’s only been one stimulus check, etc - but I remember thinking “holy shit” when I saw the extra $600/week flat across the board... all these comments acting like the government has done nothing while they arguably are giving out too much money.

There is a much larger chance that the first vaccines will not be fully effective or will require boosters in a couple years.

Here in NYC, rents are way down and will likely drop even more as people move upstate. Retail businesses outside of grocery stores are still closed or have minimal customers. Tourism, one of our biggest industries, is completely dead. The protests died down here ages ago, but the economy is still fucked.And even a broken clock can be right twice a day.  Crazy how that happens.Note I said riot, not protest. People from all walks of life will gather to peacefully protest then go back to their lives afterwards. 

That said, Portland is really weird. In a lot of ways.Iraq Body Count has a famously narrow definition for war-caused civilian deaths, and is considered a vast undercount.

The highest counts for 203-2011 come from the Lancet and out the figure at 2 million (although they got there with really dodgy methodology, in my view).

The fact is we don’t know, but 500,000 - 1 million seems a pretty reasonable, even conservative, estimate...especially if one factors in all the deaths of the past decade.Sure, I’ll take “Iraq Body Count’s” word for it, thanks. Keep up the good work. Was the Holocaust only 4 million? Don’t answer that. Creep.Ehh, words change; they're fluid.

Uighurs were a very high component of ISIS though, will be interesting to see how if terrorist groups form. One of the checks against though, is that the Central Asian republics which actually have ethnic ties with Uighurs are much more stable than ME countries.

You really rolled with that initial assumption tho, good for you!I'm a landlord and have dealt with evictions many times (California).

People have some misconception about how evictions work. Like I can just goto the court house and file an Unlawful Detainer, and poof they are gone.

Even PRE-Covid19, evictions that you would think are slam dunk cases can take MONTHS, and thousands of dollars and legal expenses while you fight the tenant. In many cases, you end up PAYING the tenant to leave, even though they are 100% in the wrong!

Most big cities have passed moratoriums on evictions that are going to last a while. Even when those expire, the courts (which were already biased towards tenants), will slow things down even more.the us is barely getting any benefits compared to Canada lolSpecially if they earn more money unemployed. Look it up, people have spent MORE with the benefits. When they stop suckling at the states tit is when things will get ugly, or market crashes or dollar crashes. 

It's like that 3 Gorges Dam, you can stick a finger in the hole but it creates pressure elsewhere. Something will have to give.How much consumer spending comes from those employees?
Once they spend those dollars how far down the economic chain does that money flow.
If a lady at the nail shop loses her gig cause her store closed her local sandwhich shop gets hosed from selling less sandwhiches, her pay roll company takes a hit, the eletric company looses revenue, her nail polish company, the shippers and trucking etc etc etc. 
consumer spending is 70 gad damn percent of the US economy lets not pretend is the labor market goes tits up that its not going to do anything.If half of the consumers are small business workers, then eventually those people aren't going to have money to spend. Doesn't that money eventually work it's way up the chain? 

I think your comment does not acknowledge the very real connection between consumers and "the economy".That's not true.  Small business makes up 44% of US GDP.

I was trying to allude to the fact small businesses largely didn’t receive any help. The 3 to 10 employee mom and pops, than pay rent for their space and equipment, and are vital to most communities. These are the ones shutting down permanently because they received little to no help.Sir this is Reddit.It looks like close to 40 reported receiving loans. Some of the companies gave them back but only after they got called out publicly. I think Ashford Hospitality Trust was the largest of them.

I don't disagree that Bezos' death would cause chaos among Amazon's leadership. I just don't think it would have an impact on their bottom line, at least in the short-term.For one segment, evictions and foreclosures have been prohibited by law.

I went to a top school in the world for chemistry, have multiple ACS publications with hundreds of citations, and have been involved in successfully bringing two respiratory drugs to market and dozens of others up to Phase III.

The arrogance of Redditors 😂I personally manage $5 million in research contracts specifically for the development of respiratory drugs but you, a random on the internet, knows more than me. Okay bro.I’m all in favor of swift and generalized vaccination, but just passing phase 3 doesn’t guarantee safety. We’ve had very unfortunate examples of drugs whose long-term toxicity got revealed well into the pharmacovigilance phase (phase 4).For a few months... Are you back to 100%?There are things like degradation pathways, extractables and leechables, and container closure among several others that need long periods of time to asses.

There are certain ways of accelerating these studies such as through heat, intense light, or aspiration of the formulation but that is not a full substitute for understanding how the formulation interacts with excipients and packaging materials over long periods of time - especially for novel therapies.

The classic example of releasing a drug onto the market without fully understanding it’s characterization [is Thalidomide.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide)

The same applies to adverse health effects. You aren’t going to be able to fully understand the long-term possible health effects in 3 months no matter how large your initial sample size is.There’s no legal basis to do so but that won’t stop certain groups advocating for that approach. The irony of advocating for these mandatory measures in a time of increased awareness of police brutality is not lost on me.I didn't say I was **overly** optimistic. Yes, in the past vaccine development has taken a long time, and yes, there is bound to be a limited amount of extra risk because of the timelines here. That said though, and as someone else in the comments mentioned, never before has the entire world been so focused on solving a single problem. There's a first time for everything. There are also several promising candidates, at least one of which (ChAdOx) are based on existing vaccines which have significant clinical histories. Time will tell of course, but I see more reasons to be optimistic than pessimistic right now.https://www.google.com/amp/s/medicalxpress.com/news/2020-06-astrazeneca-track-virus-vaccine-september.amp

You'll be getting shots before the new year if you want them. The moderna vaccine isn't far behind eitherThis is a much better question than the nonsense I initially responded to.Dumbest comment in the chain award goes to...Too bad we never beat polio and smallpox.Agreed. Everyone says "well the fastest vaccine ever, mumps, took four years" without taking into account that that was 50 years ago, and I don't think the mumps pandemic was nearly this bad where practically every pharmaceutical research company was throwing practically everything they had at it.[deleted]>Never in our history have we had the entire planet focused on producing one single product.

The largest non-war effort in history by multiple magnitudes.Never in our history has there been a corona virus vaccine.> 
Also, if it's actually that important then man up and make you're own counter prediction as well.

And then what? That will tell us which of us is going to turn out to be right in two years?Oddly enough when I browse cars and especially motorcycles on FB marketplace, everything in my area is at least $1k more than it was this time last year.RemindMe! 12 monthsI’m in the process of purchasing a coop in NYC Suburbs and shit is flying off the shelf.Also if you've been paying attention the Fed is currently pulling out all the stops to keep things afloat.

What made 08 bad was the fed was running out of tricksSo many people who frequent this sub must be extremely wealthy, seeing as they seem to be able to predict the future with such confidence. I'd like to borrow their crystal balls.There wasn't a once in a century pandemic from 2010-2015. 

Like I'm not personally saying a massive recession is inevitable, but you're kidding yourself if you think this isn't any different than people predicting recessions 5-10 years ago.so will your portfolio.

Have a fair number of bonds and a little bit of gold in your portfolio at least.the market has a lot of uncertainty.

But you can't deny that compared to the last ten years, this years so far is so much worse and thus, has higher probability to pop the bubble.You wont see it until it is too late :([removed]Right as he is, he is yelling.  We use indoor voices here.RemindMe! 12 MonthsI like the concept of a global currency, but I can’t see there ever being enough political support to make it happen.Never gonna happen, but I still have a little bit in case it spikes when shit hits the fan again.Ok, so you sell your dollars to buy something else, what is it?All of this is arbitrary and the values are ultimately decided by people so— excuse the novice and possibly foolish question— why can’t governments of these countries and the US just DECIDE that printing more money won’t lead to any of this? Like rescale these arbitrary values?This kind of bullying sounds more like what China than a democratic country like the US.

If the US rules the world by bullying I wonder why the world would still see the US as the leader.Now people understand why our military budget is astronomically high, higher by at least double of any other country. We make the rules.It's very likely with China on its heelsBut the federal reserve is the one buying the bonds. They're creating money and buying treasuries and even corporate bondsDoesn’t russia have an economy that’s smaller than California by far?Russia is not part of OPEC and all the Arab states are very US aligned. 4 out of the top 5 (Saudi Arabia, Iraq, UAE and Kuwait) are US allies.You can add China and Iran to that list. Every country that's been economically sanctioned understand they need to get out of the USD denominated system.

By weaponizing the dollar under Obama and then used without descretion under Trump means that every country understand the risk associated with a continual USD dominance now. We've seeded the destruction of our greatest asset, and it will only take time for countries to react accordingly to their best interest.>You can't speak of this crisis as thought it's already behind us. The economic challenge has hardly even begun and the virus part is still getting worse by the week.

This is talking about the economy itself. It's absolutely true. We are still in recession. Millions of people are losing their jobs. Thousands of people are dying of covid everyday. The economy is in the shitter. That's a fact.

>The market has held up because the gov't is basically paying the bills of the unemployed. That isn't sustainable. I don't know how it ends but it will end somehow. That's the part that will probably be worse than 2008.

This is talking about the disconnect between the market and the economy. The only reason the stock market is doing well is because the Fed took unprecedented bold action to backstop the bond market. Also Congress managed to pass 2 relief bills and are working on a third. This virus isn't going away any time soon. A vaccine by EOY is an unrealistic pipe dream. And we're about to let enhanced UI benefits lapse? This fall/winter isn't going to be pretty.Somebody call Peter SchiffThe sun will burn out. If you think Im wrong, fight me.THISExcept in the last 20 years there wasn't a global fucking pandemic that has thrust entire industries on the brink of ruin with tens of millions on unemployment. What a stupid comparisonWinter is coming; sooner or later, the Starks are always rightHowever you can say that the market is likely to go down from prices it has recently beenBut did you sell before the rally and buy in at the lows? Will you sell before the next crash if it is indeed imminent? Just as permabears are standing on the sidelines missing out on growth permabulls are bragging about gains that will evaporate.Cough, cough, Peter Schiff, cough>This whole "ILL BE RIGHT EVENTUALLY" 

\- Don TrumpYou're right in a macro sense. If I had 100 years not just to live but enjoy that money i would be investing differently. But, I want my gains to be higher threshold so I can enjoy the money. Not that I'm not enjoying playing the markets, but I hate the thinking that you're not risking anything. Whether at wsb or putting money in CDs, you're still opening up yourself to risk. If you're strategy is 4-6% until you can retire I guess that's a strategy. Not a smart one in my opinion but we will have different targets.You're a fool if you think any government is essentially going to announce, "Get it over with and just die already," to its citizens.Some of us have put money in the market in march and removed in june. I just don't see the pandemy getting better in october so I prefer to stay back and have some put ready.That's not a hedge, that's not even investing, it's just gambling.

A hedge is being invested and holding uncorrelated (or inversely correlated, e.g. put options on the assets you own) assets.Lol really?

Yeah, as someone who did this I have to agree.  I'm an irrationally risk-averse person and have kept what little IRA savings we have parked in cash since March, waiting for the markets to bottom out.  I feel like such an idiot.  Scratch that, *am* such an idiot.  The flipside is that I don't have to worry about timing my exit, but I missed out bigtime on massive gains...Your submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

edit: decided to give that one a sub. Ever since I moved from TN to NM I've been lacking in my tropical storm/hurricane updates. Nobody cares out here lolLol. This is kind of stuff is exactly why people don't respect Trump supporters. You think you're being so logical, so rational. We all hear the way he says *Chinese* virus. Sure you can make some argument about it on paper and feel like you're being really clever. Here's a pat on the back and a cookie. But this is the real world lol. People know. This kind of stuff just makes everyone laugh at you behind your back even more.Maybe the difference is that the industries being targeted typically hire lower income earners. In 2008 it was banking and real estate, then it trickled down. 

This one will trickle up.Oooo tell me more about living in Manhattan at a discount!  I want in on that, I would love to live in the city.Don’t let facts get in the way of your lies.  The President sure doesn’t.

Funny how you also ignore my link about the UN.Thank you :)I'm not sure a word with two opposite definitions is meaningful. It makes the word literally meaningless.I am disputing none of that. I'm so sorry I mentioned evictions. I have gotten so many paragraphs from you people on the nuances of what evictions look like. 

What I meant to say was that millions of Americans are going to have $47 billion less dollars to spend per month so before you go thinking this is better than 2008, wait to see what happens after people can't make their debt obligations.So you’re saying suckling at the state’s tit helps the economyI agree with your point and statement, but people who are accepting unemployment benefits aren't _suckling_ at the state's tit.  It's a fun phrase, just kinda makes people down on their luck sound bad.I can't imagine an economy where people wouldn't pay other people to make them a sandwhich.  whether is for Bitcoin, gold or ammunition, sandwhiches are getting traded.  And whatever currency works best will get used.  Thats Visa right now, and probably my lifetime.  ammo is heavy.Don't worry, Jeff Bezos will just get more manicures to make up the difference.I meant the government/Fed (not the small businesses).

My point is that just because the PPP happened, doesn’t mean that money went where it needed to.... but it got where it was intended to go...Ah yeah makes sense. I wish you luck and many future raises :)what did he say?Do they somehow have a document that shows the organization structure and explains thousands of decisions that were made all over the world in all their company parts, so that new managers could be trained and take over some day? Or is all the knowledge how Amazon is working just in the heads of the existing management team or maybe just in Bezos's head?...fortunately!

(I'm an Amazon stock holder.)All companies pay cost of labor, which is very different from cost of living.  Labor is stupid cheap and in abundant supply.From what I've heard, the white collars get paid well but are completely overworked leading to higher turnover rates than average.Amazon's benefits for software engineers (white collar) pale in comparison to other top tech companies. Their 401k match is pitiful, the salaries are relatively lower compared to Google, FB, Microsoft, etc. and their RSU vesting schedule is awful (you don't get 80% of it unti your third and fourth years). They're stingy across the board, one of their Leadership Principles is literally "Frugality"....not to mention the Amazon reputation of overworking their white collar employees as well, as the other reply mentioned.Their engineering salaries are not high vs comparable companies.Aren't they setting the "market rate"? They're such a huge company, with huge influence, they're a big part of the "market". They massively help set the status quo on pay.I somewhat agree with the previous commenter's sentiment, but not quite to the same extent. There definitely is a difference between now and '08. A much larger portion of the lower incomes had disproportionate control over larger capital thanks to the poor lending practices of that time. A loss of low income jobs then meant large amounts of mortgages defaulting. Today it means a large amount of missed rental payments. 

That isn't to say we can't reach the same result especially if the higher earners depend on the low income renters to make their payments, but things are slightly more buffered in this way. At least that's how I see things.Eyeballing the tables [here](https://www.bls.gov/cex/2018/combined/decile.pdf) (PDF) it looks like the bottom 50% of 'consumer units' are responsible for a little under 30% of consumer spending. Which in turn is about 70% of GDP. So their spending accounts for about 20% of GDP.

They're not a massive slice of the US economy, but still quite significant. I also agree that there are significant knock-on effects from their plight that are worrisome for the broader economy, like societal instability, strain on the safety net, and belt-tightening by companies in staffing, inventory levels, and investment.Jobs spent a few years sick and grooming an obvious successor. Bezos has made no indication of the same.

Apples and Oranges.Why would you leave that much money in an account that you perform transactions out of? This seems so idiotic.You should probably flip those numbers.Sure but it also doesn't take much. It is a dramatic and misleading way to represent wealth. 

Another equally useless and dramatic way of stating this world be: Every single of the millions of people in the 20th percentile of wealth have more money than the entire bottom 20% of the population.that's an awfully small sample size you got there, friend.

And is that rental income economically significant such that you would notice it disappearing?

are you arguing that these people are not economically relevant or that they are not in an economically precarious situation? because there's a LOT of squawking over on the landlord subreddit about how other tenants that aren't YOUR tenants are NOT paying rent, and it seems your argument shifted from "these people being destitute won't matter" to "these people aren't destitute" and those are completely different statements.It's not really an arbitrary deadline, because those receiving the benefits will stop receiving them immediately once they end. Those people will be up the creek until they come up with a new plan to extend them.No, having different opinions about something like this is not fine when other people's lives are on the line. Why would you rather contract the virus than get vaccinated? I'm surprised to hear this from someone who is actually in the industry.

You're not just getting vaccinated to protect yourself. Mass vaccination is required to achieve herd immunity and nip this thing in the bud. Sure we should try to vaccinate high-risk individuals first, but for long term herd immunity and a complete return to normalcy you should get vaccinated and encourage your peers to do the same.

Plus, getting a vaccine is likely to induce stronger protection than contracting the virus itself (we still don't know if this will be the case. Oxford's IgG neut Ab titers look to be on par with those who were infected).And despite all that experience you’re woefully ignorant about the SARS-Cov vaccine development.  Any scientist with half a brain could look up the multiple published studies dating back to 2016. Yet you’re on here talking nonsense about a 1-2 year timeline.What are your actual credentials, though?  You sound like a dumbass from the way you talk about development timelines.

We're not letting SARS-CoV-2 rage for 5-10 years lolYeah, and we're not talking about a GLP-2 type scenario where chronic administration of a drug with ancillary activity at a different receptor increases cancer risk.   This is a totally different type of therapy.So there's a big IF - IF the vaccine works. I would not be surprised if it didn't.

Also, from the second article:

A researcher at Oxford University in the U.K. said on Monday that a million doses of its experimental COVID-19 vaccine could be produced by September, but experts say it’s unlikely they will be administered until next year.Why would our number be so low?

The biotech companies are already starting production of vaccine candidates and are estimating 300 million in 2020 and a billion in 2021 production.  From a single company.  

Also we aren't vaccinating the entire planet.  The first world will develop it and will definitely give it to their citizens first.  Other countries can either make it themselves or wait.Look we're not aiming to get the entire globe vaccinated.  A few things here, #1 we might have 3,5, 10 proven vaccines by mid-late next year.  #2 there's plenty of capacity to do more than one million per day - doses for vaccines are small.  #3 herd immunity is probably ~60% of the population.  #4 you probably won't have to vaccinate a significant number of people who have already had the virus to reach herd immunity. #5 from an American or European prospective, life returning to normal doesn't need the whole globe vaccinated.

A vaccine will be available in Europe and the US first and will spread out from there.That's exactly the point that I'm makingIt's still really early in the recession. People think they are getting deals now because people need to sell, yet there is plenty of cash to go around, mostly due to the stimulus and unemployment. The cash is slowly going to consolidate to the rich people over the next 6 months and most regular people will be hurting. 

IDK how this ends, I just know there is a ton of uncertainty. We also haven't seen the big weak companies fail, and there are a lot that are on the chopping blocks.Inventory is very low.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*RemindMe! 12 monthsWhy is that necessary?It has already been discussed, IMF Laggard talked about international crypto currency as the most global currencies lose value.I don't know how to answer that because it's really about an overall loss of trust. We've weaponized the SWIFT system for years, held countries hostage with dollar debt, and now we're buying up zombie debt, printing like mad, and crushing some of the emerging and middle economies, and more are going to struggle under the weight of their debt until they just give up and then they will not want dollars and rather have bother currency option where their purchasing power can't be printed away out of their control. And that will create a vacuum of demand that will plummet the currency regardless of what governments do.  They can't force people to trust the currency after all of this.  There are some great discussions I've seen on youtube between macro analysts who just can't see a solution out of this where the US can continue to be the world bank.  And when that day comes, there will be a vacuum of lost demand and basket of other currencies and options for people to put their money in after their bad taste in the mouth from the USD and all the debt and printing and sheer hubris.  

It's sort of like the US finally has to regress to the mean in a way, but that is going to feel catastrophic to many, I think. China has massive debt problems too thoughI’m talking about all of OPEC and Russia is one of the most powerful countries in that group. So it doesn’t really matter what their overall economy is, just how much oil they produce.They are still in OPEC+>I don't know how it ends but it will end somehow. That's the part that will probably be worse than 2008.

from the original comment and

>This fall/winter isn't going to be pretty.

from yours are exactly what I'm talking about. You keep making predictions about how bad the market is gonna get and how the worst is yet to come the same way bears have always done. Might happen, might not happen, but the fact is that doomsayers have missed out on massive gains and they will never admit they were wrong.This made me lol.

Why anyone listens to that man is beyond me.

Bears need their biases confirmed I guess.Negative, the sungod told me "we gud"the heat death of the universe will happen. for that reason, we should all stop working and stop investing. please send your dollars to me since you don't need them.

hahawe are not that special. this "global fucking pandemic" isn't ending the world any more than the Spanish Flu, the Great Depression, two world wars, etc. When you get fanatical about current events, any wise investing is out the window.

The point is, the pandemic is a blip in history when you really put it in perspective. Charlie and Warren are definitely thinking the same thing while looking for a crash and an epic deal of a lifetime. It's your choice what mindset you take.I don't think predicting the literal end of the world is similar to predicting an economic downturn. Downturns hurt, but the market either goes up over centuries, or every person who invests in the stock market is completely wrong and wasting their time. In the first case, a downturn isn't important. In the other case, this sub shouldn't exist.Something that has also been said a million times before...I was basically yelling at people to be buying at the lows in March when this sub was too busy proclaiming the world was ending and got scolded for it.

"Just as permabears are standing on the sidelines missing out on growth permabulls are bragging about gains that will evaporate."

Gains are gains that can be taken. Missing gains entirely because you are a stubborn pessimist means you don't have the option of gains to take. Also, "GAINS ARE GONNA EVAPORATE!" What if they don't? What if they only do somewhat but not entirely?

Additionally, a good portion of this sub has been complaining about the rise in the market since March - *if you didn't buy in March, chances are you aren't buying the next decline, either.* This sub is a circle of bearishness - missing bottoms because people on here are so pessimistic that they are *certain* the market is going lower, complaining about the market all the way up the rebound and then be too negative to buy the decline before it rebounds again. It was that way in December of 2018, it was that way in March.Or you could just keep averaging into the market.  Over time the market is naturally bullish with scattered short term bear markets.  Sit back enjoy the show and collect 10%/year like the market has provided since the start.I mean, if you’re actively trading, you can make money in bull or bear market. 

Day traders didn’t just call it quits from 2008-2010.Sweden.

Wrong. Not a fan. Just think people who get super defensive over “Chinese virus” look as stupid as those supporters you’re talking about - especially if your knee jerk reaction is to call it the Trump virus. Thanks for the “cookie” and while you’re laughing I’ll say I *do* get a laugh out if people so incredibly sensitive that they assume something like “the virus is from China” means you’re a trump supporter. It is also kind of sad though

But this has nothing to do with investing. The only important question is, how far along are we in the vaccine trials?I mean, check Zillow. There are tons of cheap studios and 1 bedrooms. My girlfriend and I just signed a lease for an awesome, really big (for Manhattan) studio on the East Side 2 blocks from the UN for 1900. There are nice places for under 1700 further uptown, on the UES and UWS. And right now, everything is negotiable. The place we're moving to wanted 2050/month originally. I'm sure you could get a decent place for like 1600 in a good part of Manhattan. 

Outside rent, pretty much everything here is cheaper than elsewhere. Transportation maxes out at $127 a month for your metrocard, which is less than you'd probably spend on gas elsewhere. Food is the same or cheaper too, with groceries not usually costing the two of us more than $50 a week. Restaurants are a bit pricier than elsewhere, but are also significantly better, and you can't find a good dollar slice anywhere but here. Plus, you'd probably end up making more money than you did and have a way shorter commute. And you'll be in better shape from walking everywhere.Which was only  AfghanistanI'd say it's like meth, you'll feel fine while you're doing it.fr dudes comes off extremely out of touch lolVisa has a limit to how many sandwiches they will let you trade for till they turn off the tap.

If the bottom 50% can't pay the rent, we have a housing crisis that dwarfs 2008, and landlords start going bust.    Those landlords who are in the top 50% now can't pay their bills and cut back.   
  
The 20% GDP is just what they directly spend.   The money they spend being on-spent creates an echo throughout economy.   
  
Using the above logic, you would think if unemployment raises just 5%, it's not a big deal.   After all most companies are laying off their 5% least productive anyway.   
  
But we know that's the difference between a booming economy and a terrible recession.  
  
Too many flow on effects.Bezos getting sick would cause barely a blip on the running of Amazon.Youre literally talking out of your ass man. Bezos has been grooming either andrew jassy or jeff wilkes to be the next CEO after him. Jassy is the ceo of AWS and has been with amazon for 2 decades similarly Wilke is the ceo of Amazon’s Retail and has been with amazon for 2 decades as well. 

You literally could not be more wrong"idiotic" seems a bit harsh.   


My checking account makes 3.25% interest on up to $20k, so I park my emergency fund in my checking account. Maybe that isn't GREAT returns, and  maybe there is a small chance of it being stolen, but the risk seems worth the reward.WhyHardly think it's misleading? Is it not true?See I think you're confusing normal with okay

Yeah these statistics in context are pretty normal but they're not okay.It seems more sobering than feeling dramatic/misleading. An example of income inequality and a debt-fueled economy.I agree with /u/TranscendentEagle.

It's not misleading.  It's how things are.  I get what you're trying to say, that it's something of a tautology.

That's from 2015.  It's probably even more severe  now.I wan't making an argument. Just pointing out that my experience does not match what you report as theirs.

It's clear to me that this pandemic has not created an economic crisis on the level of 2008 because the people effected affect the economy the least.If they end, assuming it passes right away, how long would it take Americans to get their benefits reinstated?  If it passes right away, it shouldn't take longer than a week? They still have everyone's information, so it should be more streamlined now.We could collectively decide to drive no more than 35 mph on every street and instantly eliminate tens of thousands of deaths every single year. Why don’t we? You see, the concept of cost-benefit analysis is lost on people like you. I’ve decided that there is greater risk in taking a vaccine which has been rushed through the approval process than actually contracting COVID. So again, agree to disagree.> I'm surprised to hear this from someone who is actually in the industry.

I seriously doubt this person is in the industry after reading their responses in this thread.I'm a physician. I agree with you.All the evidence so far points to a solid vaccine. It is an IF, but it's seeming likely they will work. 

My hunch is that things are going to be so bad this fall they will find a way to administer these things before the new year.  But I have zero evidence to saupport that, other then knowing the "one-day sooner" concept is being taken seriously and may get approved. That's where they deliberately infect vaccinated volunteers with covid to confirm the vaccine works. It could shave some time off the trials. Currently those sorts of tests are considered unethical, but with a pandemic raging, one could argue it's unethical not to test this way with willing participants.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/volunteers-step-up-to-be-patients-in-tests-for-covid-19-vaccine/2395649/%3fampSo, coming back later to see how well it aged is the only way to do it.It's kind of amazing that the mainstream narrative seems to be that the recession came and went, and it lasted a few weeks in March and early April.It appears to be similar with the housing market as well. It’s wild to me that people are making such large purchases when the job market is so uncertain. I get that wealthier people are less affected, but as we move through the year I expect more and more white collar positions to be eliminated. Maybe the auto and home market with finally decline this fall?It's like everyone magically added $1200 to their asking prices.Yes. Everything is being propped up when it would have otherwise failed.An important thing to note is that all the money being printed will not necessarily contribute to inflation because it isn't being spent, and therefore people aren't bidding up the prices of goodsFrom an economic standpoint, deflation is a much more likely outcome than inflation. Deflation is also a harder problem to solve.  The link below is a little detailed, but it goes into the reasoning why inflation isn't a major concern here.  

https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/29/federal-reserve-global-economy-coronavirus-pandemic-inflation-terminal-deflation-is-coming/No real inflation increase has been measured yet. The Fed would invite some inflation, they have been struggling to hit their 2% target.Honestly I think it’s similar with the motorcycle market. I see plenty of them out now (granted it’s peak season), but it’s one of the few activities that inherently involves social distancing, combined with the fact that it’s cheap enough for most people with some extra cash to get into. I’ve had my eye on a bike that typically sells for $5-6k for a year or two now, but asking prices are generally over $7k now.Just a comment not going at you or anything lolInteresting! Doesn’t look like there’s been any progress, but cool to see some high profile money people talking about crypto as the future.Yes, but they manufacture mostly everything for the world. The money is now flowing to China, not the US.Under your theory North Korea should be a superpower too. After all they have a strong military.OPEC can barely agree on anything and you think OPEC+ is going to come to an agreement?

Saudi Arabia and Russia are literally feuding as we speak.Hah - it's pathological for you! You can't separate the economy from the stock market in your own mind.

This fall/winter is going to be horrible. Huge unemployment. Lots of death. An economy in recession. That is going to happen. Whether the stock market will care is another story. Re-read my comment - I never made any predictions about the market.>doomsayers have missed out on massive gains 

What massive gains? I sold in late February when it was clear that COVID was going to have a major impact, and the S&P 500 is currently trading at roughly the same spot it was in February when I sold.  If I had held throughout the period, I'd be at the same spot I'm at now aside from stuff like dividends.  To have experienced massive gains, you had to have little to no market exposure in February and March, but a ton of market exposure thereafter.  

Basically, you're counting your gains but ignoring your losses.FWIW, if you’re looking at a politician as your metric to determine if you’re bullish or bearish, you’re just a bad investor.What point are you trying to make? Those events didn't end the world, but they had enormous economic impacts lasting for years.  I'm confident that the sun will still rise on January 1, 2021, but I'm not confident that our economy will be as healthy as it was on January 1, 2020.You literally cited examples that wrecked the economy but are incapable of grasping that we have yet to see the full negative impact during the current global pandemic.Yeah. But rarely when we are facing a massive recession with the market at ATHs. There are always people that think the bubble will never burst or does not even exist[deleted]> This sub is a circle of bearishness - missing bottoms because people on here are so pessimistic that they are certain the market is going lower, complaining about the market all the way up the rebound and then be too negative to buy the decline before it rebounds again. It was that way in December of 2018, it was that way in March.

I guess on the plus side, they never spend/invest any actual money.a) i highly appreciate your contributions to this sub.  you are clearly a top 3 poster and potentially the top dog

b) not to be accusatory and ungrateful, but this feels like revisionist history.  your style is much more "here are my thoughts and a few quotes, you decide for yourself".  unfortunately i decided in march to wait and regret waiting haha, but my point is sheep on here like me need people to explicitly tell them what to do and to actually yell at them to buy at the depths (similar to your negative positions on USO, mREITs and airlines) - i don't remember that happening.  apologies if it didOn a CAPE basis the market was never below average valuations, even in March. There are plenty who will buy back in if it becomes cheaper than it was then and plenty of reasons to think that those who bought in March will see poor returns if they hold long term.The long run returns on the S&P500 are just 6%.Traders who know how to play both ways make waayyy more money during crashes too. The only ones who get blown up are the people mindlessly buying the dip every timeyeah I'm aware of that, I'm a new investor but I ain't trying to predict the market but the pandemy. I'm certain that it will get much worse in winter so I'll just follow my gut. After that, I put everything in different indexes geographically separated and I call it a day.

For now though, I'll trust my guts because it has been right so far. And yes it's probably biased but I prefer not taking the risk than to miss on gains.

Also the first time I invested was in bitcoin in 2017, and what I noticed was everyone talking about it, people who didn't invest before, etc. I'm seeing the same pattern now, so I'm taking a step back. On the plus side I invested at the bottom and sold at the top so I'm fine for now.I've been in the market until very recently so don't mind locking in those gains. But hey, it's your money.Alright, I had to go creep your posts so I could see a picture of it. That's awesome dude. I'm envious, not gonna lienever said i was nychey, thats a good idea, maybe thatll workha, ive been on the streets 4 times. Trust me, you get tired of eating out of garbage cans. Living off the land is ILLEGAL in the USA. As its not your land, but the governments. You can hide for a while, until wildlife and game come and take your tent down, and arrest you for illegal land squatting.If that motel costs more than you make at 3 jobs, yeah. 400 bucks a week gets expensive fast.There's a good probably he gets paid to reddit. There's a lot of people who honestly do. More than you would think.So like, you do understand the whole "DAE THE MARKETS ONLY UP BECAUSE OF JPOW" is a meme and not a thing, right?Again, real world. Try as you might, you don't live in a vacuum. Doesn't matter if you actually support Trump or not, if you call it the China virus, you're on that side. It's the same as wearing a mask or not. Shouldn't be political, but it is. Wearing a mask = Democrat. Against masks = Republican.

Doesn't matter how it happened. That's the world we live in now, kid. And make no mistake, not recognizing these basic facets of our current society makes you a kid, through and through.

Seriously, go anywhere and call it the China virus. See what people think of you. In their minds, you instantly become a Trump supporter. Doesn't matter one lick whether you actually are or aren't. If that's what society labels you as, that's what you are. It's the same concept as "history is written by the winners." Doesn't matter what actually happened 200 years ago. The winners wrote it, and that's what we know now, and that's what we believe. I'm telling you this for your own benefit. Wake up.That is wild, thank you for the info!! I would never have thought it was that affordable. We pay more than that in a state that you would never believe.It does actually, I re-read it when you commented lol. OopsThat's a fair counterpoint.Sounds that way. I just know I've been contacted about an AWS position before and the salary seemed great (definitely high for the location this was in), but I've heard enough horror stories on the overworking that I turned the recruiter away. Didn't even think to look beyond the salary figure to see if it was really good compensation or not.So if someone stole your debit card, bye bye $20k?what company do you use? you can pm me directly if you dont want to give that info out to the public. I wont say a word :-)I would have $20k in savings and $5k I’m checking. Seems reversed. Unless it was a typo.Well using his information, every single member of the top 80% also own more than the entire bottom 20%.  It's not wrong, but it can paint a picture that is easily construed into more radical ideas.

Statistics are easy to warp to fit a narrative while still being true at face value.Why do you think they're not okay? What would be the alternative?It is misleading because it conjures an incorrect image. When people imagine the collective wealth of more than 20% of America for example, they aren't thinking 1 dollar. It relies on the ignorance of the audience to put the data into perspective.I'll ask again. If your tenants did not pay rent starting august 1, would that be an economically significant occurrence for you? or is that loss of income to you significant?Seeing as how everyone that's entitled to a benefit has not received a benefit, it might not be that simple even though it *should* be that simple.

My best friend was laid off in March and has not yet received his stimulus nor unemployment. Thankfully he has some savings to live off ofI would be curious to hear your rationale and evidence that led to your decision that contracting COVID is less risky than getting vaccinated, both from a personal standpoint and a public health standpoint.

And what evidence would you need to convince you that a vaccine is less risky, or that contracting COVID is more risky?But why is an mRNA vaccine more dangerous? As far as i know there is no scientific basis to this claim...Agreed my body my choice.No. You just said why.By the definition of recession, that's impossible.This is way true. The recession is far from over. There were a lot of weak employers that have been removed from the market and those jobs are going to take a long time to recover.

That said, the economy has been on the shitter though due to \~25-45 years of "trickle down" republican economic policy. There is a good chance that if we get a reverse of that idiotic economic policy, we could see 5-10% growth for 5 years. 

The thing that causes the most economic activity is to get cash into consumer's hands. Right now, \~50% of consumers are more or less broke (make less than \~50k a year). If you increase the wage of half of those consumers (say 50% of the workforce getting an extra 25k per year), That would cost roughly 2-3 trillion dollars but would probably result in 5-10 trillion in new economic activity mostly in the form of GDP.

I'm hopeful that a Biden presidency with a Senate and House could really inject the economy with some serious steroids. That is if they don't fuck up....I think this depends very much on your local market conditions. Much like 2008, my area was hardly impacted.Job market uncertainty depends on the field.  I'm pretty confident that I'll be able to keep my job during the crisis.  We've transitioned our offices into 100% WFH positions, with the expectation that we won't enter the office in person again until 2021 at the earliest, with the potential that we'll adopt WFH permanently going forward.  I currently live just outside NYC.  Like a ton of people in the NYC area, I don't own a car, and I rent my apartment.  A huge number of people are in a similar spot, many of whom plan to leave the city to lower cost of living.  These people would be adding to the demand for cars/houses, and because supply is squeezed right now with low inventory, we see increases in price.  People are taking a wait-and-see approach for now, hence the low supply.  Going forward, that could change.I'm waiting for a crash, honestly. I hope it doesn't happen, but as the expression goes: "plan for the worst, hope for the best."

I'm not sure how well I'm planning, though. \*sigh*But.... but Andrew Wang said that couldn't happen.This comment chain started with housing and cars having their prices being increased, though. More supply shortages are coming, too (at the same time that some supply shortages are being alleviated).

There's a storm slowly brewing with China as well, which could end up causing some severe supply disruption.

Lots of uncertainty. And stagnation is worse than inflation, too.I think once the global currencies start to weaken, the imf will step in to stabilize world economy by issuing e-coins backed by a mix of currenciesAnd who buys all that shit they produce? The US is about half of global gdp. Not to mention the manufacturing will probably shift to even cheaper countries as China becomes more and more expensive.What are you talking about? I’m not talking about military strength in talking about the USD ties to oil. And I should say OPEC+ because Russia isn’t actually involved in the original OPEC, but at this point that still doesn’t change my argument.Do you understand why they’re feuding? It’s about money and what is the best approach to make more money.

If they see the dollar becoming unstable and could potentially risk their bottom line they will absolutely agree to move away from it.You don't seem to understand that I'm exclusively addressing the comments about the stock market.So that's your plan? sell high and buy when? if you didn't buy when it dipped it's because you were (and still are apparently) waiting for it to drop even further.

So you're one of those doomsayers I'm talking about and if never goes that low again, you will have missed out on massive gains, which was exactly my point.Peter Schiff is not a politician.[deleted]it always comes back.The market is within 10% of ATHs something like 90% of the time. "we are facing a massive recession". you need to stop with these phrases. Economists have predicted 27 of the last 3 recessions.Bubbles happen, and they burst, but markets either rise in the long run or we are all going to be broke because the world economy is going to collapse "forever" (unlikely). In the first scenario, just hold onto your britches. In the second scenario, well... who cares? We have bigger problems.Another mod whose name I can't remember even called dvdmovie1 out for yelling his bullish views at people in April and he took a break from posting. The mod deleted his post after realizing dvdmovie1 is also a mod lol.

I also stopped posting in March/April as any post that didn't say "we're going lower" was auto-downvoted. Honestly, not much has changed 30-40% later.It's crazy how much money a stranger on the internet, /u/dvdmovie1, has helped me make as well. Thanks again for the quality posts.Thats the thing, in March no one had any idea what the fuck was going on! If you had cash to spare and you wanted to gamble you bought. But even among people who bought I can guarantee you almost everyone wishes they were more aggressive. And that speaks to the uncertainty that was there. And most people just did nothing, because that’s a very reasonable thing to do when you have incomplete information.>plenty of reasons to think that those who bought in March will see poor returns if they hold long term.

Lol. I guess investing isn't for you then.If you adjust for inflation it drops down to 7% from 9.8%.  Either way it's bullish because it's a positive number.Why not just put more of your money in safe assets? Then, you can hedge your bets instead of going all or nothing.

You could go 30% VT AND 70% BND then, when you feel ready, you can increase your equity allocation.

You could just have a lower risk tolerance than being 100% equities which is ok. Just add more bonds to your portfolio until you're in a place where you feel comfortable.lol no problem and thank you!!   They are shockingly affordable if you really want one.   Gets more looks than a Ferrari too if that's your thing.such a 2020 thing. the community message board full of paid shillsJesus christ dude. How.. from the post i just sent you..Do you think my financial outlook involves memes. Keep talking.. you are sounding even dumber than I originally gave you credit for. It was a jib at you because your unlimited confidence in what seems to be a worsening situation. Wallstreet is disconnected from the work force.. People make wall street money.. not the other way around.. and when we go back into lock down after missing the mark the first time around.. Youll see that human capital is worth more than your robinhood account. message me in 4 from your beach house. Who cares how much money you make.. youre a shitty fucking human... and I never say that.And you can sell your car! That said, since you said "we" I'm assuming you have multiple people. You're never going to find a 2 bedroom that cheap, and even 1 bedrooms in Manhattan for under $2000 basically don't exist. If it's just you and one other person, you'd be fine in a big studio though. And peeping your comment history, you could afford up to $2500, which may be able to find you a cheaper Manhattan 2 bed.1. They would need the PIN.

2. You aren't liable if someone steals your debit card if you report it within 60 days.

3. You can use a debit card to withdraw from savings, too.It’s a smaller local credit union. Another one in the area is 3% up to $15k, which makes me think these types of accounts are fairly common.No not a typo. I don't know why I'd switch it. The interest rate at my bank in my savings account is like .1%.The fact that 20% of the richest country in the world have zero net worth seems problematic, no?Oh, I didn't realize you cared.

It would not impact me in a significant way. In no way would it change my life.Fair enough, I've seen some places have backlogs for unemployment, not sure why they didn't hire more people to help process all the claims?

  Here in Canada there was a program called CERB, anyone who was affected by COVID employment wise could apply and get $2000 directly deposited to your bank, a lot of people got double payments for some reason.  It was obviously abused, and the CRA is going be like bloodhounds trying to get the funds back. However, the instant support was seriously helpful for a lot of people. Again it was abused, and they'll be looking into it, but the uncertainty at the time when CERB became active was so high.An mRNA is theoretically safer, and Moderna's Phase I data look pretty tolerable in terms of safety, but the concern is that Moderna is a new company and mRNA is an unproven new technology.Not sure we're reading the same conversation. You have a good day there.What are your thoughts on Build Back Better? IMO seems to be a good solution to jack up economy and simultaneously tackle ccGood luck getting taxes raised to actually pay for it thoughThat’s a good point. My hometown is a couple hours north of NYC so it’s been saturated with weekenders for a while now, however property values are really beginning to accelerate as people permanently move there from the city. 

My job is similar in that it’s WFH now through at least 2021 with the potential to become permanent. I am not confident in my job however (Aerospace industry), and I have a feeling that with the exception of certain industries many people will be losing their jobs moving forward as demand and government stimulus is reduced.Opportunistic gouging rather than actual inflation.

One is anecdotal, the other is measured and weighted.Not sure why you're being downvoted. Butthurt "Wang gang" bros here in r/investing? lolChinas debt isn't too large of a problem just yet for basically 2 reasons

1. it's corporate and consumer debt, if shit goes south the gov can still borrorw to make things less bad

2. chines people have an insane savings rate. It means the gov didn't have to pay out large unemployment fhecks. It also represents a huge potential source of capitalOil is worth less than clean water these days. Exxon Mobil chevron etc are dying. In 10 years oil will be a small insignificant industry. The petrodollar is meaningless now. It’s not 2008 anymoreOil producing nations use the Petro-Dollar in exchange for the US Navy enforcing clear shipping lanes and providing the Saudis with enormous influence and weapons. Remember Saudi Arabia was the ones who first agreed to make the Petro-dollar a thing. 

https://www.worldometers.info/oil/oil-production-by-country/

The has massive influence over itself (obviously), Canada, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, UAE, Brazil, Mexico and Kuwait.

There is also the well known fact that threatening to go away form the Petro-dollar does not normally go well for the countries involved. Iran, Iraq, Venezuela, Libya, Syria. 

It's not impossible, but thinking it is in anyway likely is foolish.Okay then here's my prediction: who the hell knows? 🤷‍♂️ Anyone trying to predict where the market will go right now is an idiot.>So that's your plan? sell high and buy when? if you didn't buy when it dipped it's because you were (and still are apparently) waiting for it to drop even further.

Me personally? Sell high and gradually buy back into the market, especially after the election.  I went from 85% stock at the start of the year to 40% stock in late February, and I've gradually increased that to 50% stock now.  I'm generally a buy-and-hold investor, but it was clear in mid-February that this would be a major event.  I recognize that I'll forego  potential gains in 2020 on my cash position, but I'm okay with that as a risk mitigation strategy. 

I dispute the idea of massive gains though.  I'm ignoring things like dividends to make the point, but if I had $100 invested in an S&P 500 fund at the start of 2020, I would have had $69 in late March and $98 today.  You're looking at the rise from $69 to $98 and seeing massive gains, but that's not a fair comparison because only the doomsayers would have been all-cash in late March.  Bullish investors like yourself would have been invested in the market at the start of the year, so their total experience YTD is a 2% *loss*, not massive gains.

>So you're one of those doomsayers I'm talking about and if never goes that low again, you will have missed out on massive gains, which was exactly my point.

Disagree with you here too.  My 401(k) is on autopilot, so I buy into the market every two weeks with the same amount regardless of market conditions.  I've been doing that for more than a decade now.  I also dumped a little extra into the markets in March and April when things were really bad, so I did get massive gains on that money.  However, I can't ignore the massive losses on the 40% stocks that I held through March.  YTD, I'm roughly flat.LOL I thought it said Adam Schiff 😂 my faultFunny you bring up being "fanatical" about world events yet your comment is riddled with fanaticism of never-ending "American prosperity".

Sure, I would love it that way but we gotta be aware of the various shortcomings if we want to preserve it.Yeah but the conversation is when is the optimal time to invest. You can make that argument with anything related to the economy. Why even talk about it then?Every respectable forecast is predicting a massive contraction in growth in 2020. On a completely different scale to anything we have seen for a while. Asking me to 'stop with these phrases' is just sticking your fingers in your ears>Economists have predicted 27 of the last 3 recessions.

And so have a much better track record than this sub?True. But saying the market will be up eventually is no better than saying the market will go down at some point. None of us have a clue about the exact timing yet the bulls expect the bears to be able to call it with precision or they're 'wrong'Or I am a value investor aware of how poor annualised returns are if you buy overvalued assets.Not that I'm in the market for one right now, but what's a rough cost estimate for one?DAE THINK THE MARKETS WILL CRASH: after Q1 earnings, after Q2 earnings, after March/April/May/June unemployment are released, after PPP ends?You dont need a pin for online purchases. But number 2 is the real answerWhat’s the interest in your checking? You should switch savings accounts then.Sure. Are you suggesting that richest and poorest should all somehow have the same amount of wealth?I think the response to your question is super long as it predates COVID, stemming from systematic inefficient bureaus of government. Add on significantly less tax revenue governments are receiving, and local govts eventually can’t hire more people without getting backlash from its citizens for more deficit spending than usual. 

Its wild that something so simple can be so tangled and difficult to solve because the inherent issues in our society are exacerbatedAgreedTake it directly from the new deal. That's exactly what FDR did and I think Biden is trying to do the same. If Trump is reelected, or if the Senate doesn't go Democrat, we'll get a shitty economy (but the stock market might do well).Giving people free money means that the entire s/d curve gets shifted up by the amount of free money.On reddit, mocking the approved narrative is frowned upon, and censored if possible.The petrodollar is not meaningless what an ignorant thing to say.

Just because the US shale industry is dying doesn’t mean that oil isn’t an incredibly important asset when it comes to international affairs.Except now if we invade a country to protect the dollar Russia, China, North Korea, Iran would all take the opportunity to fight the US, essentially causing another world war.

Either way you look at it not good for the economy.Thank you, glad we agree.exactly, we shouldn't be trying to time the market or predict crashes. Invest now, DCA, your choice. When a big crash happens, if you have the cash, invest at that moment (when your portfolio is solid red). Otherwise, we should all stop pretending to be fortune tellers.I'm invested for the next 50 years, so idc what happens in the short term. Go ahead and try and time the market.the market doesn't have to be up eventually; it is up now. It depends on your entry point but look at the entire history of the market and it's up, and it's beaten inflation. past performance is no guarantee; but what is? Why do we do this in the first place? Get some dividends; that's the best bet.Tell me one legitimate reason you would invest now if you thought we were going lower than March lows long-term?A roadster like mine would be around $20-25k.  30k for show quality.   You could also get a tudor or sedan for much cheaper $15k for a decent one.Bingo. Fair Credit Billing Act. You are technically liable for up to $50 I believe, but I've had it for 10 years, earned around $5k in interest and haven't had a problem yet, so I sleep soundly at night.   


(did misplace the card once and immediately called the bank.... this stuff does happen)No, I'm not saying that at all. If youre going to attempt a strawman, at least base it on something I said.There's only one thing to imply: 20% of the population should not have zero net worth.

Even then, it's actually like 60% of the population owns 0-3% of the US's net wealth.

We could take this table:

Percent US Population | Percent US Net Worth
---|---
1% | 35%
4% | 28%
5% | 14%
10% | 12%
20% | 9%
20% | 3%
40% | 0%

... and make it look like this:

Percent US Population | Percent US Net Worth
---|---
1% | 30%
4% | 23%
5% | 16%
40% | 17%
50% | 14%


If we took 10% of the wealth away from the top 5% wealthiest people in the country and redistributed such that the bottom 95% of the population had a total 47%, the top 1% could still own 30% of the total net wealth of the United States, the top 5% would still own 53% of the net wealth of the country.

It goes from 80% of the country sharing a combined 12% of the wealth, to 90% of the country sharing 31% of the wealth.

The super rich get to stay rich, but at least 9/10s of the country would have _something_.I didn't downvote you, but d remained constant since loss of income borked that half of the curve. We won't actually know until CPI-U and PCE reports come out.In 20 years oil will decline as solar, wind, geothermal and all the other alternative energies clobber it.> Russia, China, North Korea, Iran would all take the opportunity to fight the US, essentially causing another world war.

Lol. Do you honestly believe this? Iran wouldn't even do anything when we killed their top general. China and Russia declaring war on the US is so outside of the realm of possibility, it's as useful as talking about Aliens coming down and replacing the US dollar with the Space-dollar.

Are you forgetting that Russia has literally annexed territory from it's European neighbors and the American and EU response was essentially wagging their finger? And yet you think the massively weaker Russians are going to fight the US. Seriously dude. Get a grip.No one is pretending to be a fortune teller but you don’t need to be one when the writing is in bright red on the wall. Look at the charts from the crash from 08 & the one in the 80’s. They’re identical. That’s the point you’re not understanding. The economy is overstretched right now.

Edit:

Imagine walking into a room full of financial analysts & blurting “ ha ha yeah, but it’ll come back. It always does.” You’ll get laughed at right out of the building. That’s not the point of what we’re saying.I'm actually half-in half-out so I'm fairly ambivalent on what happensYou wouldn't. But who thinks that?Oh wow, that is way less expensive than I would have thoughtIm honestly upset I havent looked into credit unions. I use chase and wells fargo and havent had great experiences with wells fargo. Honestly I only haven’t canceled WF cause it has my oldest credit card and I want to keep my credit ageSorry I misread what you said as "is 20% of the richest having no networth not problematic?".

Regarding the 20% of people in the richest country not having a positive networth... I don't think that's necessarily problematic or preventable. I was in that demographic myself for many years as a student and in the beginning of my career. I then quickly climbed to the top 10% within a decade.

There will also be many people who will stay in that bracket for life due to personal choices which includes many of my colleagues that have the same income but spend like money is going out of style.The problem with that is that money will quickly find it's way back to the rich anyway. There is nothing you can do to make certain people have savings who would rather spend. Neither should we. That is their choice. Wealth redistribution is nothing but stealing and it already exists in the form of welfare and social programs and increasing tax brackets.Yeah people said this 20 years ago too. Id say we still have another 50-100 years of oil dominance unless there is some major breakthrough in how solar energy capture works.China declaring war on the US is on the same level as aliens? Are you serious? You haven’t been paying attention if you actually think this.my point is that your point doesn't really matter. I'm investing for the long term. I'm not trying to market time, swing trade, or whatever other bullshit. If the market takes a nose dive, I'm putting more money into stocks with strong fundamentals that look attractive to me. I'm not going to panic sell. I'll just be patient. That's called "investing."> plenty of reasons to think that those who bought in March will see poor returns if they hold long term.

-u/Khashoggis-Thumbs

Maybe what you mean to say is poor marginal returns from right now here today, because as someone who bought in March I assure you my returns are looking fine. If SE or SHOP or AYX get back down to anywhere near what they were in March/April, then I'll be buying them again.Right?  People think they are rare since you don't see many around but the truth is they cranked out over 5 million of them back in the day.   98% of the survivors are now owned by boomers and silent generation that are slowing dieing out... the cars have to go somewhere!Then tax at up to 99% then. Also much of the value of USD derived by the geopolitical position of the USA, which is funded by tax. Gut the US.gov and you will see this wealth implode.Huge response incoming!  If you don't want to engage, that's fine.  But I was in a thinking mood, so I just kinda kept writing.

**tl;dr: I think a minor redistribution of wealth can actually allow for the wealthiest to grow their wealth faster (obviously along with everyone else).  ** 

I think we're going to disagree on a philosophical level. That's okay, but I want to have an honest discussion and see where we can compromise on our ideals.  Welfare and social programs are necessary, unfortunately, from my perspective.  However I get where you're coming from.

I do believe in a perfect world that everyone truly could take care of themselves.  However, the world is not perfect, and humans are not perfect. I wish it were simpler, but it's not black and white.  It's a mess of greys.  I know you know this. We need to have systems in place so that those who fall down don't end up dragging others with them, so-to-speak.  The cost of welfare and social programs are part of a cost of living in a modern society.  Tax brackets that increase with your income represent, to me, a proportional return to your society for which it's provided to you in the form of a stable government, good infrastructure, and a well-educated, safe, and healthy populace that provides an environment where someone has the opportunity to obtain that much wealth, to have that income.  

Sometimes people do not choose to spend instead of save. Someone with a poor social support system may end up missing out on educational or vocational opportunities.  I think most people naturally become complacent and appreciate or need routine to remain stable, so someone might find themselves "spinning their wheels" in a low income position for a while due to life circumstances that were out of their control when they started there.

I really like the phrase "a rising tide lifts all boats", but I think for a different reason than typically intended.  The way I think of it isn't so much something like, everyone does better because the market does well "outside" of their actions (or the actions of a few), but moreso that the "collective" (please don't get hung up on this word) actions of a society as a _whole_ will cause the tide to rise because of something like (but not exactly) the law of comparative advantage, but on a smaller scale.  I think that the super wealthy would actually benefit more from the minor redistribution that we're talking about as their growth is still exponential but with another  translation "up" from giving a larger population more opportunity to engage in trade, production, and investment. I'm not an economist, I'm just thinking.  But it makes sense to me.

I do not agree that wealth redistribution is stealing, up to a certain point.  I do agree that it is our right to have and keep both personal and private property.  It creates incentive, and plus it's cool having my own stuff, lol.  But I also do believe that it's our "right" to have access to our hierarchy of needs.  This is a good article I just found while thinking, it's a short little read: [Right to Health Care. What Does that Mean?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3190840/)

At the end, the author states:

>[...] the right to health care can mean many different things. Providing health care rights requires infringement upon other rights, moral judgements, and a complex allocation of resources. Simple blanket statements like: “everyone has a right to health care” are meaningless. Arguing over such a statement is useless. 

I like this, and I agree with it. Replace "healthcare" with what I mean when I talk about wealth redistribution (via things like welfare, unemployment, additional social programs, even UBI, etc).  It's not so much a "right", because that's a somewhat empty term in this context when specifics aren't explained, but we should be individually _entitled_ (in what would be a legal sense if enacted) to our physiological and safety needs by the society in which we live via that wealth redistribution.  This is because when, for instance, the bottom 60% of the owners of net wealth of a nation, like in my previous example, are assured that their basic needs will be fulfilled, they're free to contribute to the generation of value in novel ways, increasing the number of avenues that the "comparative advantage"-like phenomenon can be fulfilled in that society.

Anyway.  Thanks for coming to my TEDx talk.How come the oil companies are dropping the soap? Let’s look at how old king coal is doing shall we? Peabody energy and arch coal have seen better days and Exxon Mobil/Saudi Aramco will join them ;).China declaring war on the US over an intervention in some oil producing third world country is absolutely on the same level as aliens. 

It's pretty clear you haven't done much reading on the Cold-War. Nuclear powers don't go into open war because of third worlders. Like I said in my last comment, get a grip.What’s the point of even commenting in this thread then? That’s why your opinion is stupid.Oil companies being down right now was NOTHING to do with renewable energy. I’m done arguing with someone who is so ill informed in this situation.They would declare war because we are threatening their economy daily. They would use the opportunity to strike while they can gather support. You’re the one who needs to get a grip lol.What I’m saying is oil is becoming like coal. Sure it will have niche industrial uses such as lubricants etc so it will fare better than coal but there’s a reason oil has never recovered since 2008.Lay off the Call of Duty. 

Your understanding of geopolitics is abysmal. Nuclear War over Nigeria. Seems legit.Says the guy who said war with China is less likely than aliens visiting earthWar with China over an oil producing third world nation is.

The much stronger US didn't go to war with Russia after they literally annexed a portion of a country that borders the EU and NATO. Yet you think the two much weaker nations of China and Russia are going to declare (nuclear) war on the US (and NATO) over country thousands of miles away. 

Lmao. Stick to Call of Duty.No I’m saying war will happen because of how we are threatening the Chinese economy and they will use any situation they can to gain an edge. 

Guarantee you’re under 20 years old the way you keep bringing up Call of Duty as an insult too lmao. I don’t play that game and i’m guessing you get a lot of your geopolitical genius from reddit, right?I get my knowledge of geopolitics from reading. You should try it. 

It's very obvious you view geopolitics like a video game. Open War is so absurdly unlikely between nuclear powers. 

You know what will destroy the Chinese Economy? Open War with NATO, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, plus tons of others. For a fucking country like Libya. Makes a lot of sense dude. 

Do better. It's embarrassing. I hope your investing isn't as bad as your opinions on geopolitics.Ah so you are under 20. I’m done arguing international politics with a college freshman.LOL.

The projection is strong with this one. Back to Call of Duty with you. 

I'm pretty confident you just realized how stupid your opinions are. Laughable.lmao I don’t play call of duty and just don’t feel like repeating myself. If you don’t see how likely war with China is then you’re either ignorant, an idiot, or both (I’m thinking it’s the last option)Go back to r/conspiracy and r/JoeRogan,

Suddenly the faux-intellectualism with near zero actual understanding makes a lot of sense. Making Joe proud. He got rich on it after all.LMAO and r/politics and r/neoliberal are much better. What a fucking idiotYes, neoliberal actually does understand geopolitics. Geopolitics is literally a core part of neoliberalism. 

r/politics does not. 

Good thing I mostly post on there to make fun of ignorant Bernie Bros.

After March 17 you were a fool for buying because it was a dead cat bounce. Then you were a fool for buying because it must just be a temporary Fed pump.

|-|-|-|-|remindme! 4 daysHuh?agreed 100%

I was really shocked that it dropped back to $35 this week after performing so well

I'm cool with it though, I bought in another few dozen shares because of itI'm surprised how under the radar it is going. I think it's hard to figure out how they can scale right now. They already serve DNS for a shit ton of big companies. I have been using it since 2015 and had no issues.

The free service is more than enough, but hopefully they release something that can grab those smaller users. It would be crazy if they can pull off a domain registrar / VPS service.So would you consider NET a long-term play? Why or why not? Curious to your thoughts.NET or Fastly?Looks like FSLY is falling a bit, but they were absolutely on fire in recent months.Yeah but they'll say that and my guess pair it with some numbers. 

It's going to be good for themlots of money has to have been invested in the new xbox launch too. from R&D to manufacturing to marketing

still, my account has been long on MSFT for 19 years (I did recently sell off some to dip my toe into NET and a few other companies though)There’s also the possibility of significant deferred revenue from concessions made with new companies coming on to the platform. Lots of variablesBuilding assets that won't be wasted is a good expense.I think this could be right. But who knows. 

If this is the case, ANET will destroy their earnings expectations most likely> MSFT will have spent a good chunk of change on cloud infrastructure upgrades

Literally changing int values in kubernetes configs, very expensiveyou mean you are [jacked to the tits](https://youtu.be/Quf0q3ABb7I?t=34)?Other than NFLX and MSFT both being "tech", they have little - if anything - in common.Netflix is rome with the barbarians (DIS, Hulu, Apple, NBC) etc at the gate. Still a good company, but their monopoly on being the "basic default" streaming service everyone has is at an end. 

MSFT is not anywhere close to being in a similar situation.This is how you know someone’s new to investing lolI don’t follow.What kind of drugs you smoking? Send some our way pleasehow the fuck does netflix have anything to do with msft... What? Why?Hmm you’re from the future then?Don't forget VTIAX and VBTLX, don't want to take on *too* much risk!The former. But you can also buy VTI until you hit 3k!3k to get started, and I don’t think there’s a minimum purchase after that.It’s 3k upfront. After that you can put a penny in of you wantbecause investing in a total stock market fund is investingIt’s not all I buy, it’s just the thing I buy each paydayyou have opened my third eye!They just dont understand that waiting for the shares to go down like they did in march just wont workYou mean 3400.YesWe'll see. I honestly didn't expect quantitative easing and Fed to have such a direct impact. I had never seen it at work at this scale. Volatility has been much higher than usual so I do expect oscillations of this magnitude to happen more frequently in this current market. Idk fellas, we'll see what happens. All we can do is plan accordingly. And even if not a "meaningful" dip, meaningful is different for different people. Even if I can get a 10-20% discount z thats extremely meaningful over another 20 yr timeline for me. Good luck y'all!Plus they have been too cowardly to buy any dip this far, there is no way they will buy one in near future>Unless people are over leveraged (like they were back in 2008-2009), any dip will be immediately bought up.

Bingo! I've been downvoted before but I've mentioned exactly this. Not to mention people can easily react with stock apps on their phones, I doubt we'll ever see as big a dip as 08 again.All in VAG!If they are worse than expected.So when this sub finally starts saying buy buy buy, dump everything. LolYour comment perfectly describes this and other subs. The classic broken clock approach.The stock market is a bunch of skittish people trying to predict the future. No one really knows what’s going on. A few people have some good ideas, but no one really knows.You're right. Like I mentioned, it seemed like a once in a lifetime thing for me. But, seeing the same trend (in USA only) not worldwide, I do foresee a dip, especially in this inflated market. I don't anticipate a dip of the degree as March, but are we not correct to speculate in a correction at at least 25% for a day? 

Initially you saw a huge shift in worldwide capital into the stock market which inflated prices. I don't see that happening again seeing our current situation. Anyway, it's all speculation in the end. Good luck all!Which is EXACTLY why there's not going to be a dip :-)If a Reddit comment section generally sees it as likely, it is priced in and no meaningful movement will happen.You're about 3 months too late budTold ya :-)We should see a lot of missed price earnings compounded by rising COVID19 infections. I'm not sure how likely we'll see such a big drop line before, but still keeping a keen eye on fluctuations and hopefully I don't miss out on what looked to be like a once in a lifetime opportunity to shave off a decade from early retirementNot now, Priced-In Bot.

But he's wrong. Just sell the bad, overvalued ones. Like TSLA.they had an outage.Same. Going to grab a bit more on Monday too.Cloud in general had a pullback week. As much as I like NET the whole sector had been pumping HARD nonstop for a while, and has crushed ATH's, it's normal that ahead of earnings week people start thinking hey did all of this get pumped way above what it's worth? And take some profits.

I sure as hell wish I sold my FSLY shares at 100+ haha. Still got out at 86 and bought back in at 79, bringing my avg cost down to 65. And I DCA'd on NET as well. 

Hopefully they both crush earnings. Expectations are really high though so we could see a dip.[removed]I think the default position of most companies is going to be "let's deploy to Azure and use Font Door" or "let's deploy to AWS and use Cloudfront". I think the success of Cloudlare is threatened by these "native" cloud options. In most cases, Azure/AWS only have to build something 75% as good as Cloudflare to siphon off a significant number of their customers. Not sure what that means long-term for NET but I wouldn't bet the farm on them.AkamaiXbox to Microsoft is like cameras to Canon. It's like 1/1000 of their business.Let me school you a bit. When a stock disappoints with earnings, especially during a pandemic when many thought it should have killed it, it can affect other stocks and opens your eyes to the fact that earnings you think might be great may NOT actually be the case because of the pandemic.I guess you are. Study up.They both stream videos duh.

I don’t follow Microsoft at all, but if anything their 365 base will go up because of people switching to Teams. 

But again, no clue. Comparing Netflix to Microsoft doesn’t make sense in my mind,They were a tech play expected to crush earnings but didn’t. We will see if Microsoft follows or beats.Well a pandemic to start. Kind of obviousPump the brakes, psychoPussy[deleted]First one, then the other.They'll be ready for SPY280 when SPY is at 400.

Last dip I bought was at 300. I dont expect we will see that ever again minus something catastrophic rocking the market.

Edit: Cash gang getting mad about getting called out on their bullshit as usual lol. Keep downvoting and wiping your tears with you piles of useless cash while everyone makes out like bandits and you keep on waiting. Any day now Im sure guys.If it goes up then everything about finance and economics will go down the drain. I kid but it goes up then the market is operating in a massive bubble.Who knows what will happen, but I think the odds of a 10-20% pullback are very low.I have a 1 month time line. I want a do over of March 23rd! And a do over of the V shaped recovery! But now it'll be W shaped recovery! Whooooooo!

Maybe the deferred payments and 30% plus mortgage defaults and maybe some racial tensions before election plus a second lockdown can make it all happen? Throw in a wild card from somewhere. Anything is possible!

I'm not happy with my 178% from Tesla.

I will never be happy. 

Happiness was never the goal!

Just excitement! Like July 22 for Tesla earnings has had me rock hard for 2 weeks now!

By the time it reached the mainstream news, it’s too late to get in.Yeah, sometimes it feels that way. To validate your point, sometimes, take the notion of this virus for example, I feel that I'm quarantined and taking it seriously while I see countless footage of people going outside in masses. I think I'm in the right, but you have a valid point. I'm probably that weirdo that wears masks and gloves and has stayed inside over something that probably isn't that threatening if so many people are so nonchalant about it. Maybe I am that person that overthinks when i should just enter the market at current prices.

This next gen console launch is going to show everyone MSFT is the king of gaming. Period. You don't even need an xbox to play xbox games, I can play half on them on my pc. I'm not even buying the next xbox bc I have a fast pc, 'play anywhere' games are becoming standardized by msft, and crossplay and discord lets me play with everyone. Xcloud are game streaming are making the console you own irrelevant as long as you have a device with a screen and internet. Game pass ultimate gives an expansive library to console and pc users. Plus all the gaming software they have integrated on pc is actually impressive and I had no idea any of it existed until I built a pc a few months ago.

It's hard to find real world example of IOT things that are happening commercially, but MSFT is doing it with gaming, and no one else is even close. As their technology matures everyone's gonna look back 5 years and be like fuck how did I not see this coming. And its not just going to be gaming, msft is going to have all the infrastructure in place to dominate the home entertainment industry in the next decade.Yeah I don’t see why Netflix’s performance has any impact on Microsoft.imagine thinking "tech" is an industryIt is. Just might be 2021 before it happensTIL Cash is useless 😂you mean like a poorly managed pandemic raging worse than ever leading to deleterious economic outcomes?RemindMe! One yearWhat do you think the past few months have been? lolIt goes cause thats what investors value the market. Earnings only show direction, yet everything got killed on the capitulation drop at the start and we havnt seen lows that low. Everyone is like well it hit there and people are unemployed it must go down, yet investors dont value that. They value opportunity right now of the recoveryI think it will highly depend on the next stimulus. If consumer spending doesn't at least stay at current levels due to unemployment benefits being curtailed then you could still see a dip that ripples through the market in many sectors. I think we will see before September if there is any meaningful dip again.I'm even seeing ads in the UK now from stock brokers encouraging people to trade.  I've never seen this before, it's possible I may have missed it before, but the ads are certainly very frequent now.I get caution. To validate your point, someone will be right about a dip or crash eventually. Trading is a hobby for me, but as a business owner I only think about “acceptable risk”. Bull cases or bear cases all can make sense. I’m comfortable with the amount of exposure I have, and don’t give much thought to doom and gloom. Someday someone will be right. I’m ok with that. In the meantime I buy dips and hold on for dear life. Haha.If that was true there would be no market to trade in now would there? We trade on sigma. Therefore there has to be surprises.Shrödinger’s Stock: It’s earning’s are priced-in and not priced-in until you purchase it.Don’t think so, new gen consoles won’t release till November, desktop CPUs won’t release (rumored) in September and I believe only a select few of their APU chips in laptops released along with their refresh desktop chips (released July 7th).Dont buy it until it actually hits at least 59.00. Its bee going up and down between 50-56 for months. Unless youre long on it then its a good buy either wayNot sure on value but AMD is making the GPU and CPU for the consoles. They are generally the most expensive parts for computers so I don't know why it would be any different in a console.Voluminous if veraciousIf they can show a profit I think so too.From what I heard it was a malfunctioning or misconfigured core router, not usage.I guess I should have clarified. My position is that they aren't a compelling long-term investment to me because they don't have a moat. They also aren't compelling because I think they have to overcome the "default" solutions for cloud vendors like AWS/Azure. Right now, I would absolutely say that Cloudflare is the default CDN provider if you need a CDN. Maybe that will continue and maybe it won't. I'm just not convinced enough to bet a significant amount of money on it. In the worst possible scenario, I invest my money and then AWS/Azure/GCP/etc. declare massive free tiers to their own CDN solutions in order to get people on their platform and profit off of them with other services.CannonsI think they make like 99% of revenue on business copiers. Don't quote me on the numbers, but I'm a photographer and was amazed to read this article saying how their camera dept is basically a pet project compared their copier/printer business.PrintersBiblesCanon Inc. (キヤノンキャノン株式会社, Kyanon kabushiki gaisha) is a Japanese multinational corporation specializing in the manufacture of imaging and optical products, including cameras, camcorders, professional displays, TV broadcasting and film equipment, projectors, photocopiers, photolitographyequipment (steppers, scanners), computer printers, image scanners, binoculars, microscopes, medical equipment (including Computer Tomography diagnostic systems, MRI and diagnostic ultrasound systems), LCDand OLED panel manufacturing equipment, CCTV solutions, imagining sensors, calculators, high precision positioning and measurement devices (such as rotary encoders), and custom optical components (including lenses) for third party companies.

(From Wikipedia)Dude, like 99% of businesses are already in the MSFT ecosystem, which is where the money is, not teens gaming. 

Ya it's cool if your into gaming, but would be suppressed if it made of more then 1/20th of their revenue.Go spread your negativity somewhere else.[deleted]It is when you have no need for it and the market has yielded people nice little 100% returns in the last 3 months depending on what assets you played around in. 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️[removed]How can you even point at COVID lockdown as a threat at this point? That shit has been going on for almost 2 quarters now.

COVID is absolutly priced in right now. The known isn't what affects the market, its the unknown. Enron, Bear Stearns, 9/11, inital COVID panic...that moves the market.

See ya in a year brother. 🤙🤙I think it's going to take longer than that (I'm thinking after the election) and assuming it does occur, will probably be more of a waterfall that's in a drought than a waterfall after a major rainstorm (like late Feb/early March).

(like fastly) =)well fuck...And what do people do while waiting at the copier? Of course they enjoy a refreshing Coke! KO 🚀🚀are more printers going to be sold due to increased work at home or less? Can't see employees requiring that at home when offices could just make it all digital, as most of us have doneThey absolutely have a tremendous presence in business, so why would you bother trying to expand market share in that area, when you can get young people into the XBOX ecosystem, and hopefully make them more likely to buy PCs and MSFT phones? They’re trying to take business away from Apple, not other companies that cater to business needs.

Also, young people who are more familiar with MSFT software are also more comfortable with it when they enter the professional world, so businesses don’t need to worry about lag while people get acclimated to Mac or something. It all feeds into itself, it’s pretty basic marketing.no you are dumb and you need to be aware of itRemindMe! 6 monthsTwenty dollars can buy many peanuts.Your submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

But I'll humor you...

The March wave of COVID was priced in at one time, I'll agree with that.  But we are currently seeing more than double the national daily new cases that we saw in that first "wave," and that build has only really started up in the past month.  That's just not long enough to see further market effects when we talk about reported earnings, long-term employment outlook, inflation, action by the Fed, etc. that could all have an effect on the market, eg SPY.  

Separately, business rules/shutdowns/mask regulations aside, the sheer volume of cases will have continued dampening effects on consumer sentiment, spending and consumption we can't measure for yet.  There is a measurable non-zero consumer response to all this, even if nothing is mandated to be shut down.  This is also leaving out the fact that unemployment will likely continue to grow.

Saying any and every concern around COVID is already baked in to market expectations is either dishonest or incredibly short-sighted.> COVID is absolutly priced in right now.

Yes, the global pandemic that has locked the country down is so priced in that the NASDAQ hit new ATHs after the start of shutdowns, and the S&P500 and DJI are a hop, skip, and jump away from their own previous ATHs, all while almost every state is hastily rolling back reopening plans and issuing new mandatory mask orders.

To say that newer companies have employees from older companies is kind of like...yeah, that's going to happen. I assume that Tesla is claiming that Rivian is directly offering it's people some perk in order to get them to move companies.Nobody read the articleYet Tesla builds a plant in China where clearly all their secrets will be stolen... it must be great to have another country do all your research and development and then you just get to make/copy the end result.That’s a clean- looking truckTwo of the four named employees are HR/recruiters. One is environmental health and safety manager, and one is a product manager on supercharger network. They appear to be targeting people who might know who the good employees are to recruit from Tesla, not engineers with some top secret technology. I know it sucks to have good people leave for another company, but Tesla benefited from good people leaving other companies to join them. It's a two way street. I would avoid joining Tesla as an engineer, you don't want to deal with these bitter litigious companies if you ever decide to leave.You can "poach" employees in California, it's a no non-compete state.

Also, 4 out of 178 former Tesla employees who went to Rivian supposedly "stealing" documents is not a "pattern." Seems like Tesla wants to intimidate Rivian and its former employees. All the more reason to avoid Tesla as an employer, if you didn't have enough already.The thief was caught emailing confidential documents to her own gmail account.

“On July 7, 2020, after her conversation With Duran and the same day that Wong received an update on her background check by Rivian, she sent at least sixteen highly confidential and trade secret recruiting documents from Tesla’s network to her Gmail account, including various guides and templates developed by Tesla—the very types of documents that Duran had instructed her that Rivian needed.”

https://electrek.co/2020/07/23/tesla-sues-rivian-stealing-trade-secrets/I've never heard of Rivian, when's the IPO I'm all in if Tesla is mad at them.[deleted]Only some of their stuff is open source, taking the rest is called stealingIt’s weird that a couple of years ago Tesla was giving away their patents and bragging about poaching employees from Apple...now this.Wasn't Elon big on sharing technology to advance the world or something?Hmmm, wonder what Tesla bulls think about them being this worried about Rivian.Tesla treats their employees like trash and then throws a fit over other company "poaching" them.  Uh huh...Here comes the unhinged Elon. I've been waiting.So much for Musks altruistic desire to spread electric even if it was to the detriment of Tesla.Rivian is outta my price range, but their SUV is *beautiful.*

Nice of Tesla to give them some press.Interesting, but I dont think anything will come of  it. Side note, whatever happened to all the tesla fanboys praising elon for making all his EV tech open source? I mean, one would assume this is what Elon wanted.I hadn't heard of Rivian up until this point. I like the way they look though.Lmao you can sue for poaching employees? Hahahaha oh my god, then take care of them to where they dont want to leave. What a pussified reasoning to sue.[removed]Maybe those employees just fell in love with Normal, IllinoisRivian partnered with Ford. I don’t think they merged though even I think Ford considered it at one timeLol. Tesla wants to monopolize everything. Gets mad when competition starts popping up. Personally I think the Rivian looks much better than the Cybertruck. If I was in the market for an electric vehicle I'd go for the Rivian. 

Also will definitely be hopping onto any Rivian IPO. Especially after seeing Tesla's stock price.Tesla is a sell with both hands as it is the #1 bubble stock on nasdaq with amazonI didn't know rivian and ford were making the same Bronco...HOW THE TURN TABLESIm new to [investing](https://bsadvice.com/) should I buy TSLAGotta find someway to make a profit when those credits run outThis is a large company using its resources to crush a small company because they pose a threat. In addition, it is laughable for a private company to claim intellectual property. The technology that Tesla uses was funded with public money from across the world within tex payer funded institutions. That is why technologies like these should be nationalised.who cares electric vehicles need to happen to save the earth.Poaching employees is as old as time.non-compete clauses are an abomination to market economics and should be banned.

Guess which candidate for president thinks we should [do something about it?](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1209263668736745473)I’m a bit confused about stealing secrets.

Didn’t they make a lot of their IP public? Including some battery tech to encourage future development? (Or am I mis-remembering?)Just started reading about Nikola...What does Tesla vs. Rivian vs. Nikola look like?

Trevor Milton seems like a scam artistI wonder if they’ll survive after they get sued lol this is how a lot of startups just disappear.TSLA bulls so insufferably smug today was fun to watchWhat next AMZN suing bakery for stealing warehouse workers?

Somebody need to slap the big names. Rivian is the only promising competitor make silent but tremendous progress. 
I'm sure Tesla doesn't want a competition. They went with NKLA first and now Rivian?>I assume that Tesla is claiming that Rivian is directly offering it's people some perk in order to get them to move companies.

Is that not allowed?This CNBC piece is light in detail, but that is not what is going on here. Tesla is specifically alleging that these employees brought over proprietary Tesla documents and were induced to do so by Rivian.Unless Tesla had them sign a non-compete I don’t see how a court wouldn’t tell Tesla to go pound sand. The engineering expertise of an employee isn’t a company’s intellectual property.That also happens all the time.  When I've worked for small aerospace companies with startup vibes the same kind of poaching was just business as usual.  Point being that you should never expect your trade secrets to stay secret for long.  They will walk to the next company in the minds of some of your top talent and there is not much you can do to stop it.  This is also why having a good moat around your business is vital.  You need to make it financially harder for new competitors to enter into your business space and take market share.  You can do this by building trust in your brand name and aggressively marketing for new business or with new products.  You can keep innovating new tech to keep ahead of the game.  Patents are great to keep people out of your space for some time.According to the person I know who worked for Tesla, that wouldn’t be hard to do. Apparently they treat their employees like shit.I’d be surprised if space x doesn’t actively do thisRivian is has perception issues in the industry for poaching people and stealing ideasIt has just becomes another daily Tesla discussion post without regards to the article contentNIO probably already built a cloned plant across town lmaoNew TeslaIsn't a lot of Tesla's IP tied to its software and data though? I mean anybody can just buy a car and disassemble it.
    
Kind of like how Apple makes all their iPhones in China but it's not like China suddenly got any more trade secrets that they couldn't have acquired before manufacturing moved there.Honestly still can't believe they built that plant. Like, did no one from the State Dept warn them!?Rivian’s mistake was not paying China for the stolen Tesla tech.> it must be great to have another country do all your research and development and then you just get to make/copy the end result.

Worked out just great for the United States. 
https://www.history.com/news/industrial-revolution-spies-europeCongrats you just discovered how literally every developed country gets to where they are now.It's the same playbook as Apple. In 10 years, Chinese car manufacturer will be the next Huawei for smartphone and we have Elon Musk to blame.

But he'll be rich and making his next startup facade.[This article](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4339781-teslas-transformation-chinese-company-seems-unstoppable) I read a while back (behind SA premium now, unfortunately) outlines the idea pretty well. Tesla's business in China is solely to the benefit and at the approval of CCP.When someone else steals your company secrets and you get no value, that's the issue. Tesla makes more when China steals than when Rivian does. Tesla gets access to cheap materials/labor from China.They don't care about the employees themselves, all they care about it's the documents they took with them. It's a competitive market and to hire the best candidates you have to spend a lot of time developing the right methods and tools and now Rivian can have it all with little effort. That's not fair at all.You're gonna get downvoted by the tesla fuck boysDon't give actual details that provide context. The people have read the headline and made up their minds! /sEven me, as a worker in a public institution, everything I create belongs to the institution. I'm not allowed to use it for anything else.
  
For Tesla,  it's a huge loss of competitivity if it becomes a trend. I understand their point of you. You can leave for another company, just leave what belongs to Tesla at Tesla.I think Ford owns a good chunkAmazon ordered 100,000 vehicles from them.I'm aware of a company that sells go them.  They are building huge, like 5 millions SQ foot plants.  Walmart, Amazon, and Goes have all invested.  Electric trucks that are insanely cool.  Definitely worth a Google.Absolutely beautiful off-road electric trucks. Fully functional with so many features for outside things. Can't wait for them to come outNot sure, but it’s worth noting that trade secrets are not the same thingI believe Tesla open sourced outdated patents that they no longer usedNope. That’s just padding for Elon’s PR campaign as ‘nice guy who only cares about helping the world’IrrelevantMostly a PR move, wasn’t anything of actual valueClearly it's a PR front. A genius one, at that, and gained him many fanboys.Do you think he would be a billionaire, if he did such stuff?My thoughts exactly! Threatened much?Lol why is this downvoted. Musk is loved by lefties but then actively crushes unions in his own company. Not a great work place by any metric.Yea, thats a bad sign. Engineers are over worked like anything, and they don't get paid the best as well. It's only time many such employees leave.I agree there. This is going to spread the word about rivian more than anything else. Everything with Tesla hits front page2 employees uploaded internal pdf’s to their gmail after after recruitment. And also one of them refused to turn their laptop back into Tesla after being hired by Rivian.Your submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*Or they saw a company looking to actually remain in business.SureWow, it's amazing how every single sentence in your comment is astonishingly wrong. Companies work actively to beat competition. And it is public companies who own almost all the intellectual property there is. How old are you?Rivian isn't exactly a brand new start up. They have several billion dollars, offices in multiple states and have been around 10 years. They will be making deliveries in 2021, it's pretty far along in the processI agree, but you can’t let employees walk out the door with your source code either, that’s theft.I understand the reporting on that to have been a little exaggerated, the announcement was much more geared on the PR side. It was more about sharing communications protocols and kernels (things that help them anyway with wider adoption) rather than any patents that help differentiate their products.They offered bi-directional patent indemnification.  You can’t sue tesla and also use their “free” patent.Nikola is still appearing to be a scam, but Rivian is very real. Close ties with ford and a huge order from amazon. They are the real deal and Tesla is now obviously taking them seriously.Rivian isn't going anywhere because of a Tesla lawsuit. They are backed by ford, Amazon, and investments from Standard chartered and T Rowe. I think they have a couple billion in capital and will be delivering vehicles early 2021What a terrible day. Went from 550% gains to only 500% lmaoIronically Amazon is a backer of RivianIt's allowed, but when it's lawsuit material it's usually because company a believes company b is trying to get it's employees in an effort to possibly damage company a and/or liberate it's secrets and know-how.It's not allowed to hire an employee to try and recreate trade secrets from another company. Depending on what's going on there could be something wrong here.Non-disclosure, non-compete agreements are very common.  I am not a lawyer, but I don't think it's legal for one company to offer to help employees of another company break their employment contract. I think it's tortious inference. And if they're stealing trade secrets that's a violation of the economic espionage act.Not a lawyer but i  would imagine Tesla is claiming that the former employees are bringing Tesla's secrets over to themDepends on the role, if NDA was signed, but in general yes it happens... however most tech companies make new hires sign IP and patent agreements (i work in HR for a software company)I wonder if Rivian allow unions, unlike Tesla.

Maybe Tesla needs to do like Ford in the old days and pay employees really well.Ask Elon. He was the one doing the poaching last round... 
https://www.thedailybeast.com/spacex-stole-our-best-minds-chip-maker-sues-elon-musk-startupHey smart guy. Learn that thing we need to know and then quit for more money and do it here.Too lazy to source but Tesla for sure has
Poached tooDepends if company A had a non-compete agreement. While they’re usually way overused, I can see the value of a non-compete in engineering/tech fields where the RandD investment is huge for new creations, and new creations usually require building up that persons skill and knowledge. Rivian is basically taking Tesla’s investment into the person (asset) and converting the asset into their own profit. 

If there are specialized skills and knowledge that are valuable to Tesla, They should be able to stop the employee from taking that knowledge and giving it to Rivian.Tesla would seem to be justified in filing suit with that information.Yes, but the trade secret theft claim is still valid even in California, assuming they have the evidence to prove it.If they are california employees, then the non compete is very useful when toilet paper runs outNon-compete is one thing, and as noted before hard to enforce especially in some locations, but an NDA is another matter.Considering, I'm guessing there was some sort of non-compete signed.Pay politicians to pass expensive and expansive regulations to which startup or small business can comply. Bonus points if they are esoteric and weird enough that no foreign government has similar regulations in place to stifle competition from international companies.I've known some people, indirectly, that have worked for them as well. I've heard similar stories.

They're no longer with the company.Musk Vs BezosChina, no lawz about anythingErlich Bachman? Is that you??I'm going to wager there is a lot of magic happening outside of vehicle memory.Chinese markets are huge, and they have awful regulation. It makes sense to go there if you don't mind the oppressive Communist government.Dude, China is the biggest auto market in the world, it's bigger than even the US. It's simply not viable to be competitive in the market there without building the cars locally. It costs a ton of money (and time) to ship a fully assembled car across the sea.

AND the Chinese government is heavily pushing people towards EVs. You have to win a lottery if you want to buy an ICE car there, whereas you get to skip the lottery if you buy an EV.where else can you find literal slave labor?>~~Tesla's~~ business in China is solely to the benefit and at the approval of CCP.What documents do you think an HR person took with them?
To hire the best candidates, you have to spend a lot of time not building a reputation as a sweatshop that might go after you if you ever decide to leave.For the record, I upvoted him, but I don’t like non-competes, they’re abused by an increasing number companies as a way to hold back raises or retain employees in toxic environments. In this case though... if the employees mentioned were in research positions, this is the kind of stuff that non-compete contracts have a legitimate case for. There is a legitimate purpose here because billions of dollars have been invested to create the technology. 

Software patents are a controversial minefield because sometimes there’s only one way to do something right and the terms of many patents are absurdly broad or vague. 

A software developer at Tesla can always just go work for another company that doesn’t make cars. A software developer at Google or Amazon may have more trouble finding another company that doesn’t compete with Google or Amazon in some way. 

The decision of some states to determine that non-competes are automatically enforceable or unenforceable is pretty absurd and over applied. The situation needs redefined in a way that prevents employees from being liable, protects companies from losses of legitimate cost and effort, and protects employees from becoming trapped working at one company because the terms of competition are too broad.and AMZNTrade secrets also have no protection, so no point in suing. Sounds like Tesla is just desperateIirc the patents were for things like charging adapter designs. Opening them up was an attempt to make the design an industry standard. It means we could build up a consistent recharge station infrastructure across the country instead of building tesla recharge stations, Rivien stations, Ford stations, etc.Similar working conditions at Space X. I know a guy who used to work there. He went from quirky and delightful to cynical and anxious (to the point of needing therapy) in less than a year and a half.Musk isn’t loved by “lefties” at all, lol. Maybe on paper to people who aren’t involved in politics at more than a surface level.People just read the headline and just imagine how it went down without reading a sungle detail.Calm down. Read again.Wow I didn’t know that’s crazyyyy. I shall dig deeper in to this company, thank you for the information!Perhaps company a should pay more then if those employees are so valuable.What’s wrong is the disclosure. No problem with hiring the employees, but the moment they talk about IP that violates their NDA, both the employee and company are liable.Why? If they bought the talent, why are they not allowed to exploit it?Non-disclosure and non-competes are generally unenforceable unless the employer compensates the signee (the employee) by paying them at minimum as much as they made while still employed for however many years the agreement covers. 

If an employee stops getting paid by their former employer they are generally allowed to share anything the learned during that employment.Aren't non-compete agreements almost completely unenforceable?We have this even at Jimmy Johns. Can’t leave and go to a different franchise one or a competitor for a few months.They do pay really well. And they design and manufacture in the US. It’s awesome>Hey smart guy. Learn that thing we need to know and then quit for more money and do it here.

 Is..is *that* not allowed?They have poached a ton of talent from software companies like google in the past.  Its SV, thats what they do.Right, people are focusing on the poaching part. What’s really an issue is targeting their employees that know how a piece of technology works and then having them Seville proprietary information to them.

How would they prove this? Have an employee you trust apply at the company and gather evidence as a double agent. It’s been done before.Heard the same from people who worked for Space X.  Musk tends to take advantage of young ambitious fanboy/fangirl employees, overworking them for relatively low payIt's making a profit today in exchange for selling away the future. Wouldn't be surprised if Tesla cars were flat out banned in China in 10 years.If you are a billionaire investor, the communist government is not likely to oppress you.Market size for Tesla goes to 0 when the CCP bans foreign auto makers. Just give it some time, ~10 years.Also trueThe lawsuit says documents related to recruiting templates, structures, formulas, candidates lists and skills, existing staff salary structures, files on executive level candidates. That's definitely important information for a company that hires thousands of people to stay competitive in the job market. 

Do you think people who join Tesla don't know it's not a sweat shop and pays lower than say a similar FAANG job? i know PhD students in my lab who interned at Tesla and work full time there now. All of them are the smartest folks I've ever met and they of course had offers from Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple. They know they were going to be getting paid a lot less and they'll have to work their ass off but all of them joined Tesla. I guess the reputation of being a place where you have a lot of emphasis on R&D and freedom to experiment and work on a real world product with some of the brightest minds around is definitely an incentive for many people.Very well thought out and written.and TROWUm... Trade secrets most certainly do have protection.Trade secrets are a type of intellectual property and so are subject to IP infringement laws.[18 USC 1836](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defend_Trade_Secrets_Act)

Literally every state also has its own trade secret protections. You are very VERY misinformedBeautiful trucks and SUVs, watch some videos. They are amazing productsThat often doesn't work in practice.

Suppose you have the highest pay in the industry.  You spend $1B researching 500 different formulas for batteries.  Any of them is simple enough that anybody could memorize them.  It turns out that 499 of them are duds, but 1 of them is a significant improvement.

Here is the problem - that formula is something that dozens of employees at least end up knowing.  It cost the company $1B to obtain that formula - not so much to obtain the formula but to figure out that this is the one worth putting in the product.

Now some other company can just offer one of those dozen employees $1M as a signing bonus and they get a $1B secret.  So, pay them all $10M a year!  Well, now the company can offer $100M and STILL get a $1B secret.  

And it wasn't like any of those dozen employees "discovered" that formula due to their ingenuity and deserve all the money personally.  Maybe those 500 formulas are just all random tweaks of a common formula, and it was purely trial and error that lead to the right formula.  ANYBODY who did the work would have discovered it - the company just had to assign the testing to 100 scientists testing 5 formulas each at great expense, and one got lucky, purely because they were lucky.

While I agree that companies should pay employees well to retain them, that doesn't mean that this is a substitute for IP law.  If you make the cheapest approach to R&D to let somebody else do the work and then just poach their employees for a bit more, then nobody will do R&D, and all of those employees will end up unemployed.

Don't get me wrong - I think that plenty of employees are underpaid or not given sufficient bonuses for their creative discoveries.  However, the person who pulls the ball out of the lottery machine shouldn't get a cut of the jackpot every time somebody wins just for being the person who drew the ball.As an engineer who doesn’t work in that industry but works for a consulting company that has projects for Tesla’s battery factory, they do pay them a lot. But it’s possible that rivian either pays them the same or less for a lower expected work output. Like yeah it’s nice getting paid 50-75k more than other engineering jobs, but it’s also nice not being expected to have the same work mentality as your ceo.Pay is not everything it's the biggest factor but other things play a factor. If you are getting a few thousand more it's not gonna be life changing to make you always want to leave. People and culture make you stayU daft?

B pays more than A.
If A pays more, then B pays more.
B pays more than A.
If A pays more, then B pays more.

But ya, A just needs to find the magical number that will prevent B from paying more to extract trade secrets likely worth millions or even billions. 😑It's not just about NDAs or non-competes or any of that. If an employee has access to trade secrets and then he joins a different company and helps them recreate those trade secrets that violates IP law.

Trade secrets are very specific things, it's not just anything the employee worked on.

 [https://ogletree.com/insights/departing-employees-ensuring-protection-of-trade-secrets-and-intellectual-property/](https://ogletree.com/insights/departing-employees-ensuring-protection-of-trade-secrets-and-intellectual-property/) 

Relevant quote from an international perspective: " Typically, the only protection that survives is a requirement to preserve secrecy in relation to “confidential information.” However, even then, it is often only the most sensitive trade secrets that are protected. Disputes can arise over what constitutes a trade secret of the sort an employer can own (as unique to the employer) versus mere general “know-how” which the employee picks up through doing the work. "

So, even in the absence of any agreement, many countries protect specific types of confidential information which often includes trade secrets.Usually you sign a lot of documents (non-disclosures + non-competes)regarding who owns different kinds of software/hardware/manufacturing applications/designs. As an engineer myself you have to agree that you won't work in X for X years/months after leaving a position or you open yourself up to a lawsuit.Because what you work on at X company while employed and were paid for belongs to X company.I don’t know the specific laws, it’s just not allowed. I’ve received training on it at large corporations and they advise R&D teams to carefully avoid even the appearance of impropriety when employees may have trade secret knowledge that they’ve brought over from other companies. Trade secrets are also specific things, it’s not just a catch all for everything. Companies have to take specific actions to identify and protect what they consider to be trade secrets.

You can read more here: https://www.dlapiperaccelerate.com/knowledge/2017/best-practices-in-hiring-to-protect-trade-secrets.html> Non-disclosure and non-competes are generally unenforceable unless the employer compensates the signee (the employee) by paying them at minimum as much as they made while still employed for however many years the agreement covers.

That is true for non-compete agreements, but generally not for non-disclosure.  

The reason for this is that a non-compete agreement basically denies an employee the ability to work in their chosen field AT ALL except for one employer (who obviously then wields inappropriate power in setting their salary).

However, a nondisclosure agreement doesn't interfere with anybody working in any job.  They just can't talk about the work they did for the other company, or directly replicate it (in the sense of discovery - if you were paid to type up letters you can obviously type up letters at the new company, but you can't tell your new boss that your old boss is working on a new product line which you learned from typing up one of his letters).

Just about every company requires NDAs and they're really not a big deal.  They still get skirted to a degree - you can't talk about exactly what your employer did before but often people end up taking advantage of processes they learned about.  However, if a battery chemist at Tesla ended up introducing the same chemistry at Ford, they could get in a lot of trouble.

Also, you're allowed to use the benefit of experience.  If you do some job for 10 years at one company, chances are you're a lot better at it after 10 years, and you don't have to pretend that you're fresh out of college at the new job.  You just can't actually borrow your previous work products at the new company (like copying source code as a programmer).

Really though the laws for NDAs are pretty reasonable and practical.  It is non-compete agreements that tend to get a lot of abuse.  I wouldn't lump them together.

Now, in practice it is very hard to enforce an NDA because it can be hard to tell that it was breached.  In contrast a non-compete is easy to enforce assuming it is legal, because simply getting the job is a breach.I don’t know where you live, but In the US this isn’t the law at all. And I don’t see how it would be the law anywhere. Pay an employee his full salary for doing no work for years on end so he can’t work for an employer? Name one situation where this is the caseThey're unenforceable in the sense that an employer cannot prevent a former employee from being gainfully employed in the future.  In this case, if your expertise is electric vehicles, then the non compete probably can't prevent you from working for another electric vehicle manufacturer.  However, it can prevent you from creating copycat technology or otherwise directly damage your previous employer.

The burden to prove that the noncomplete prevents them from making a living is generally on the former employee, and its expensive to fight in court, so people tend to abide by them.They are very enforceable in places where several companies work in the same industry and are engineering heavyNot sure why people think this, they are very enforceable if they aren’t overly broad in geographic area, scope, and timeNo one will ever call you out for switching fast food jobs like this, it's just a useless flex companies use to reduce employee turnover.Not when the thing you’re learning is a trade secretIt is if you're China.

I'm only half kidding. People like to point the finger and at China and pretend US companies aren't just as cut-throat when it comes to IP, technology, "trade secrets", etc. Truth is, if you ain't cheatin, you aint tryin.I do know someone directly that went to work for SpaceX. While I don't keep in contact with him (former co-worker,) he seemed pretty happy as a systems programmer.They do the same thing with their customers...With CW2, I wouldn't be surprised if they were banned tomorrow.Except for the whole "Intellectual property theft", the arbitrary detention, the censorship thing, etc.It's all fun and games until Tesla burns them out and then kneecaps their careers on the way out if they decide to go to a competitor.No, you should review the law. There is 0 trade secret protection. Tesla may have a contract with a specific employee to not divulge secrets. They can go after that employee if they do, but Tesla has no legal ground to go after any one that learned of said secret. For that Tesla needs a patent.Fucking thank you. Man, it gets my goat anytime someone tries to oversimplify something and deem it the most logic answer. "pay your staff more and it's not a problem" yeah... Ok.... Sure. Which multi-billion dollar company do you run with words so wise? You're explanation was perfect. Right on.I never thought about this, but thank you for writing this. I never understood how poaching employees would work if they are legally not allowed to trade secrets, but in this case the secret may not even be a secret. Thanks!This is why Bush’s baked beans kept it a family secretthanks for taking the timeIf only we had some way to legally protect new tech innovations, so you could get exclusive rights to the improvement for a number of years.

I'm going to write my Congress person.It’s hard drawing the line as well.  Who is to say that rather than 500 formulas it shouldn’t have been 5000 or 50000 formulas to try simply because Tesla itself hired a person or people from some other random company.  This situation would make Tesla the lawsuit target instead.  Fun fun!Yes, that's the way bidding wars typically work. The bidding will go up to the true value of the employee. It's the same thing that happens with any scare commodity.

Employees are at will these days in nearly every state. If company A needs that employee that badly, perhaps they should pay enough that the employee won't leave.Are you daft?And those clauses are unenforceable. The liability lies with the company, not the employee.While you're right of course that NDAs and Non-competes shouldnt be lumped together NDAs still require due-consideration (in effect, a compensation for being signed) and while simply employment is enough to sign one at the outset, new consideration is needed for every thereafter signed NDA. 

My point which I took as given, which I shouldnt have, is that any NDA signed at the beginning of an employment wouldnt not just have to be well crafted but literally incredibly lucky in what it pertains in order to specifically cover the work being done even just a year from inception in such a frontier invention work such as the work done at Tesla. As broad NDAs (ex: you cant ever share anything you see or hear or learn while working here) effectively arent enforceable new more specific NDAs have to be crafted and signed at every significant enough breakthrough and new consideration (and thereby, compensation) is needed for every one. 

So while NDAs dont require continous compensation such as non-competes I still find it unlikely that an engineer that is experienced enough to be poached (must have worked for several years at tesla) will have been sufficiently covered by specifically constructed NDAs needed to completely inhibit them to share information from their former job. 

Any decent employer would simply have its legal team look over the NDAs of the new employee and conclude what isnt sufficiently covered by NDA specificity and thereby could be shared. 

That is unless the employee was an idiot and shared something that only has to be specified once and will be unchanged enough to forever be covered, like a client list.In california this is most definitely the case. Where both Rivian and Tesla are active.>And I don’t see how it would be the law anywhere. Pay an employee his full salary for doing no work for years on end so he can’t work for an employer?

Sometimes it's not a full salary but something like 75%. And quite a few countries have this, yes. Mine included: Portugal. 

If the company doesn't want to pay, the employee can go work for whoever they want.

The alternative is that someone is out of a job for years because they missed some clause in their contract.Lmao I know I just do the delivery job for extra money since being a high school math teacher can only pay for so much"Trade secrets" should not be legally protected in a free market.This just seems like the world of cut throat corporatism. Which I could not care less about. So if some guy gets poached by someone offering a better deal...I mean, take it.You normally gotta pay double for that kind of action.Again, I don't really agree with that. Every prior case I know where Tesla accused engineers of stealing tech while leaving to a different company was found out to be true. I can cite the examples of Zoox vs Tesla where Tesla filed a law suit against some employees who stole proprietary schematics and they were clearly proven to be true and Zoox agreed and settled. Then there's also the Tesla vs Xpeng case where Tesla claimed that an employee stole auto pilot code while leaving to Xpeng. Although this law suit is still in discovery phase, the employee accepted before court that he uploaded parts of autopilot codebase to his personal iCloud account.You can go after the new employer where they are actively encouraging the theft of trade secrets, which is what Tesla is alleging.

>In about the past week, Tesla has discovered disturbing pattern of employees who are departing for Rivian surreptitiously stealing Tesla trade secret, confidential, and proprietary information — information that is especially useful for startup electric vehicle company. And Rivian encourages those thefts even though Rivian is well aware of Tesla employees’ confidentiality obligation

Even then, state trade secret acts can be more protective.You should have been a lawyer instead of reddit shit poster.Edit: nvm, US is dumb. Public can't benefit from discoveries while also allowing finder to profit.With you.> in this case the secret may not even be a secret

and if this "method" is patented, then company A won't have the problem of company B trying to steal it. Company A wants to retain the knowledge forever, and profit off it. I dont think it's in the interest of society to have this sort of trade secret tbh.A trade secret is legally protected that's why there is a lawsuitHey, I'm not saying that Tesla is in the right in this particular case.  A court would need to hear the arguments.

My point is just that there needs to be a balance.  An employer can't keep you from working for somebody else.  However, that doesn't mean that it is ok to be mining former employees for company secrets either.  I have no idea whether the latter happened in this particular case, but it certainly is reasonable for a court to hear the argument.Except not when trade secrets are at play. You aren't allowed to hire someone and use them to extract trade secrets from a competitor. As someone else in the thread pointed out, if you could do that then company A could do a billion dollars worth of research, and company B could come over and offer a 10 million signing bonus to come over and share the results. 

If they're changing employers and conforming to their NDA then yeah, no problem. But in an emerging tech like EVs, it would be damned hard as an engineer to basically work with your hands tied behind your back by ignoring better ways to do things that you picked up from your ex employer.Not functionally in the real world though. It often leads to employees getting fired soon after if A wins. B gets sued and might fire the employee as well anyhow. If your girl leaves her now ex for you, that's a bad sign.

Plus the budget interests are so unequal. Bidding wars are only real during the hiring process of A vs B, and even then barely.

In the real world these theoretical ideas fall short at best. I've worked with way too many startups trying to "get the best". Many times it's a circlejerk without a point. Unless you trying to up your payroll expenses by 100%. And even then, another circle.> broad NDAs (ex: you cant ever share anything you see or hear or learn while working here) effectively arent enforceable

Do you have a citation for this?

As far as I'm aware it isn't legal to share what was going on at your former employer simply because you didn't sign a new NDA every year.In California they only restrict non-competes, you can’t disclose trade secrets post employmentGood luck.Why?That’s why you have a free market with protections for innovation. The trademark, copyright and patent policy of the US has caused major innovation due to its legal protections. Companies and people have incentive to invest into innovation. 

Not saying people don’t abuse the system, but when it’s working well, it really pushes progress/r/Woooosh 

(sorry)All good and that’s a great point about employee mining.Stifles innovation and the spread of ideas. If an idea is so critical to the success of your business that you cant let anyone else see it, the onus is on you to take the necessary steps to protect it.> The trademark, copyright and patent policy of the US has caused major innovation due to its legal protections.

Except it hasn't. The vast majority of innovative research and development happens in publicly funded agencies and universities, and the results are largely open to exploitation from the market.

>Not saying people don’t abuse the system, but when it’s working well, it really pushes progress

Not on any significant scale.Not really. I'm pretty sure u/enleeten was suggesting we use patents as those last a certain number of years. Since trade secrets are not registered they do not expire. In this case Tesla likely made a choice to keep something a trade secret and protect it as such to specifically not have to disclose the secret in a patent filling.Good luck getting companies to spend billions in R&D just so some slouch can come along and take all the profits.Do me a favor and google the stats for copyrights and patents and let me know where the publicly funded research falls on who has the most patents, copyrigjts etc.

I’m not saying you’re wrong, innovation in some areas is driven by research universities and the public sector (behavioral sciences, NASA, etc). But on the whole, when we think of innovation at the “start-up” level, PTO protections are crucial at incentivizing this investment

If you don’t believe me, look at the data on countries without protections and where they don’t honor protections of other countries and see how diluted they get and how little actual progress is made internallyoh i seeWhat are they doing so wrong that some slouch can manage to take their most important secrets?> Do me a favor and google the stats for copyrights and patents and let me know where the publicly funded research falls on who has the most patents, copyrigjts etc.

You know that only really supports my point, right? Yes, I am aware that companies will patent every single minor variation of every single product. That's the problem.

>But on the whole, when we think of innovation at the “start-up” level, PTO protections are crucial at incentivizing this investment

You're thinking of micro-innovation, which the free market does indeed excel at.

Many of them are like where I will be in two weeks where all benefits have run out and I cannot claim unemployment anymore. I thus won’t count as a number but I won’t have money coming in. 

This is going to be very bad for the economyThat is a lot of unemployed people. You have to feel for them. No one could have expected this.The initial jobless numbers are not great: 
Initial jobless claims, week ended July 18: 1.416 million vs. 1.3 million expected and 1.307 million during the prior weekSo New unemployment claims are UP by 100k (from last week) But continuing claims are down. I wish they broke down the numbers regionally because I assume Covid spikes are seeing a spike in Unemployment while other areas like NY are ending claims. I do expect the first UI for August to wayyy down on continuing claims. A lot of systems only allow for 3 months before the state benefits dry up .Until white collar workers get affected, nobody is going to care. Markets won’t react to Main StreetThere's 16m people continued to be unemployed an the extra 600/week is ending at the end of this month.

That is not bullish.The official report has plenty of data for the economic nerds out there. 

https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/OPA/newsreleases/ui-claims/20201453.pdf


I feel so desensitized from the numbers already:

The total number of people claiming benefits in all programs for the week ending July 4 was **31,802,715**, a decrease of
200,615 from the previous week. There were **1,725,953** persons claiming benefits in all programs in the comparable
week in 2019. 

The largest increases in initial claims for the week ending July 11 were in Florida (+65,890), Georgia (+33,292),
California (+20,123), Washington (+16,116), and Indiana (+6,258), while the largest decreases were in Maryland
(-13,728), Texas (-11,583), New Jersey (-8,577), Michigan (-6,882), and Louisiana (-5,066).I am proud to say that after losing my job due to covid I was able to land a job with a better work life balance. Only took about 2.5 months but I blanketed companies with resumes and tapped into my network.16.2 million is a good number because they expected 17.1 million, but if they had expected 15.3 million then 16.2 million would be bad?Still pretty fucking highDoesn’t the PPP loan end in August? I would expect more layoffs to come once we get thereWe open red and finish green as usual

Edit : We RektIt’s not very exciting to beat such low expectations.a lot of the unemployment is running out.  It only covers 13 weeks in some states.>Initial July claim: 1.416 mil vs 1.3 mil expected (This means first-time unemploymenr insurance benefit filings) 
>Continuing claims: 16.197 mil vs 17.1 mil expected

Should we be added continuing claims and new claims for this week?  

Total for this week is 17,163k jobless claims (initial plus continuing).

Last week: New Claims: 1,300K, Continuing claims: 17,338K, Total Claims: 18,638k

There are 1,475k less people making jobless claims this week compared to last week.It’s not going to get better until things change. The line is being drawn and the new elites are falling into old habits. 
Humans are so short sighted for being able to predict the future outcomes of frameworks.Please post the real, DOL link.I don’t get these weekly and monthly jobless claims as well as expectations. This is insanity to me. Why are people focused so much on rates. The total amount of unemployed Americans since March and are still currently unemployed is 🤯US daily death higher: 100 daily by now vs 1200Expected? There's a fucking typo on the title...jeezuz khristI too can expect a lower amount on my salary every two weeks and be pleasantly surprised that it's higher

&#x200B;

lmaoPermanent job loss is up and unemployment benefits are down starting Friday. It’s really too bad for a lot of people in the US right now. I’m not feeling bullish.Not surprising since the unemployment supplement is going away and people are now forced to risk their health for shelter / food.[removed]The expectations were to high but the jobless is way to high regardlessBuy! Buy! Buy!U ob0That's the seasonally adjusted number. The non-seasonally adjusted number went up MoM, and there's a pretty solid reason to believe the seasonal adjustment this year might be off.Better than expected but this is still truly awful news for the economy long term. Over 16m is huge numbers of unemployment..Eventually people will get their jobs back, predicting when though is a bit of a gamble lol especially in florida16M? Lower? Is this weekly, monthly? 16M is a lotThis literally says nothing.There are still a lot of people having trouble getting UI. Could that be keeping the numbers low? I don't know enough about how they count claims.Have you factored in the amount of people being in pay role for PPP reasons into your calculus OP?It will be interesting to watch and see how /r/investing trys to reconcile this. Usually the jobs data is garbage if its good, while an herald of the end times if its bad.

So what will the circlejerk be when continuing claims are lower than expected (good - thus we are supposed to hate it) while initial claims are higher than expected (bad - thus we should embrace it as a herald of doom)?

Edit: Once again, I'm 100% on target - there is so much mental contortion going on in this thread with people trying to figure out how to spin this into economic doom porn.Jesus christ. This is the worst economic crisis we have ever had.


Call it wishful thinking but if the economy can decline so fast, then it can bounce back so fast aswell.Fintech layoffs ? Very interesting, almost hard to believe considering everyone keeps saying fin tech is the future and there’s soo much demand for fintech talent wKawhi o zShort puts on anything jobs and trump as china will make sure trump is out in 3 months[deleted]Hmm wonder why ppl are jobless?! Stop paying them more to be jobless then they make when they work. They wont because dumbacrats want thins to be shit until they can lie their way into power potentiallyIts interesting how a million people filed, but two million found jobsIf you're unemployed why wouldn't you be able to claim unemployment?Don't these numbers reflect first-time filers?

So people who fall off unemployment aren't counted regardlessTruer words never spoken.

My 30+ year career is being a sound guy.  You know, for concerts and large meetings of people.  I haven't had a gig since early march.  My next gig is penciled in for late October.> No one could have expected this.

Some people, including Bill Gates, have been warning that we are not ready for a respiratory pandemic for years.

Nobody could have predicted when, but there’s people who definitely saw this coming.Uhh except ya know... the government who was warned by the CDC team in China but refused to do anything. Or Italy when it was on lockdown a whole month before us... 

Lol 

If every state just issued mandatory masks when in public with steep fines, we’d be fine.It is a lot, but given how much of the economy is effectively shuttered due to COVID, it's shocking to me that the number isn't 2 or 3 times higher. 

And it's surprising how fast the continuing claims are declining.[removed]I assume a portion of unemployed are choosing to be unemployed as they are earning far more in unemployment benefits + bonus than going to work (minus expenses such as travel and child care).I don't want to sound insensitive and I fully understand the pain of most unemployed people (I am one myself at the moment), but this coronavirus and lockdown has been a financial blessing for me personally.

I got laid off in June and got almost 4 months additional salary as a part of my severance package and I just recently secured another job a few days back with higher salary and will be starting soon. The amount that I received in total and was able to save and invest is much more than if I still had my old job.we (USA) did have a 2 month heads up.na the majority is kids who were never employed ..fake news

There is plenty of shit that can go wrong. To assume that people’s shitty lives can’t get shittier is naive. And people with shitty lives need to prepare for that.True, no one thought we'd shut down for a virus less infectious than the flu.On August 1st there will most likely be massive layoffs.I think it’s a double edged sword that the number is dropping - sure, we want less people to be unemployed for economic and societal reasons. But you really have to ask if all of these people are going back to work too soon. We’ve already seen clear cut cases where several states reopened far too fast, far too early - like Texas and Arizona.>No one could have expected this.

\*No one could have expectee this.Let's give a special shout out and thanks to the governors of California / New York for keeping a big portion of their economies closed for 4+ months and destroying the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of their residents!

The odds of a pandemic restarting in their states are incredibly high even after they've bankrupted hundreds of their small businesses. Just delaying the inevitable.> No one could have expected this.

Wait you guys really didn't see this coming? They said we'd need to do shelter-in-place for 6-18 months back in February...A lot of people expected this actually...I think your last sentence could be debated, or rephrased at least. No one wanted this. But this was a worst case scenario in the "what could happen" that unfortunately was drowned outRight. This is the first week out of 15 that the weekly number has risen more than expected. Which is not a good signal about employment in general. This is a result of pullback from Covid spikes for sure.I think some states put out their own unemployment numbers. Digging through that data would be a pain though...[deleted]That's definitely the impression I'm getting but I don't really know what's going on. Surely they can sense their own finances being jeopardized...Hospitality and marketing/advertising have seen tons of white collar layoffs. The market doesn't care because of stimulus.Lots of salaries have been cut.. it’s definitely impacting a lot of white collar workers, which in turn slows the recovery for blue collar workers. 
[salary cuts](https://www.fastcompany.com/90500004/pandemic-pay-cuts-the-growing-list-of-companies-reducing-salaries-during-covid-19)White-collar has been affected. Ive seen tons of companies laying off people at well-paying jobs. Linkedin just laid off 1,000 people.They havent been?

Major companies in my industry have laid off significant portions of their workforces.Price follows earnings. Lots of companies haven't reduced earnings substantially, so far.We’ll likely have a reduction in the total size of the workforce as the 50+ year olds can’t find a new role.It won't end. Most that will happen is it gets cut in half.I bet there is a huge continued unemployed drop next week. Everyone freaking out their gravy train is about to end and they will have to go back to work.So sell for right now and then buy when shit hits the fan?I think we're all *way* too desensitized to all of this. Reality hasn't sunk in yet.

Almost 32 *million* people are on unemployment. I mean, holy shit!Congrats!Which industries did you jump from / to?Yeah I am looking at this as a new chapter! I was let go from a great job where I was making good money and had goals. Now I know what I am worth and what I can offer and aiming bigger than ever. I been sending so many resumes out with no luck yet but I have a feeling I will find something.High level comment, thank youYou sound like my girlfriendWhich states?In Ohio at least, extended is good until the end of December.It's simple.

TBH, the numbers are couched in terminology that, if I were paranoid, I'd say were designed to not necessarily be misleading but certainly make you go "Wait a minute, slow down and repeat that..."Are you asking yahoo finance or the US government 🤔?Are peoples' unemployment benefits running out a good thing? You find weird stuff to be happy about.Irrelevant because the fed printers are still running and thats all that matters at the end of the dayr/investing

r/investingWish in one hand and s*** in the other see which one fills up fasterWhere are you getting southwest cutting 100k jobs? They only have 61k employees.This is an incredibly dumb comment. I didnt ask for Covid to lay me off nor did anybody else. I didnt ask to lose my seniority at the company I was at. I didnt ask to buy a house and then lose my job. I didn't ask to make less than half of what I was making bc I'd rather be on unemployment. I didn't ask for no call backs or interviews to the 100's of applications ive sent out.

Go fuck yourself you shitstain. People like you deserve the gulag.Two million people didn't find jobs. Two million people stopped filing unemployment insurance claims. 

That's a huge difference.It only lasts for a set period of time.well there are some state regulations that can disqualify you from unemployment like gig workers, part time etc. and not to mention that the unemployment website is almost constantly down. I know people who've been on the phone and spamming the website for months with no availThere's a limit to how long you can claim unemploymentYou could be one of the poor souls living in Florida.There's several states that are still backlogged.In my case I lost my job in January with a contracting firm when they had their contract cut and there was no other position to put me in

I'm in the National Guard so I was planning on just finding some random trainings to go to here and there to get some more experience and some spending cash while I'm finishing up my degree. All my training got canceled for March and I didn't even bother looking since since I figured it was all canceled. Since I'm not full time with the guard and was only doing "extra" I was told I didn't qualify for unemployment even though I've lost out on thousands of dollars of income at this point. I'm lucky I had savings or I'd be screwed. Still upset that I'm not quite as fiscally sound as I wanted, but I'll make itThey might be referring to the extended benefits of $600 a week in the US, this is due to end with the month of JulyFunny because in England being a sound guy means being a top blokeAs a photographer, I haven't had one since Mid-February. I was close to one during that month but we all know what happened.I work big events in tech, I feel bad for the thousands of backstage crew people who are out of work. I've now switched over to putting on virtual events, but the guys I usually work with aren't so lucky.I feel your pain. I own a catering company, specializing in weddings and large events, and also do a ton of catering on site for a large college football program. We had double digit weddings cancelled, football season could be scrapped, and nobody is holding large events now. People talk a lot about the restaurant industry suffering, but the event industry has been hit the worst of any industry there is. People are still going out to eat or getting to go. Events aren’t happening at all. If the govt doesn’t do something serious to help out this industry it’ll cease to exist by the time this is all overRight, and then you think about the next layer of pain...there was just an auction here (sf bay area) of an entire rental house's inventory. Had to stop myself from buying a lot of gear I don't need at pennies on the dollar.

And then I get emails daily (I'm a lampie at times, don't judge) from Chamys -- "new arena-scale console, sign up for training seminar" and I'm thinking, damn absolutely NOBODY is gonna be buying that shit right now.I'm a DP, I feel your painI’m part of the events industry. I’m lucky because my non event work is keeping me very busy, but I’ve been watching as almost everyone in my professional circle suffocates from the complete halt of all meetings, conferences and special events.

Many are in their late career and will probably never come back. It’s brutal.Oh, you're doing sound for your state's mass funeral?Have you looked up sounding videos on pornhub?Yeah there's an entire branch of epidemiology devoted to pandemic respiratory pathogens. Lots of people definitely predicted this. 

But also the media is making way too many rosy claims about the economy while people are still getting giant UE/stimulus supplements. The real impact of all of this isn't going to be for several more months when people are no longer getting paid $22/hr on unemployment, small businesses are no longer getting funds, stimulus checks are no longer a thing, and payment forbearances are over.> Some people, including Bill Gates, have been warning that we are not ready for a respiratory pandemic for years.

Here's the 2015 video where Gates explains that the likelihood of a serious global pandemic in his lifetime is over 50%: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AEMKudv5p0

Here's his TED talk in 2015 warning us that we aren't ready: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Af6b_wyiwIExactly this.  As well, for months it spread from China, through Europe and we in North America still didn't prepare properly with all that warning.  Pure incompetence.Gates even gave a TED talk that predicted this with frightening accuracy in 2015. I believe this is partially why the Obama team had a pandemic response team and information put together before he left office.> Some people, including Bill Gates

HE GONNA CHIP YOU ALL WITH HIS DEADLY VACCINE

/sThere's a difference between seeing a possibility of something happening and predicting it. Say if you said our financial system is fragile and market valuations are high, if the market crashed 2 years later, I wouldn't consider that as you predicted it.Depends on what "this" means here. I'm a layman with respect to biology and viruses, but just a little internet surfing told me that we were overdue for a respiratory illness of global proportions. Even mr nobody (me) definitely understood it could happen. 1918 was not a one-time event; it was at least a once-in-a-century bug that would probably become more and more likely to reoccur with the increase in livestock and chicken farming, etc.

But knowing what it really might look like? Nope, I didn't have a clue. Mass unemployment? Business shut downs? Full scale economic fallout? I could have told you it would probably *affect* the economy, but I couldn't have told you the scale or magnitude.

Just thoughts.The people in power had a responsibility to expect this and plan for it and execute on that plan.

But OP was talking about the people making 10 an hour in fields that don't exist anymorethe naysayers always looks so smart because when theyre wrong people ignore them, when theyre right they sound like geniuses.

Just like those people who who the stock market is going to crash every year. year after year.[removed]I was going to say it was obviously sarcasm, then I remembered what sub I was in.Yeah, remember when everybody was out trying to get masks and the top experts at the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  and the CDC came out and told us all that masks weren’t needed and the only people that should wear masks were people with active signs of sickness and those taking care of them as they weren’t necessary or helpful for healthy people.  Then they came out months later and said, that in fact masks did help, but they didn’t want people buying and hoarding them so that there was enough left over for essential workers.  It’s almost like they hid the scientific facts from us and told us the opposite thing in order to service  a government agenda, and then get upset when people don’t trust scientists to give us honest truth and facts without a hidden agenda.

Not to mention the World Health Organization praising China for their transparency and openess and the wonderful job they were doing to control the virus....followed by calling the US raceist for closing its boarders to Travellers from China.

It’s like we all forget that we were trying to shut down and wear masks until the scientific community fucked it up.[removed]Yes, those people are in my immediate circle of friends.

I’m kicking it my friend’s place right now who tried to get fired after the pandemic assistance was announced. She figured if she could collect $4k/mo without working, why not. Unfortunately for her she couldn’t get herself fired because her job was and is short people.I quit in June due to having to move and they said I couldn't do the same job at home from another state. So I filed for unemployment and am getting great money doing nothing now while quarantined in Hawaii. I had been doing the same IT job at home for covid and could do it anywhere in the world. But they said no not in hawaii. So now I'm sitting here saving money for doing nothing. Luckily we have family here for a free place to stay.It’s because of those damned Zonies that want to come to our beaches spreading that Zonie virus.Also seasonal adjustmentsI'm wondering how if it will drop in the coming weeks. I know atleast for myself and some friends, our managers brought us back only PT so we can still claim the $600. Returning to FT work next week.Covid spikes in the three most populous states in the US too: California, Texas, Florida. That's more than 1/4th of the US population, so it obviously has a big impact on overall numbers. Luckily a few of those are giving indicators they have peaked.If that was the case why are continuing claims down?This is such a patently untrue statement.

In order to continue to receive benefits, you normally have to show that you are making an effort to find a job, and you cannot turn down a job that is close in salary to your previous salary. This means showing proof of resumes sent and applications filled out, and the states do check on these because they don't want to be paying unemployment. 

So in reality, people who were already receiving low wages and have been forced to apply to places like Walmart for work just to meet the requirements to continue to receive unemployment have probably been offered positions since major chain retailers have continued to hire during these times. Should they not accept, they lose the benefits.

You don't get to just lounge around the house and hit the beach while on unemployment. I don't know why so many people have this idea in their heads, but it needs to stop being spread because it's completely detached from the reality of the situation.If you turn down a job on unemployment, the employer can report you and you can lose all benefits.

Also, people tend to take the safe route. A job is consistent and unemployment runs out. So most people who can work, take the job rather than staying on unemployment.

There may be a few bad apples gaming the system, but the majority of people don't do that. 

The Republican talking point "unemployment causes people to not want to work" isn't backed up by evidence.White collar worker jobs are getting ready to get axed. Companies are going to start looking at downsizing soon. That’s when most Americans will wake up. Nike just announced its going to be laying people off. This is what the next quarter will be about in my opinion, which in this market is just as good as the next guys.What industry out of curiosity ?For some of them, their new role might be "homeless," "criminal," etc.More than half. In my state you’re awarded 120-275 a week plus the 600 pua pay. It’s going to be a big dip due to people going from a monthly income of $2880-$3500 to $480- $1100 where that’s not even half of most peoples rent.So how is 16 million continuing on government assistance bullish?[removed]Here's the breakdown.

I think 26 is average.  I must have divided by two because I was thinking paychecks.I understand that. What I don’t get is stock markets or people in general comparing these monthly jobless claims to indicate whether things are getting better or not. They’re not. Total unemployed since March is a bigger picture rather than rate.Yeah even that article wasn't straight forward.Uh-huh. It couldn't be that people on continuing claims found jobs - it must just mean that unemployment is running out!

The problem is we know how many claims are coming from each state and we know what each state has for UI claim limits. Guess what? When you do the math, almost no one has been on UI long enough yet for the benefits to expire. Try again!🐑🐑Its not my fault I went to college and got a job with some job security even if I had lost my job I woulda found two more to replace it because Im not a lazy system sucking leech. Adapt and survive or keep cashing your unemployment sheep just stop acting like you have it tough or deserve more. There are jobs out there plenty!And why would that happen before even the $600 ended?I'm from the UK so I'm not that familiar with the US system. I understand that the $600 benefit ends this month, although I don't think that's what we're talking about here. Can you not claim unemployment benefit indefinitely if you're actively looking for a job?

In the UK you just have to "prove" you're looking for work and you'll be entitled to job seekers allowance. I guess it's different in the US?You can claim unemployment until December 31 2020 because of the CARES act.

No one is ending their claims this year unless they got a job.To be fair, this is an accurate statement regardless of pandemic.username checks out.In the US, it is sometimes used as well. "His business is sound."What does being a 'top bloke' mean?in America it just means he won't rape you.My October gig is planned as a virtual meeting for Home Depot.I feel for you. My family owns a catering business that’s been around for nearly 60 years. This is ruining us.The time for the federal government to "do something" was in March when mask mandates and nationwide stay at home orders were needed. We're now stuck in their shitty loop of denial, with nothing but, "everything's fine, do what you want, open up" coming from Washington, while cases are still spiking in several regions and there is an uncoordinated response on a state by state level.

Those benefits end this week actually.   


There is no sight of a new round being sent out either.Mexico, because it’s so dependent on low value manufacturing and tourism, hasn’t had the luxury of being able to shut down like the US. 

We may have to eventually end up in their situation, just grinding it out until the virus kills everyone it would have killed.Damn, he's been planting the seeds for his microchip vaccine master plan for 5 whole years. Also spending billions on eliminating malaria and finding solutions to clean water for the past decade or so was just a ruse. Guy is an evil genius!You are correct. Many experts predicted a pandemic from China at some point. The  only thing really different is COVID’s lethality  (thank god), although there’s still plenty of time for the US to give it a run for its money...Your submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

They have been getting axed. Lots of engineering positions at various places up and down silicon valley have already been cut.I wonder if some tech heavy businesses that can mostly or fully WFH will look into closing their offices before laying anyone off.LinkedInNothing in Financial services however. Still very strong, especially bankingMore likely is companies scale up remote work and downsize their overhead spending on office space. Sure some white collar jobs will get cut, and not all white collar jobs can be done fully remotely, but at this point a lot of businesses are looking at the rent payments they're making for cubicles people are not sitting in.  Some companies would come out ahead even if they have to break lease contracts.  Not all will go t 100% remote work require, but many companies could reduce he # of floors they lease and focus on creating touchdown work stations and meeting/collaboration rooms for folks that need the in-person experience for a project.Most businesses are announce 5% reductions in work forces. I don’t think it’s THAT big.Software/IT 

Lots of furlough/layoffs in IT, like in any recession.

IT markets are more accurately assessed by looking at markets served. So if youre in IT and serve medical, legal, etc, youre busier than ever. If retail or hospitality, youre hosed.

Communities are full of job search posts as well as new businesses being created by laid off internal IT ppl.

Also, plenty of layoffs and furloughs in fintech (anecdotally, most of my neighbors and friends work in fintech).

And I wouldnt call most of it part of "creative destruction," and the parts that are in that category are still destructive and happened over a very short amount of time compared to such instances not fueled by a pandemic.

https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/06/11/unemployment-rose-higher-in-three-months-of-covid-19-than-it-did-in-two-years-of-the-great-recession/

The debate around reportable figures for unemployment also add to the vaguery of assessing impact.

They broke it down by education, which isnt very helpful since menial, low skill jobs can require a bachelor's.

It would be great to see a report on employment based on income.

My neighbors and friends were all earning 100k and being out of work is rather foreign to them all (good workers).

The impact is always greater the lower on the socioeconomic scale you go, but the expectation is that we are still shifting and adjusting and white collar jobs have not yet seen the peak of losses both to the shift still being in progress and the debate of the segmentations.Well on the cynical side, it's a simulation of a population that now actually has a living wage.  So that's bullish until the sim stops or burns out.Those 16 million people are still spending money, whether they got it from the remaining taxpayers, or from a job. This is bullish for larger companies that dominate the market.Your submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

What it said, in useful terms:

Claims from people already on unemployment dropped, meaning they went back to work or just stopped claiming for whatever reason. This number is less than expected, which should be good.

New claims from people just laid off are up about 100,000. This number is more than expected, which may be bad.

* all numbers are probably massaged, ymmv...> The problem is we know how many claims are coming from each state and we know what each state has for UI claim limits. Guess what? When you do the math, almost no one has been on UI long enough yet for the benefits to expire. Try again!

I guess you're assuming no one was on unemployment before covid hit and the CARES act was passed.Lol your college education hasnt done much for you. Clearly you must have cheated your way to a degree. Only the braindead and boomers think like you. It's a shame the Rona hasn't taken your life.they died of COVID so could no longer fileSome people are running out and get dropped before they get the extended thing approvedNo our unemployemnt runs out after approx 26 weeks. It's been extended another 13 weeks ontop of that then it runs out again.No. The unemployment system is run by the States. Each state is different. It only lasts a specific number of weeks, then you are SOL. However, during recessions, the Federal government comes in and pays for extensions of benefits. But, if you are already off the unemployment rolls you are still SOL. The system is designed as a small bridge to new employment, that is paid into by employers. It's not a welfare system. Well, until the Federal government steps in and just pours in borrowed money.

/sIt varies from state to state, with the Republican states usually having the worst policies. For example, in my shithole of Missouri, your maximum weekly benefit is $320 which is less than a minimum wage job. Missouri also only provides it for 20 weeks.I obviously haven't read the cares act, but I was under the impression that it gave states the OPTION of extending benefits to 39 weeks (rather than the typical 26). If that's right, then I can guess which states chose not to extend them. 

If you're right, and every state was forced to extend, then maybe this person was already on unemployment beforehand? 

Either way there is a limit on how long you can claim unemploymentDoesn't PUA, part time, self employed and contractors, run out for most people this week, and a few states last week??Do you have a source on that? From what I’ve seen, it’s only the lengths of benefits being extended.What happens Jan 1 is you still don't have a job?

Jobless claims for the month definitely seem like they should be pretty bad when they come out next month, but I bet they're going to have a signed stimulus not long after you see the market impact from that (at this rate the day that comes out might well be your first day that goes -300 to -500 on the DOW minimum in what at least feels like a long time).

We tried that it was called the Great Depression.It's probably the main reason I still have a job (i'm the second highest paid guy in a struggling small company, and I expect to be laid off along with maybe a couple others in the next month once I'm no longer "free".)The senate is releasing a stimulus package plan today. Looks like stimulus checks will be about the same as they were before and they're extending UE benefits but knocking it from $600/wk to $200-400/wk.Actually the WHO changed their guidance about masks much later than the CDC.  They changed their stance on June 5th.  To put that in context of the stupid scale, that’s 9 days after Sean Hannity changed his stance on masks and 45 days before Trump did.[removed]He's not, or if he is, his story is completely false.I got unemployment when I left (quit) the military voluntarilyCan you source that? Am curios as to where you got that information.The CARES Act simply stated that states "should consider" relaxing that requirement, yet most states have not, or have language about returning to work as soon as offered their position back.

I agree with you that we should not be forcing people to go out looking for work during a pandemic. The sad reality is that our government has failed to safeguard both the physical and economic well-being of its people, and the states do not have unlimited funds with which to cover continued unemployment. Nor do many businesses have the ability to remain permanently shuttered during the crisis, so many people are being told to come back when they shouldn't. 

Do you think an employer is going to allow a worker who has been offered their position back to continue to collect benefits?

edit - pdoherty is not wrong, and I've removed my assertion that what they said is incorrect.Yeah I can’t believe anyone thinks they really need to look for a job. You can bullshit those forms so easily. It’s free money.Because can’t you just apply to jobs you know you won’t get?  Like I could apply to CFO roles even though I only have 6 years work experience and I know I won’t get the job.That's great, but Washington state has less than 400,000 currently unemployed. Florida has 1.4 million unemployed and benefits are **capped** at $275 a week for 12 weeks.Anecdotal experience is anecdotal.

I've been on unemployment before, so I know first hand how it works. If you want to go by anecdotal experience, the majority of people I know who applied for unemployment benefits still haven't received them in many states, even after two months of applying and being approved.Cool story. All the people I know collecting the extra UI are actively looking for jobs, including myself. Stop making generalizations. Thanks.My company is tech-adjacent and we've basically sold our office to go full remote. I think even non-tech heavy businesses could as well. 

The challenge though is that remote work is very different from in-office work. Side conversations and other organic forms of communication don't happen the same way, so you need to be much more deliberate about how you're communicating and organized.

Also, most successful remote companies I know of focus on working asynchronously, which I think is a hard thing to get used to from a management perspective when you're used to working synchronously.From what I've been reading, it looks like there's a consensus forming that businesses can do without, at least for a while. Seems like they're saying "por que no los dos?"JP Morgan is hiring like COVID never happened. So are we, but I won't say where.5% of "most businesses" is a *lot* of people!IT != software

I think IT is probably being affected because a lot of other staff just isn’t on site and it’s not like IT is going to make house call for tech issues and it’s not like companies are in a rush to make big infrastructure changes so the demands not thereBut... it's being financed by debt and doesn't result in any production or service.  It doesn't reflect any increase in economic activity.   It's just a sunk cost.   Bullish would be if people were returning to work in any significant numbers (which they are not)I'm 1000% baffled by price action in the marketCorporate development. The main issue I found was everyone wanted someone with a financial due diligence background but almost all companies weren’t willing to fork out the value you’re worth.Yeah.Any idea what might be causing it?  I hate to sound paranoid, but it really does look like there might be some credence to the idea of the Plunge Protection Team.Makes sense. Maybe my bet saying cruise lines and the general market will start regaining some ground...hard to believe Im down so much saying cruise lines will lose money when they haven't had passengers in months and won't until at least October 1. Who the hell is propping those cesspool up?Coming from someone most definitely living in moms basement that has absolutely nothing and done absolutely nothing and will do absolutely nothing. Oh but at least your a feeble minded sheep and “think” like the mainstream tells you you should. 🐑🐑🐑🤡🤡🤡thanks for making my pointThat may or may not account for a few thousandTechnically, states had the option to extend the unemployment benefits for a further 13 weeks, but a good amount haven't.Just wow. I don't even get the logic here. If you have been unemployed long enough, the government essentially just discards you to the streets?So is this 26 weeks for lifetime? Or just for one period of unemployment like say, i face unemployment 2 times over 5 years do I collectively get 26 weeks or do I actually get 52 - 26 per period.Sounds like a Trump quote to meI can't vouch for the site, but some google searching found this: https://www.cbpp.org/research/economy/policy-basics-how-many-weeks-of-unemployment-compensation-are-available

Looks like the extra 13 weeks applies a lot of places.The end of July is the current end date of PUA.  Some hypothetical lazy bastard can file after the deadline for unemployed weeks that occurred before July 31st and get a retroactive benefit for the weeks that occurred before July 31 but thats it.  Congress would have to pass a new bill and trump would have to sign it for any additional money.Hopefully by Jan 1 that gives the government enough time to set up massive tent cities and stock up on MREs.Where do you get it now? You move in with friends or relatives or you become one of them 600,000 homeless people. The average household size in the U.S. is only 2.6 people. There is plenty of room to absorb people. Only places like South America, Africa, & Asia are average households at 3-6+ people.He is in the sound business, but his business is not sound.  How’s that?Did you checked? How do you know his lad is swelled?No one would say "swell lad".I feel you. The sentiments are shared client and vendor-side. I’m not convinced the trend will continue - there’s so much screen fatigue, and I think event directors will soon be under pressure to prove that virtual events are a worthwhile investment.

But it’s hard... when I’m working a live event the energy is entirely different. You pull all nighters, you make sure your tech rehearsals are flawless. You plan for redundancy, etc. With virtual, it’s just another screen.We STILL do not have a national mask mandate or any other coordinated response to stop the virus (as every other civilized nation has done). This falls squarely on the denier-in-chief and his continued anti-science stance.


But nice deflection attempt.> Yeah I'd be really surprised if we don't get more stimulus soon

Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell stated no for stimulus packages (as of a few days ago).Don't impose on my freedom to kill you with a virus you selfish bastard.> Just keep printing money, what's the worst that could happen?

A fellow fan of MMT I see.

(Also /s)Speaking only for myself: The stock market should be allowed to move freely up **and** down. Even if down means WAY down. 

The whole point is that investors (usually the rich in a society) are taking on extra risk (vs a bond) in exchange for extra (potential) reward. 

If that system can be bailed out by borrowing, which essentially sends it on to the working class, then the whole system is broken. The rich get all the potential reward with much less of the risk, and the working class just gets fucked.That is good news! The articles I was reading a couple days ago seemed like there was a big gridlock on the issue.Oh thanks for correcting me! That’s also insane. Although, I guess that’s less of an indicator of something bad going on and possibly just science taking place and we update shit as we learn about it.[removed]I am getting unemployment, and I did end the job myself. I told them that I would like to continue working from home in another state. They declined and I ended my employment in mid June. I can prove it if you want a DM I'll show the unemployment deposit from this week.How? Was this pre Covid? Also didn’t you know you could just quit the military! Husband is in and hates itAnd weirdly enough, this is the moment conversations such as this suddenly come to an end

How strangeOur state is not requiring proof of seeking work. They just ask have you denied a job offer.

It is also not a good idea to overestimate the willingness of employers to tell the UI office on people. Restaurant industry is shady as is, I do not see them turning people in, especially when the governor said do not go to work if you are afraid to do so.What are you saying I said isn’t true?  I didn’t even mention the CARES Act.No idea my man. I’ve never applied for unemployment, but from what I recall my friend telling me is that he would just list random employers even though he may not have actually applied; again, from what I recall HIM telling me. I’ve never applied for unemployment and I’m sure the process is different for each state>That's great, but Washington state has less than 400,000 currently unemployed.

I love how you pivoted there.  First your argument was that you must actively seek employment else not collect the benefits.  That is not a correct statement.  To use your wording what you said was "patently untrue."

Now your argument is that since Washington state has fewer unemployed people than another state it somehow doesn't count.

You deserve a gold medal for mental gymnastics today!> I've been on unemployment before,

Have you been on it during a global pandemic? When unemployment levels are at their highest in recent history? Do you *really* think that they have the resources and manpower to verify that tens of millions of people are applying for jobs, and moreover, applying for jobs they actually qualify for, putting real effort into their resume, etc.
>I've been on unemployment before, so I know first hand how it works. If you want to go by anecdotal experience, the majority of people I know who applied for unemployment benefits still haven't received them in many states, even after two months of applying and being approved.
  
  
Because this isn't normal. There's barely enough people working to hand out benefits to the people you know...but There's enough people to make sure others are searching for work? No.Reading comprehension. Try using. Thanks.CITI..Amazon has hired more than 50,000 people here in India in the last few months and more there are more than 20,000 openings right now at Amazon India.The new paradigm is that printing money itself creates goods and services. Have you not seen the cultural shift in the understanding of money? Just print and the goods will follow.PRICED INThanks. That is where I am considering heading down the road. Sounds more appealing than the fp&a route> Who the hell is propping those cesspool up?

If I knew the answer to that question and how to use it, I'd be a rich bear.Simple-minded bitchWhat in the braindead? In the 1st response I said I bought a house hahahha.  I'm losing IQ points everytime I read and respond to you. I'm done now. Have a blessed day. Hopefully you jump off a chair.I was joking, but in all seriousness, the death counts are off by quite a bit, there are quite a few people who never seek hospitalization (because the costs are batshit insane) and end up dying at home without ever being testedRight and they're going to let the Federal government cover those extra 13 weeks instead of the States kicking in their own portion.Most states do have a longer periodYou apply for section 8 housing and food stamps at that point.It's not a welfare benefit. It's an unemployment system that employers pay into, and there's a certain finite benefit you receive. It's not a free lunch.

The concept is, if you don't find a job within a certain number of weeks, then you don't really want one. Which they eventually don't report you on that unemployment figure as unemployed anymore. That unemployment number are just people who are considered "actively looking" for work.There's probably some difference depending on your state. But in my state, if you use the full 26 weeks, then you have to work for another 26 weeks before you can be eligible again.Each state varies. You basically have to work a certain number of weeks to qualify for getting it again. It's no free ride. Well, until the Federal government comes in and pours in free money.He prefers people who don't ~~get captured~~ lose their jobs.Sounds like the sound business isn't always a sound business.His business is sound.  His business isn't sound.Left anterior descending artery? I'm not a doctor, but I think they check that by an angiogram.That's just swell, lad.I believe you are moving the goalposts here, and it is you who is deflecting. We were discussing people out of a job who are struggling to make ends meet.. not the pandemic. I agree the two are related, but other countries with national mask mandates also have industries that were destroyed. However, their versions of congress passed laws that supported the individuals who were effected instead of big companies--look at france and its UBIAs of this morning they're debating a short-term extension of the enhanced benefits because they can't find consensus among republicans. Mitch wants UE to be 70% of a pay check, Mnuchin wants 100%He can disagree with it until he's blue in the face, but he's going to lose to what the vast majority of even GOPs think (although they don't agree with the 3 trillion that's been proposed by the House, they do agree with some form of 1 more stimulus).

Even if they don't look good on getting one done before the month ends, if we were to see the market truly slide, Trump's going to nudge people into changing their minds shortly after that.I mean, the stock market is allowed to move freely. The entire premise that it isn't is a reddit meme devoid of any actual evidence. The reality is that reddit simply doesn't like it when the markets move in the directions it didn't predict.It’s actually just a bigger hit against the WHO.  If the CDC was trying to influence people to not wear masks to protect the US mask supply...the WHO was downplaying the coronavirus to not make China look bad.  They praised China’s response and parroted the Chinese misinformation....actually sometimes releasing “new information” about the virus that was actually just sent to them by the Chinese government.  

I honestly don’t expect much from our politicians when things like this happen.  It’s a big ugly mess even at the best of times.  However, the real danger is the fact that our scientific community isn’t up in arms about how these global scientific leaders have lied and manipulated while playing politics.  Our scientific leaders should never get away with withholding facts or obscuring truth.  If they start down that path, how do we trust our scientists any more than we trust our politicians...and that is a really really scary thought.  Its crazy to me that this all happened so recently and we have already forgotten that the scientific community that we trusted actually were major players in this going badly and not some benevolent source of hope that would have saved us if we had just listened to them.[removed]I would be careful if I was you. All claims are getting automatically approved right now. When they start doing audits, they might ask for the money back because typically you will not receive unemployment if you quit. Unless your previous employer just didn’t care and approved the claim.Actually right during Covid. I was an officer and I had completed my initial obligation, so I was free to request a release from active duty at any time. If you’d husband is enlisted he’ll have to wait until the end of his contractYeah it really pisses me off people can so calmly make shit up and just say it as if its true without sourcing it.Employers pay your unemployment through taxes, so it absolutely benefits them to report cases of people turning down work, especially those who have been asked to come back to work.You're right, it's not that you're wrong, but that not all states are waiving that requirement. Sorry for wording my response incorrectly.I’m sure the agency could follow up and check if he did apply but so many people are on unemployment they can’t audit everyone.  I am thinking that you could hands down apply to jobs you know you won’t get just to keep collecting unemployment.  I personally have no issues with people taking advantage of the system right now anyway.  It’s better that people stay home.I pivoted yet you mentioned the situation in one state while ignoring the other 49? If one of us is doing mental gymnastics, it's you.During a pandemic no, but I lost my job in finance in the 2008 crash so while not exactly the same, it's the most similar event in many of our lifetimes.

As far as manpower yes, and it is for a similar reason the IRS audits lower income people more than they do the rich. The states do not want to continue to pay benefits. Full stop. Most states don't even offer a "reasonable" level of unemployment assistance regardless of the salary you were making before you became unemployed.

These systems, especially in certain places, are designed to frustrate you enough to give up on the benefits because the struggle and anger and anxiety you have to go through to get them is mind boggling. A system like Florida's is a perfect example. They spend more time monitoring people who are on assistance than they do processing new claims for a reason.The systems are working as intended. Many unemployment systems are intentionally designed to frustrate people away from using them, and the systems use more resources to kick people out of the system than they do processing new applicants into the system.Yes i have seen it.  Whether it is accurate or sustainable, though........Only thing I will warn of is be careful of the Company. I know some people in my network who took the same route and work more then they did in public accounting.I got 20+ years to retirement Im more of a very fuzzy bull. Looking 10+ years yeah Im bullish. Next 1-2 years very not. That and paper hands is killing me. Buy Amazon call, set sell order at 100% because easy math. Realize if it goes to 160% I make all my trading losses back and start eating into my long term loss on Ford. Move limit order. Next day position jumps from 30% gain to 102% Day 3 falls to 40%. I cash out and it keeps going lower. Had I left the original limit Id have added $11,000 to my account. 

Buys 2 shares of TSLA on 6/23 chickens out sells an hour later for a small loss. A week later buys 45 shares of TSLA 20% higher. Chickens the fuck out again. Buys a TSLA 1800C for October $6900  Gaps down. Sells at $5700 a 20% loss. 

Basically if I'd left well enough alone the first time. 

Amazon Call: +11k. 2 Tesla Shares: +50% ($1000 profit.) Tesla call cost: 6900 sell for up to $12,500. Likely would have cashed out before earnings. 

The TSLA 2 TSLA shares I bought around $1007. The 45 shares I bought around $1212. The 2 shares would have only added about $1200 to my investments at 1600/share but that's a 60% gain

The 45 shares would have earned me about 40%. But that would have been like 28k and if my numbers are right plenty to make up for losses. 

I didn't have the money to make all the moves at the same time. I could do the block of Tesla shares or the Options contracts on Amazon and Tesla but not all three. The Amazon sell order at 100% would have made me about $16400 I made $5000

Tesla shares at 1212 sold at 1455 would have made me about 10k. 

The 2 options plays would have made me about 15k total. Instead of about $5000 total.

Workhorse cost me a lot. If all had gone well. I'd have made about 27k and not lost about $15k so my accounts would have been in much better shape. Sadly the unrealized gains hurt emotionally. The realized losses hurt walletly.Lol sick burn “jump of a chair”those show up as excess deaths by another cause a few weeks down the line.

It's that excess death data that made Fauci say USA is probably severely underestimating deaths from this (including deaths caused indirectly like postponed surgery or undiagnosed/untreated illness)It really is true.. One of my coworkers who was laid off with me and collecting unemployment ended up passing away last month. He’s one of the ones no longer continuing their claim but it’s because he’s not alive anymore, not because he found a job 😢This guy soundsHis sound business isn’t.pic it or it didn't happenedA reduction over time would probably be best. 70% for August and September, then maybe 25% for October-December.

If nothing happens, it's going to be brutal next month.[removed]Ahh okay I was thinking you quit mid contract lol. Yep we’re waiting for that day... 2.5 more years!The federal relief isn't included in state UI taxes. It might benefit them to report people but that doesn't mean they will by any means.“Finesse or get finessed”. I don’t have a problem with people taking advantage of it either. I just don’t understand how some people think that people aren’t. 

How do people/the wealthy build wealth? By taking advantage of opportunities when they’re offered. A lot of PPP went to companies that didn’t really need it but if they’re eligible why not apply? Anyone and their mother could’ve applied and got a PPP loan; wether you went through the right bank is a different story. Banks want to give PPP loans: Guaranteed by SBA and get fees for originating them. Banks don’t have shit to lose on PPP.>I pivoted yet you mentioned the situation in one state while ignoring the other 49? If one of us is doing mental gymnastics, it's you.

You made an assertion.  I proved it wrong by providing an example.  I don't need to prove it wrong 50 times over for my point to be valid.Auditing people’s taxes is relatively easy and can be somewhat automated, versus monitoring people to make sure they’re actually applying for jobs. And even if they are, it takes real serious manpower to verify that they’re actually putting effort into their applications as opposed to purposefully bungling themI'm sure you have a source for this statement you just pulled out of thin air to help your argument. Just to be safe i won't be holding my breath.That would be unfortunate, hopefully they have really good comp. Appreciate the adviceI've been watching WKHS because they're kinda-local to me. It's been a wild ride with that one.hol upDepends on how long shut downs to continue. If states are still in the middle of shutdowns (i.e. actively don't want people returning to work), people shouldn't be returning to work and the enhanced benefits should continue for rent assistance and demand stimulusYour submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

https://www.wesh.com/article/florida-unemployment-problems-desantis/32771429#Yeah I heard about it from Reddit. My dad's about to retire as a broker/advisor. I talked to him about the pandemic like March 1. He told me just hold on to everything but I wanted a reason to sell a few things like BAC Id held it for like 15 years and was profitable but it hasn't been for so long like 2008-2016. I figured if the economy halts banks are tumbling so sell BAC take profits and in a month consider buying back into it or spending the money elsewhere. Then we went into work from home. 

Work from home gave me less to do my sales and savings left me with money on the sidelines. I tried options and apparently lost a lot over time.

Heard about them on Reddit. Considered dropping a couple grand on options. Got nervous. Bought 3 instead of like 12. That was Monday morning. I sold. Thursday morning for +100%. Turned $1800 into $3400 quick. At that point I was down about $6000. A lot of money but compared to all my investments just a couple percent. 

They'd been going up like crazy for weeks. I figured if I go big like a 15-20% move would get me my 8k back and I'd cash out then start looking for long term stocks to add to my portfolio for the next 25-40 years. They moved 20% down. The hole in my account just went from 8k to 20k plus.

Most of the stocks I sold off have not recovered so Id could buy them back cheaper. Trading hurt me more than just holding would have by a long shotThat didnt sound right?Wait a minuteIt's certainly contingent on a multitude of factors including how badly the state in question is doing.

Best case scenario slowly reducing the benefit would give people a kick in the butt to start looking or go back to existing jobs. Of course that isn't going to happen if there are no jobs to return to.Did you even read your own sources? There's nothing in there that says "they use more resources to kick people off".

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*This is such a strange time.  My company is making more money than it ever has and since I have a commission based salary so am I.  Without anything to really spend my extra money on I am buying stocks.  I wonder how many people are doing the same.to borrow a line: Econometricians, they're ever so pious.  But are they doing real science or confirming their bias?Making out-of-sample predictions is hard, non-linearity is a sunovabitch, etc etc.

Unless you really want to dig into both models and evaluate their methodology, best to just ignore it. Go by the consensus estimate here:

[https://www.frbatlanta.org/-/media/images/cqer/research/gdpnow/gdpnow-forecast-evolution.gif?h=483&w=912&la=en](https://www.frbatlanta.org/-/media/images/cqer/research/gdpnow/gdpnow-forecast-evolution.gif?h=483&w=912&la=en)This is a completely new situation. No model is going to estimate well, because no model in use today has been in a global pandemic of this type. It's almost pointless, vs just watch and see what happens.Predictions are difficult when hard-to-model shocks are acting upon the system.Either way, both predictions are up significantly from the earlier lows.  The market has priced that in.  By any measure, employment rates exceeded expectations.  Meanwhile, studies show that those on unemployment are still contributing significantly to the economy due to spending that is supported by the $600 weekly unemployment bonus.

You can see from New York's Q1 and 2019Q4 "nowcasts" that it tends to be much more conservative in changes (in either direction) than other forecasts.  The preliminary Q3 estimate is similarly conservative.so should i buy more stocks now or wait two weeksCalling it now, it’ll be -24.5%

For that guy who comes back to this post to say “wtf are you Nostradamus?”

yes.this is why Warren Buffett didn't buy the dip... because no one knows what's coming next... could be bad, could be worse, could be utter catastropheActual GDP will be only -4.35%. Markets will fly. What a rigged fucking game.Anyone out there buying volatility ETNs in anticipation of this future news and all the other factors?Can you please tell me which months consist of each quarter?It'll be more than 2 weeks before all the revisions are done.Can confirm. Company I own is atm making insane money and thus putting it into the market because....well inflation on the horizon matey.[removed][removed]RemindMe! 2 weeksI think what you can take from this, is that growth slowed.That us why economics is a pseudo science.
A bunch of monkeys throwing darts in the dark.[removed]Same data source, vastly different predictions from different models. It just shows huge uncertainty. In other word, nobody knows anything.All this post did was remind me of the news. No doubt, you got me to click, But, right after I saw how this DOES NOT MATTER.This just illustrates how completely useless and utterly incapable of prediction the "scientific" econometric models are.Actually it's pretty common for them to have a large divergence. I could explain it to you, but I don't want to wear out my keyboard for no result.This sub is probably the worst sample group, after all we wouldn't be here if we didn't have disposable income to invest.

Things have been pretty rough for a lot of people I know. I live in the UK, so again, probably not the best sample group, but I know several people who have lost their jobs over the last few months as a direct result of COVID-19. Others are unsure how long they'll have a job given how many businesses are struggling at the moment -- myself included.

From what I've seen stimulus measures have done a pretty good job at offsetting the consequences of mass unemployment, but that isn't going to last forever. I think we may see a strong initial recovery only for it to stall out later this year.

COVID-19 certainly hasn't been a positive for the vast majority of businesses or people.I'm a corporate attorney, transactional work.

Somehow I'm not just doing well, I'm blowing out the KPI from the start of the year. Clients are engaged, keeping me busy, and cruising along.Raises hand. I work in the liquor industry, everyday is a new high. Buying as much stock and ITM options with far out expiry as I can.I'm also making significantly more money this year, but really I have no idea what to do with my extra after tax income right now.  I would typically just stuff it away in my ETF index funds, but this market doesn't make any sense to me and I'm sticking on the sidelines for now in cash.  I'll re-evaluate this fall once the additional unemployment really takes its course AND more of the quarterly financial reports come out.Loads of people who are middle and upper class. I'm middle class and no one I know has lost their job.

Many of the people who are unemployed were lower paid workers who never had spare money to invest in stocks anyway.

The rich get richer. The wealth gap increases.

I'm on the right side of it, but it seems wrong. I'm glad my government (Ireland) is supporting those who are unemployed via my taxes.https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/employment-by-major-industry-sector.htm

110-120 million jobs in the US are in the non-specialized service industry, and less than 15 million in professional services.  You are definitely an outlier as around half of American households even with the $600 a week boost in unemployment have lost wealth during this time.My SaaS business has seen insane growth in subscriptions since COVID started. All the metrics, from acquisition to engagement to retention, have been way up. I doubled my revenue goal for this year because in a few weeks I'll be hitting my original goal for the end of the year.

Hired 2 new employees to handle the increase in support volume, as well as doubled my spend on CPC advertising which is working out great. Have seen increased competition for my terms as well, the ad market is more competitive than ever. 

Longing GOOGL and FB. The coronavirus is the best thing to happen to tech companies.Does your company make PPE?Same.People have reduced expenses. That summer camp that one sends their kids that costs 2-4k a kid, and say you have 4 kids, you basically saved about 10k, less buying lunches and dinners, more thousands saved. Less travel(save on gas and maintenance, or public transit, even more savings), and less starbucks. All these add up.

Most of my family and friends have kept their jobs, but have been spending way less. Add the stimulus and most consumers have more liquid cash then ever.I've stayed the course and still have an extra 10k sitting in the bank. My spending has dipped like crazy and I don't see it going back up anytime soon.  A handful of my friends have begun to travel throughout and outside the state to continue their pre corona lifestyle.This - my biotech company is off to it's best start in it's 90+ history... End of year bonuses will probably be 200% of our targetYou in the packaged food industry or something?Car industry...we had the best month in the last two decades we arent  selling more cars but gross  on each car is bigger than ever.What does your company do or what industry are they? I assume you're in sales?What industry do you work inI'm in an identical position as well.  I and most of my other friends who have retail businesses are experiencing record sales.Buying stocks is probably the last thing I'd do at this moment.

We are seasonally headed for a pullback.

Prices have gone up since spx 2800 nonstop for 2 months (since May) without closing some gaps below 2900 even as prices headed down to 2900 in June.  This was indicating bullish behavior then, but seasonally, June was not the time for such strong pullbacks, so it made sense to hold or add more.  Now in July...not so much.

Watch here.  About 2min in.
https://youtu.be/RugCIVyc6qI

IMO, if the market rises next week or so, the SPX is headed for 3250-3300, then a pullback of 400pts or more.  The Nasdaq has already paused and not going to new highs.  Sector rotation is happening where winners are being sold at tops for laggards in the s&p, iwm, transports, and financials.

Then after the pullback, maybe back to 3300 after the election or santa rally.

Note that the pullback of 400 pts does not have to happen in July/August.  Probably to 3000, then a bounce to 3150, then down in late Sept/early October before the Fed meeting.  Lastly, flat before the election, and then back to 3300 thereafter.They do what they can with the data they have, which is often limited. That said, in any field there's bound to be some quacks, and attention seekers.From the fight of the century https://youtu.be/GTQnarzmTOcIs this from random walk down wall street ?Agreed, but to build on what you're saying, don't the regional fed banks tend to specifically study the effects on their specific regional markets, sectors and industries?

I wonder what the St Louis and SF feds projections will be...Yeah. I mean they can predict gdp decline with people out of a job, but it’s near impossible to predict with people working at home and schools closed. I fear they will considerably under predict the effect of schools closing. I seriously doubt everybody at home is producing the same.It's not based on the feelings of analysts. Their model just gathers actual data about home starts, retail sales, factory output, etc and weights them to determine their impact on that quarter's GDP. As new data becomes available throughout the quarter their model changes the GDP prediction. It is limited by the quality and completeness of the source data though which because of the pandemic is likely not as good as it has been in the past.not, it's not about models, they don't work and are mostly useless, so are the econometricians who only know to do regressions. They just don't know economic common sense, only regressions and overfitting data for publications.Like the legitimate possibility of trump declaring martial law? What’s happening in Portland is getting biggerThat $600 is gone now.

Edit: there is like 1 payment left. I guess I should have expanded but I'm eating Wendys. Anyway my point is that if the $600 is a big help it won't be in Q3.This is where the U6 unemployment number becomes important. If 1 out of 4 Americans are out of a job, we are going to see a massive reduction in GDP.If anyone here can be 100% sure what to do by predicting the market,they are already filthy rich if they take enough leverage based on the decisionWhat is the correct amount and time frame to short TSLA?Buffett is buy cheap or die tryin’Or it could be fine[removed][removed]Buffets still foolish for not buying in. $SPY sub 2500 is such a glaringly obvious great deal that he should’ve bought into SOMETHINGYou do realize the Fed is taking a single quarter GDP percentage, and extending it out over the entire year, right?

So if you meant it the other way, then your -4.35% is effectively -17.4%, which is between the two predictions.+4.35%, screenshot thisThat seems... impossible.  (The barely negative GDP number, not the market prediction. The market is completely detached from reality right now. Pretty much any prediction is reasonable.)Bought UVXY Friday around $28I got in on UVXY Friday afternoon but SPY has been very very stable the past 3 days as it consolidatesCan we not downvote people for not knowing things and politely asking?

|-|-|-|-|You know i'm not a big fan of QE but I sure like the fact that society if functioning during this pandemic, grocery stores are open and most people still have jobs.  If the economists really sucked things could be way worse.It doesn’t have to have 100% predictive power to be useful."Some government employed economists apply their knowledge to normative positions"

You: tHe WhOlE sCiEnCe iS a sHaM

You my friend are wrong.That’s extremely cynicalI hear those monkeys are good with Shakespeare too.Some people decide to fully capitalize "Fed" for some reason. Like "ROTH" vs "Roth", it's a sticky misunderstanding. ([They don't capitalize it themselves](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed.htm).)I am not surprised that many reddit "investors" do not understand this sarcasm ./r/nihilismI'm in America and I took a small pay cut, but it's not worse so far because my company can't lay anyone off yet because they took bailout money. On October 1st when the bailout provisions expire we are expecting thousands of layoffs, and pay cuts across the board.

Some people are just doing well because the government won't allow them to be laid off. We'll see what happens October 1st.Maybe im bias but where i live job lose hasnt happen and business has been picking up besides dine in restaurants. Tbh its hard to know whats fact and not and looking at these numbers i call bullshit cause it just hasnt affected me a single bit[deleted]Same.  Liquor sales here.  Except I paid off all levels of outstanding debt and beginning to hold cash for now.  At least until oct/nov timeframe I can’t see myself entering the market (besides 401k) in any sizeable way.  I’m likely going to buy a home come jan and take advantage of interest rates; hoping to snag one of these new foreclosures which imo are about to be a plenty.I sell a lot of mixers, like an insane amount of tonic water, ginger bear and club soda.  Easily twice the amount from before lockdown.  It worries me a little about the social impact, but maybe I just stole the business away from the bars and restaurants.I'm afraid of inflation - so my money is in equities and a small position in gold. I suppose my house/mortgage debt is also a small hedge against inflation.Reddit in general is not a representation of the general public. It is a snapshot of the upper middle class.I am in retail, I just planned ahead and picked a recession-proof sector where my pay is directly proportional to how hard I work at a large but poorly run family business where I go unsupervised during my day to day activities.If people are getting $600 a week and are also losing wealth, then maybe they should spend less money a week.

Edit: The hive mind has downvoted me, because they cannot fathom living in their means.I would be extremely surprised if they are up, net. Pure eCom companies have done very well, but all physical stores were hammered. The recent Facebook boycott was nothing but virtue signaling so these companies could cut the spend and improve their profit/loss.

The second the stimulus stops, we’ll see the real pain.Advertising rates are way down, also on adsense. google's biggest cashcow;No. Pocket pussies.No, seltzer and mixers sold in liquor stores, convenience stores, and grocery stores.I think any tech related company is doing well right now.I wish I worked for a biotech company.  I bet you guys make a lot more per unit than I do.SomethingIs that just because you are charging more per car and keeping more profit or is it more complicated?Beverages, I am a salesman so I get about 5% plus expenses and bonuses.BeverageSame, I had the best weeks of my career in terms of sales 5 times during coronavirus.I am bored out of my mind. I don't have anything else to do.fundamentally they think they can predict the future. I suppose to some extent that is possible with some accuracy within certain limited parameters - Ray Dalio hints at in his "Principles" and George Soros does in his "Alchemy of Finance" - but those are not the kind of predictions the fed is making. The fed is making sweeping, grandiose predictions based on models that do not, and cannot, include all the relevant variables.

To borrow another line:

*Those kaynesian models are so tidy and neat, but that top-down approach is a fatal conceit!*> https://youtu.be/GTQnarzmTOc

Either way, we’re in Q3 now.In all likelihood, more stimulus money will come.U-6 was 7.0% in February, 8.7% in March, **22.8% in April, 21.2% in May, and 18.0% in June.**im gonna take it to /r/wallstreetbets to see if they got more info on thisKramer suggests we have two more weeks until the market tanks.

What is the saying - Economist have predicted the last 20 of 5 recessions.Say whatever you want loser. I bet you are either one of those useless economist or aspiring to be one.
 Economist have predicted the last  20 of the 5 recessions.
They are so routinely wrong its laughable.
If a real science was that abysmal nothing would work.
Computers would crash every second ,cars would exploded by the millions.
An Economist is nothing but a glorified guesser.
Like I said monkey and darts.Lol.  Words.And hopefully those people are saving cash for that and not blowing it all with little foresightWe'll see what happens ~~October 1st.~~ one month before the election.

The models that have most successfully predicted the Presidential election are heavily based on how the economy is performing. Trump has also always cared heavily about the economy and market. I think you're going to see some moves to keep it strong even if artificially so. Late November into 2021 may be a different story.I work for a non-profit in the municipal space, and we're doing ok for the moment.  COVID hasn't impacted us in terms of revenue/volume nearly as bad as we were forecasting in April, though it may get bad soon.  That said, there haven't been any layoffs, everyone (except like a dozen critical people) have been working from home, and the company isn't in a rush to go back.

&#x200B;

There haven't been any pay cuts, and we all got our merit increases back in March, and out 2019 incentive payouts in June, though we won't get a 2020 incentive bonus because of cost reductions.  So things are good, for now.Well, we use the numbers to see what is going on. We know they aren’t “bullshit.” There is just a ton of uncertainty right now.

So be thankful that you are doing okay and maybe put a little extra away in case things turn south.You are what's wrong with America "this doesn't impact me so it's clearly false."

You're a short sighted moron.When the pain starts up, so does M&A activity. I wouldn't be shocked if the M&A scene is going gangbusters for the next 18 months, especially in the middle-market.Biglaw destroyed my career before it got a chance to start (pro tip: don't graduate law school in 2010, it won't matter who you work for, your job is doomed and maybe so is the law firm itself). The impact on work availability varies tremendously by type of law practiced. Also, in 2010 it's not just that projects dried up, but clients across the board just balked at the bills and demanded dramatically steep discounts. So firms laid off their entire junior associate classes and replaced the work with contract attorneys that are paid 1/4 the price with no benefits so there is still room for the firm to have attractive PPP metrics.Good for you on the debt. I’m tackling both at the same time solely bc everything is closed and my disposable income that would go to nights out and dinners has been reallocated to outstanding CC debt and the marketDefinitely stealing from the on-premise. They’re down almost 98% across the board. Some states (like WI) however, signed legislation to allow on prem to act like a liquor store and sell their inventory to consumers. Haven’t seen that before which is quite interesting. Also - more and more people are buying higher volume. Wouldn’t be surprised if your liters and bigger sizes are out pacing the smaller 4 and 6 packs. And chain retailers (TGT / WMT / etc...) selling out faster than mom and pop stores.Totally understandable.  I absolutely hate having this much money in a savings account.   Even as a HYSA, I'm only getting 1%. It's very temporary for me, and after a few months we're either buying property or putting it into ETFs.>afraid of inflation

You could look into TIPS. Gov bonds that are adjusted for inflation.Upper middle leftist class*Or they live in a high cost of living area, like most major cities in the US. You know, the places that have been hit hardest by Covid.

I live in Dallas and 600 a week will cover rent, utilities, groceries, and not much else.How much do you think people make? That’s just barely over minimum wage here in California. 

~30 million people are going to be evicted if nothing else changes soonYou were downvoted because you made an obtuse one-size-fits-all assumption about earnings, cost of living, and costs of having a family.

You also completely misunderstood that many states UI offices suck and many people still haven't been able to actually get money despite being qualified for it.Yeah and Facebook CPMs are down 50% YoYThe daycare industry is really hurting. Op is probably trolling.More like peepee eeeeeeee Ammirite?!That makes sense.  I bet the sales are correlated with the Misery Index; were inflation zooming along with the unemployment rate, sales would go to the moon.What industry are you inYou don't have anything else better to do than to buy high and sell low?

Definition of a bad retail investor and stereotypical.  Don't be a stereotype.Oh! In that case, I’d like one large fries, a cherry coke, and one medium fries. If you don’t have cherry coke, then I’ll just have water.that's one more fuckin' week. big whoop.Back at the peak, the nytimes estimated the real unemployment rate at 27%.They will know it when they turn a 10k to 1 M and tgen turn it to -50kA lot of people were saying back in March that August would be a bloodbath for the markets and economy in general. Unemployment runs out and evictions will begin. The economic activity would stop.Have we ever had a gdp decline like that?I just find it odd how confident you are predicting doom and gloom when in the same sentence you even stated no one knows what's coming next.[removed]Yeah lemme give it to him, “buy the dip f**got”Law of big numbers has crippled himHe’s a by the books, fundamentals investor. Obviously he knows what he’s doing, but don’t be fooled- the vast majority of his wealth is from simple buy and hold of indexes/blue chips, growing Berkshire Hathaway, and corporate bailouts where he  gets a stupid amount of equity from a struggling company for dirt cheap. He’s a skilled investor but I think his style and background made him miss big on corona opportunitiesMaybe I'm forgiving because I'm an early years teacher?

How do you measure predictive power? If economists predict GDP will grow 3% and it only grows 2.9% would you say they are wrong? There are way too many variables involved to predict these outcomes with precision. Knowing the variables and their relationships and using them to make predictions that are directionally correct is still useful.

Where does your revenue come from?[deleted]Wrong. PE firms deal flow is down significantly for platform deals.   The debt markets big law guys are busy as companies refinance w the gov low interest loans.It already is. Small businesses closing shop and the middleman is not getting the business in many areas.

For the first time in my life I can actually calculate net worth without liabilities.  What a feeling.Walmart is underperforming compared to grocery stores, both independent and chain. All the independence grocery stores I have did the same day at home shipping for years, while the chains just started. I find my brand does much better when people shop from at home, they go with an old trusted brand instead of something new, and my company is the oldest.Those returns are too low for me to consider having that as a large part of my portfolio. Only expecting mild inflation.Those are slacktavist. But yes this website leans left.

That's around 1000 a week per person plus 1200 stimulus check if you are out of work it could be a lot worse. If you are being totally fucked by this you did 0 planning whatsoever.Been going since on since April. 16 weeks. $9,600 from the boost alone.

The prediction of actual GDP numbers they are almost always wrong.
The point is that if you listen to economist for investing advice you will lose money.
They are just a bunch of momentum chasers and when there is a turn in the economy they never catch it. One good example is 2009. Bernanke famous statement - everything is contained right before the crisis hit the fan.
Then they just print huge sums of money to fix their mistakes.
Btw Weather forecast past 3 days are pretty useless even the weather guys admits to that.GreatYou must have some fascination with assholes.

Small restaurants and retail which had a niche seem to be fine in my city.No. I did that.
ENGINEERING is the way.I was just finally getting back on my feet...I wouldn’t care, except those circumstances destroyed my ability to ever access career track law jobs. It’s like i have lawyer leprosy. Can’t advance within the legal field, cannot get a job outside of law. Every lawyer i meet says “o yeah I remember how my firm totally axed everyone they recently hired with no chance to save their skin and no work to demonstrate their abilities that sucked” but then we are discarded as potential candidates for hire because of that occurrence that everyone remembers out loud as beyond our control and not representative of our potential. I have friends who have killed themselves as they had no opportunities, 6 figures in educational debt for a profession that threw them away, and no way out.If there's no correction and stocks keep going up then yeah you'll obviously get better returns there. If there's another large [correction/recession/depression/crash] then the losses in equities would drown out your dividends instantly.Cool.

Not like they just keep getting money until there is a vaccine and it is widely available and consumer confidence comes back.I mentioned this in another comment, but in Texas it fucking sucks and the absolute maximum you can get is $500. You might only get $70.I mean most big businesses did no planning whatsoever...What a spurious and intellectually flaccid posture to take. This isnt about what people want nor expect, this is about entire industries being decimated and jobs literally evaporating and what the economy *needed* to not further implode. 

Take your self aggrandizement over your work ethic elsewhere, nobody cares.  this is a discussion about the impact of the stimulus ENDING on the GDP, not an opportunity for you to stroke yourself off while pretending anyone wants to have their livelihood shit the bed because of a pandemic, or that anyone feels good finding out they were less valuable to the economy as a working person than they are sitting at home. I don’t get free money either i get to keep working and be underpaid while losing my other income streams, but I understood that is irrelevant to whether the 600 extra a week was having a good impact on gdp and spending numbers. 

And at least be less stupid if you’re gonna be so nasty- the point was that extra money went right back into circulation and was an effective stimulus to SPENDING. And it’s going away but those jobs aren’t coming back anytime soon.WW2, and see what happened afterwards?People stopped going out before the mandatory shutdown and people have continued that trend. By how much is what we’ll see.I agree with you, however if you look at the markets during the spanish flu they took an initial dip then recovered.  However I do understand almost everything has changed since then and these are different times.  I do think /u/Witn's point was that it is still a possibility regardless of how slim the outlook is.But he can google it. Ha ha haYou’re criticizing a entire field for failing to predict things that are notoriously hard (maybe impossible) to predict?That's a great way to phrase itJust wait until the Fed starts tightening the reins...This doesn't make sense from an economics perspective.  In 08, the root cause of the problem was simply a jarring reallocation of paper wealth as people defaulted on loans. But nothing prevented the economy from continuing to function,  unabated. Nothing was destroyed.  It was just a psychological crisis.  The pandemic, by contrast, has literally ground the economy to a halt. Businesses are closed and people cannot be in close proximity to each other,  meaning many people cannot contribute anything to the economy.  Production and service have been significantly curtailed. Restaurants are going out of business left and right.  So are other businesses that depend on in person face to face activity (think,  most entertainment). And a significant portion of surviving economic activity has been rerouted to dealing with the pandemic itself (i.e., expensive overhead costs that didn't exist a few months ago, and will simply get us back to where we used to be, at best). This crisis is much more fundmanental than a hiccup in the allocation of credits and debits between borrowers and lenders.Gotta time becoming a middle tier manager for after the recessionLeast you have experience. Today's youngsters have no idea how fucked they really are.[deleted]California is pretty good but I’m still only make 50% of why I normally do.

I’m in Los Angeles.What happened to the savings rate during this time? Record highs. Guess it wasn’t going right back into circulation. Many people were making more money on unemployment than previously and they were saving that money. It was basically Japan stimulusWe are still missing the war part... for nowWell of course that is their job and why they get paid the big dollars.
If you follow the path of the Fed chairmans they are there to pander to the hedge funds and institutional investors.
When Bernanke left he got a cushy 1 million dollar a year consulting job with Citadel one of the biggest hedge funds in the world.
That is because Ken Griffin the founder acknowledged that without the fed printing  all that money his fund would have been toast during the 2009 crisis. Same with Goldman sachs and all the other big boys.

So if aircraft industry makes planes that fall out of the sky because making planes is difficult they should not be criticized? How about if the power industry could not supply reliable power?

Economy is called the dismal science for a reason.
Would you call political science a real science?They never willYou don't get it.  You have bearish glasses on.

Only certain sectors have suffered.  Travel and entertainment (restaurants and movies) and gyms.  Restaurants didn't necessarily go to 0 as they had take out.

Home depot, Walmart, Amazon, Lowe's, online software, computer hardware went crazy.  Gym equipment sold like there's no tomorrow.  Likewise, where is gas now.  An overreaction dip to (-) futures territory and now back to same prices as before.

People are adapting at work and shop and school, so no more shutdowns en masse.  The economy is picking up and businesses have reopened or will be created to fill.the bk void.  Just look globally.  Have things come to a halt in Australia, EU, Brazil, Canada, China?  If the answer is no, then the US won't either.I’m a registered patent attornery for fucks’ sake, trapped in document review hell. I just want out into an actual job with actual responsibilities, actual advancement opportunities, and actual pay/benefits. I know i am good because with zero mentorship or guidance or firm resources, i have successfully written and prosecuted patents claims thru to grant/issuance as a solo practitioner, and have been kept on as a permatemp with the same shitty agency for 5 years now (so i’m worth keeping and needed year round always rolled onto a new project with the same firm, but kept as a temp because fuck me). 

I made more bartending. I would be ahead if i had just kept bartending after college. 

I’m licensed in CA. I’ve done patent litigation, licensing, also complex business litigation, securities fraud, pharmaceutical/FDA law, class action work, ITC cases, industrial contracts, and more. 

Oh, and i went to Yale for undergrad, and then a t1 law school, and had several firms offer me summer associate spots. I went with the safest, most pretigious firm in the lot... still got laid off along with my entire cohort. I almost should have said yes to the howry or dewey offers - at least the firms that collapsed didnt make everyone they shitcanned over not having work sign an NDA. They just died out loud instead.Damn you’re bad at staying on topic. What happened to SPENDING? About 71 cents of every dollar of that 600 went right into spending and back into the economy. And massive inroads were made into paying down cc debt, too. 

And yes, savings went up. These are all GOOD things. You’re making my argument for me here. You’re saying good things are happening with the 600 extra weekly. But you’re a sandy little butthole because other people whose jobs were taken away with shutdowns and work furloughs got the money and you gotta work. Sounds like you didnt really mean it when you suggested you liked earning your money LOL. Sour grapes over an effective and necessary stimulus SMDH. Stop complaining about America effectively helping Americans for once, just because you want free money too.war is the only missing one out of the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse so far in 2020!Lmao that you think you can compare engineering to economics. Physical properties of matter are known and constant. The variables affecting economic predictions are influenced by human decisions that are not known or constant. 

Also not sure why every argument on this sub devolves into cynical comments about the Fed. If the Fed didn’t print money during the financial crisis, we would have had massive deflation and would probably be beating each other with clubs and drawing on cave walls right now.The Fed corporate debt ownership went from $2T in 2007 to $4T last year. Then, in the months since February, we have managed to climb to over $7T. And we haven't even "slowed the curve" yet.... I promise you there is a ceiling somewhere in there where the Fed goes into triage...You're right.  The entire economy did not grind to a complete halt. I should have been more precise.  Large segments of the economy ground to *nearly* a complete halt and many more have been significantly affected.  But I think you are unrealistically minimizing the breadth and depth of the problem.  First,  many states did literally "shut down" for up to two months.  And even those that didn't imposed significant restrictions on business and freedom of movement.  Restaurants,  bars, airlines, hotels, rental cars, short term rental properties, gyms, salons, theaters, arenas, stadiums, concert and performance venues, museums, indoor kids activities,  and things like bookstores, department stores, and other reatilers have been seriously affected and will continue to be for some time. There may have been cause for optimism 6 weeks ago. Sure enough,  the stock market exploded at the first tenuous signs of recovery.  But those hopes were promptly dashed as states reopened and the virus spread even further out of control than it had in March. Now states are shutting things back down again and will continue to do so.  And it's looking less and less likely that schools will be able to reopen next month.  I don't know what "en masse" means,  but three of the five largest states in the country are overwhelmed right now. California recently announced that most schools will not reopen. Florida wants to open schools but it's not going to be possible in many counties. Schools being closed will affect every industry. And of course the market has responded by.... ignoring the grim reality and continuing to blow up on the theory that it's only younger people, or there are fewer deaths and hospitalizations, or states won't need to shut back down again --- every which hope has been immediately proven wrong,  and which the market continues to ignore. 

 Other countries were able to basically eradicate the virus at the outset with swift testing and tracing.  But the virus spread virtually undetected in the U.S. for weeks and weeks due to large numbers of forgein visitors at multiple ports of entry and botched initial testing by the CDC (which relied on contaminated, ineffective tests for weeks) and by FDA (which initially prevented states from using their own tests). By the time we got our ducks in a row, the virus had spread far too widely to eradicate.  Add to that the fact that we have an inherently weak federal government, by design,  and a huge population beholden to 50 different state governments that are primarily responsible for regulating the health and welfare, and further add that right now, we just so happen to have an incompetent and inept federal administration that has neither the desire nor ability to effectuate even the limited responsibilities that would normally fall to the federal government in our system.

Yes, people are adapting. Good for Amazon and Home Depot.  But huge numbers of people previously contributed to society (and our GDP) by providing goods or services that are suddenly unwanted,  unneccessary, or impossible to safely provide (bar service, sit down restaurant service, professional sports and other entertainment,  travel,  and tourism). Many of those people are now no longer contributing anything to society or the GDP at the moment. Some even by choice  because the federal government has been subsidizing people to stay home by paying them more than what they had been making or would make if they returned to work! That in turn is being subsidized by additional federal debt, which is exploding at a time when economic output is being greatly curtailed.   As the fed and Congress print more money, take on more debt, and pump it into the economy,  inflation has grown at a quicker and more noticeable rate than any other time in my lifetime.   Have you been to a restaurant or grocery store lately?  

All of this is what I mean by fundamental problems.Wow. I thought IP was supposed to be relatively recession proof.  I'm going to send you a messageHave you checked around the Bay Area (I assume you have)? With the legal experience you claim to have I feel like you’d fit in well with companies there.

Maybe time to get out of Cali?Perhaps consider a career with the USPTOYou might seriously want to consider .gov work. DoD is always hiring patent attorneys and doesn't really give a crap about if you got laid off.Fine then my point is then they should not call or pretend economics is a science.
It is insulting to real science.
It is like calling a car a plane.Yeah well, the feds had a big hand in creating the problem in the first place.
They reduce interest rates bc of the tech bubble  crash of 2000 (which by the way they created), they did not enforce their own rules with mortgages making it possible for anyone with a pulse to get multiple mortgages and other shenanigans possible. Then they don't recognize the problems they help create until the big panic and selloff occurs. Then they print a ton of money and come to the rescue.
Then rinse and repeat. These guys are suppose to be the best economist too LOL.

I have had my best year investing so far because of the fed. Up more than 30% because of Gold and buying the qqq when the feds announced their trillion dollar stimulus. But if you had listen to the economists in March you would be hiding under a rock and selling everything. 
But IMO the fed suck for helping create these problems in the first place.
Why do you care are you an economist? 
I care because I have most of my saving in the markets.I promise you, there is notIf we were close to it, you would see a sell off in bonds from non-fed ownership.En masse is all together.

Virus may be spreading, but deaths are down.

If death is no longer a risk, then people will resume daily life if pols don't intervene irrationally.  

Even with the new cases, the stock market is continuing its grind higher.  Yes, it will pullback sometime and the news will use covid or trade as the reason, but don't be fooled.  The market has marched up from spx 280p since May.  Nasdaq has hit all time highs.  A pullback is coming just because that's how the market works.

People are also choosing to stay unemployed because the benefits are more than $15/hr.I am IN silicon valley. I dont have enough experience because my legal careef starts with a biglaw layoff after 1 year and thus nobody will touch me. I can’t get additional quality experience to overcome that early out-of-my-control layoff because, again, the biglaw layoff during the recession *means nobody will touch me* except dead end shitty doc review whose wages go DOWN not up. Bartending would have been a better career. 

This is why i said biglaw destroyed my career before it even started. Once you’re stuck in document review  hell (i have to eat and i have bills, fuck me right?) nobody will touch you. Nobody outside of law will hire me, because they assume i will “jump ship as soon as i find a good lawyer job,” except i CANT get a good lawyer job which was Why i was trying to exit the profession. I’m trapped. This is why my friends killed themselves. No hope.They want more years of experience than I have (they wouldn't consider contract dob review hell "experience). But I will try anyway.The department of defense is hiring patent attorneys?

That is news to me. I was told the DoJ is hiring patent attorneys and patent litigators, but their website only states openings for unpaid law student internships....You’re just another cynic who doesn’t understand monetary policy. Have a good evening.I mean if I could print more money for myself anytime why wouldn't I?Really? Not even at 100 trillion? 1000? 1000000?Do you have any science or engineering background?Oh my yes, they're always hiring patent attorneys. My biggest regret working in .gov was not being a patent attorney. It won't make you a multimillionaire, but you'll make a better wage than doc review. 

Couple tips: when you look for federal jobs, look to usajobs.gov, that's where they're supposed to start the job hunt. 

https://www.usajobs.gov/Search/Results?k=Attorney&p=1

https://www.usajobs.gov/Search/Results?k=Patent%20Attorney

Be aware they have some form of (very) rigid pay grade scale, based on the GS scale. When the advert says 'starts at', that's assuming the minimum point on the scale. Someone like you, 10 years experience, you should be able to press for high up along GS13. 

Right now the government is in a minor hiring freeze, usually there are 10-15 positions open nationwide. And generally once you're in, you can move around a little bit. 

I know a couple engineers who worked at that China Lake place in the second link. They said there's a lot of interesting stuff being developed all the time out there. You might be able to get telework, or work there a couple years, get the experience, then transfer to another location.I think I understand it too well.
The Fed is now a slave to the stock market, the market now dictates the feds actions.
But that was not the mandate for the fed they just make it up as they go along.
AlL the fed knows how to do is print money and destroy the value of money.
But it is not just the fed all governments around the world are doing it.
They are destroying the middle class and savers. Money is will be trash you need to have assets.

BTW If economists predictions were any good they would be running a hedge fund and raking in the millions instead of working at some financial institution.

Good luck to you.we'll default and go to war before we reach that point. its the american wayWe will never encounter itYes, you need one to become a registered patent attorney.You don’t have to tell me. All of you guys have the same stupid argument. Heard it a hundred times.We'll find it within the next two months.Oh - in Australia we dont need to do that.  Here we need a science/eng degree plus industry and/or research experience.  Most folks have a PhD and usually some extra work history - no legal background for the most part - they train you in legal matters on the job for a couple of years before you become a 'real' examiner.

Maybe you can do night school or online education?From your well thought out arguements NOT, you must be an economist or an aspiring one.LOLI used to be one of those 'there's no way this is sustainable' types. But then I realized that the textbooks and mathematical models don't make the rules - people make the rules, and that means we can change the rules on a whim. The only hard limit to financial chicanery is access to resources. If you start getting cut off from resources, then your house of cards can collapse swiftly. 

When the U.S. would run out of adequate resources is insanely difficult to predict. Nobody knows, not even the Fed. But it doesn't look imminent to me. It's a long road we're kicking this can down.I went to Yale and have a science background; the problem isn't needing more school, it's lacking job experience i cannot get because those jobs require job experience i lack and cannot get bc those jobs require experience i lack and cannot get...around and around in a circle.. 

US murdered any semblance of on-the-job training years ago.I could explain what the Fed does and how it has prevented the last two recessions from becoming extremely severe. I could ask you why you think the Fed causes damage when every other credible central bank does essentially the same thing. I could post articles exploring these issues. I could explain why low interest rates are warranted and show models of the natural rate of interest that indicate that rates would be low without Fed intervention. 

Would any this information change your mind? Is there any information that anyone could provide that would make you change your opinions?We're good, talk to me in exactly 3 weeks, then we'll talk again a month after. Currency shocks and negative rates by then. I spent my time learning what's left in the barrel, mayn!The lAst two recessions  they had a big hand in creating. Then fixed by providing  easy money .
They will never exit QE because the market will spank them if they do and the fed is a slave to the markets.

I am sure there are alot of fed lovers out there like yourselves who think they can do no wrong.
And they can  write articles and reports professing their love of the fed.
And just bc other governments are doing it as well does not make it a good thing.

Ideally the fed should be abolished and the markets should be free to decide rates.
Why should a bunch of ivory tower old guys get to decide what rates are?
Are they a smarter than the market? LOL NO!
Right now we do not have capitalism it's more like socialism for the wealthy.
When the rich need a bailout the fed is there but the middle class is getting destroyed.

I am making good money from the idiots at the fed so maybe I shouldn't bad mouth them  so much LOL.So no then.**Hi, welcome to /r/investing. Please note that as a topic focused subreddit we have higher posting standards than much of Reddit:**

Should be 342 callI have to say. Great analysis and discussion. I don't currently trade options because I have never done my due diligence to learn. However These 4 part posts we're a great read. Thank youThis is a great series, thanks so much /u/_WhatchaDoin_. I guess what I'm doing now is investing. I followed your 3a Post (simple strategies), where you mention to track options. I use a few resources (finviz of course), but my favourite is [unusualwhales](https://unusualwhales.com) to pick up unusual traffic. Then I can do my covered calls, verticals, and short puts depending on how things are going. So thanks for letting me know.

I also from your 4a post, started to consider checking out [yahoo finance](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/). Ain't so bad, but does tell you where the big wigs think the little guys should go (not realizing we are actually big ourselves).The only way to beat an unwinnable game is to not to playGreat read, it's really interesting how everyone's hedging strategies vary. Personally I like to have 2 layers of hedges and always carry a 5-10% hedge in my portfolio. One hedge for a standard -10% pullback from a high point and one for a 20%+ crash that often expires worthless. 

When volatility was low, I'd buy one SPX put 50-60 DTE for a 10% pullback and another 90-120 DTE super far OTM for a 20%+ crash. I roll the first put every \~30 days and let the 90-120 day one go all the way to expiration before I buy again.  I buy these every time the market hits a big high point like 3000, 3200, 3300, 3400. Caught the recent 3200 to 3000 pullback and made a nice profit, and then I lost it back this week when the pullback only went from 3200 to 3155. I don't try to make money on my hedges but more so do them to reduce my max. loss amount per day. Also I am mostly cash right now and don't hedge as much cuz volatility so high. 

Before the rona crash I don't think selling covered calls was smart because volatility was so low and we were in a strong bull market, but now that VIX is over 25 it works a lot better and I've been selling a lot of premium as well. I like to layer it on bit by bit every day, selling into spikes/dips, and always roll once or twice if I can before taking a loss. I've been averaging about 10% a month the last 3 months, been working great and it's very hard for me to take a big loss no matter what happens.This was top on the wallstreetbet's version of this, and think it is probably helpful here as well:

I am part of a discord for [unusual options](https://unusualwhales.com/) that has a long list of trading tips from users. I think some might be useful here, especially when trading big whale plays.

From the Whale:

1) I usually only trade Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday/ Thursday EOD/Friday EOD 2) I only play sectors I am confident in 3) If i see something that looks truly unusual (ie: I don't know this ticker, why is it have such high volume, let's look at the bids, let's look at its option history, let's see what on twitter/stocktwits is being said about that) at the morning/lunch/EOD, I may trade it. A great example of this is Friday contacts a month ago on INO, which netted over 1000% when all was said and done. 4) History and flow is most important. If I have been trading for a while and the market is topsy-turvy, I know when an alert comes in (and I check the history), I may be in for a quick intraday play. If things seem slowly growing, longer out, I know to play longer, directionally. 5) Don't FOMO ever 6) If you have a smaller account limit your exposure. Bigger accounts can make winners run longer, and take more losses. 7) News is most important. An alert is often proceeded by a flurry of news in most tickers. Figure out what that news is. If you can't find anything, could potentially ignore. 8) If you are having a bad day, don't make it worse by revenge trading. A whale alert are usually quite OTM, capturing direction. You will get greedy and lose momentum if you are chasing. 9) Figure out your trading style and stick to that schedule 10) Discuss your trades, momentum, thoguhts here. People are very helpful since we all have the same goal.

From one of the users: 1. Do the math to figure out the money volume. 500 volume might sound impressive, but if it's 500 contracts of a .02 contract, it only cost about 0.02 \* 100 \* 500 = $1000. Even a smaller trader might have done that as a gamble, so I'm cautious. They could still work out but I wouldn't bet the farm. 2. If there's at least $20,000 to $50,000 of volume (100 times ask price times volume), I'm interested. 3. If there's over $100,000, or especially over $1,000,000, I'm very interested. 4. Is it a company I recognize? If not, do a quick google search. 5. Check the options chain for the day of expiration, with volume and open interest shown. Typically, whales will have high volume (new contracts) and low open interest (old contracts) for the day. Are there any other strikes that show very similar amounts of volume? 6. If I see very similar unusual volume on another strike, I stay out. For example if the $100 call and the $120 call both have 5000 volume, one was a whale pick, and everything else is low, that's probably a spread. If there's a call and a put with similar volume, that's maybe a strangle or straddle. If there are two calls and two puts, all with high unusual volume, that's probably a huge iron condor. If I were smarter I might try to guess the intent of these plays, but the point is, they're not simple "someone bought a huge call" plays, most likely. 7. Is it a call in the tech sector for a company I'm confident in? Is the expiration in the next month or two? If so, I'm very likely to take it. 8. This is where things get fuzzy. I might discuss with other Discord people to see if they have clues about the play and whether it's good. If the expiration is very far out like 2021, or I don't know the company, I might stay out. I'm more cautious about puts, but some pay off.

UPDATE: Do careful research before going heavy on tech stocks since July 2020 has seen a downturn in NASDAQ's momentum.

Another from a user there: I mentioned this in #general-market-chat but basically when the market goes down (especially if it's likely temporarily, which today probably is the case), the best thing to do if you have open calls is not to sell them (unless it's like going past the point of no return, like mayb Tesla). Buying a put, especially as the market goes down rapidly, tends to outpace your call losses, because the price momentum is escalating downwards, which increases the gamma of your puts. So effectively, your puts gain value faster than your calls lose value. Additionally, you can also lock your calls in a credit or debit spread by selling one strike up or down (this is best right when it starts to fall, because this more or less locks in losses/gains).

I think this list is really useful for the time being. I'll write more if people are interested.  


Not sure how to crosspost or format properly tbh.This is the perfect thread to ask this question!

If I have NBL call options set for far into the future, now that CVX is buying them, what happens to my options?Gonna have to give this a deeper read later. I've been gambling with options with play money but I've been wanting to actually start using it smartly in my IRA and real brokerage accountI haven't done the math on this, but would it be better in your SPY hedge to use shorter term put spreads? I'm just thinking that if SPY were going up like in your example, that to have a protective put adjusted ( maybe quarterly),  to be at 8% less than the current price rather than the purchase price. You would have been able to retain much of your profit on SPY (assuming you were willing to sell when it got to the limits of your hedge), as well as a profit on the hedge. I may be missing something so not sure if this would work.UpvotedAwesome!remindme 16 hrsThanksThx!thanks Man!don't let my brothers from wsb see this!remindme 7 hrsThank you for your insightful examples especially around Advanced Hedging buying a Long duration Bear Put Spread, and paying for it with OTM Covered Calls (secured by Stock)

**Regarding your Buy Calendar Put on DBO:**

 *June 305: BUY +1 DBO OCT 16 20 / JUL 17 20 7 PUT @ 0.45* 

Was this setup sort of ATM given the current pricing is around $7.35?

1) What's the criteria to determine where you place your Back-month Put? Support Floor, 1.5-2 SD based on IV of that back month?

2) Would be ideal to have a lower IV in the back month, and a higher IV in the front months?

3) As the stock price goes up, would you trail the Short Put Option (changing it into a Diagonal Spread) and sell closer to ATM (0.40-0.50 Deltas), in order to maximize premium selling. 

4) Would it be possible to Buy LEAP Put Debit Spread (adding another short leg) instead of a LEAP Put, and then sell the Front Month Puts?

or is my understanding around odd number (3-legs) option strategy is in correct and it actually does not reduce margin impact and risk the way I think it does?Hey I really appreciate all these posts and have been working my way through them. It’s going to take a few reads to get my head around it properly - this is because it is kinda complicated and I’m a bit dense - but you have explained this so well.

What id like to understand is how do I take what you have written and make it practically and use it so it goes from theory to something I can actually understand at a practical level. The obvious answer is to start trading but I feel like I would like to do that ina  measured way, with small amounts, so I can actually see what happens. I know there are some tools that will calculate trade outcomes for you and you can paper trade on think or swim but is there some advice you can give about how to use these guides for options trading when you are really at the beginning and want to ease into it in a way that will be sustainable. I really appreciate the effort you put into these guides thanks to much. You should consider a YouTube channel
On sameOops, yeah. Good call! :) Fixed.Thank you! You are welcome!Lmao, reaper, i just posted about the whale discord? You in there?Thanks for sharing!

Ooh, that's interesting. I don't like losing money on my hedge, so I am trying to have all my hedge come for free. (for better or for worse :) ).

Yeah, I stopped selling covered calls in the past few (several?) years. But right now, you throw a dart anywhere, and you get a good return, even accounting for a market drop. Quite happy how things are turning out, but I am careful with my positioning in case we drop significantly again. Stay safe!As the stock price stabilize to its final value, the volatile will drop (volatility crush) as the future price is known. If there are some doubts about the merger, volatility / price could be out of whack a bit tough.Thank you for the comment.

The long term options are comparatively cheaper than short term options, hence the calendar like build.

&#x200B;

11 months away:

BUY +1 SPY JUN 18 21 295/240 PUT @ 12.01

&#x200B;

3 months away:

BUY +1 SPY OCT 16 20 295/240 PUT @ 6.28

So I have 27% of the duration for 52% of the price. It's not worth it. It means now that I have to sell my short calls for $2.09 instead of $1.09. This will make me hit the upside much sooner.

FWIW a JUNE 2022 cost $15.22, so an even lower cost per expiration. It still increases the risk short term (due to 26% premium increase), but it reduces the short calls premium needed to $0.66. Downside is that after 1-2 years, the market went up by 10% a year, do your protection is less effective. You can roll your protection up, but its value gets eroded quite significantly never the less.There is a 25 hour delay fetching comments.

|-|-|-|-|No problem. Really comprehensive tutorial! Do you plan to play calender call for next week's earnings?Shouldn't you be looking at delta if you're comparing those two puts as  way to hedge?

Also, an 8%OTM put is not going to hedge 100 shares for an 8% drop because delta will be somewhere between .35 and .6 - meaning that at best, you are hedging 60% of your 8% dropNah, too busy at work during the week. :)

Market could move quite a bit this week. I'm cautious.Correct, to Hedge 100% of your long position with a 8% drop with a bear spread, you will need many more contracts. This also means you will over hedged the more the price goes down. This comes at a high cost, which will kill your profit. This delta will depend on stock price, time, etc. Good luck trying to have the perfect hedge at an acceptable price.

I hedge based on the expiration date, so I need only 1 contract per 100 shares in case the market is down still after a year. That being said, if the market drops and my bear spread reaches 80% to 90% of the profit already, I will sell. Which is how I profited from the March drop by using the cash to increase my positions.Hopefully for the better #bulllifeI think if you rolled more often, you'd be able to accomplish the same hedge for less cash burn.

Also, it might be possible to achieve the same results cheaper with a different hedge, maybe spxl puts or calls on vxx or sqqq?Options on leveraged etfs ain’t cheap.

I am eager to learn. Do you have some concrete example, with a similar protection as I explained above?

FWIW rolling / buying month to month the protection as long as the market does not move or goes up is cheap. I agree. However as soon as the market will drop a bit, even less than 10%, a similar protection will be get very expensive, and by then it’s too late. And you may have to pay it every month.BTW, I'm not shitting on your strategy, more just trying to adapt it to my own needs.

Instead of one 8% OTM spy put per 100 shares, you could probably go one 24% OTM spxl put per 35 shares - same results, cheaper hedge???I like the that the decay, esp on sideways market, helps a SPXL put, but looking at the numbers, I am not sure this is cheaper overall.

We are all learning, so I welcome the new ideas. I am interested in making this better (and actually I am iterating on something right now that is even more efficient, albeit a really weird construct).

First, when the market tanked by 35%, I would expect SPXL to blow up, but it did not. It dropped from $70 to $20, so around 70%. We probably get 2.5x on upside and downside instead of 3x.

Now let’s assume that it is 3x, picking a put 24% OTM seems the right thing to do (again potentially helped a bit by the decay). Although the put seems around 25% cheaper per contract (Strike of $37), it does not seem to really hedge as much as what we need. Assuming SPXL blows up and reach $0, the most hedge we got was $37 per share.

However, for my SPY share, assuming that I want to protect between 8% and 25% drop, I.e. 17% of $325, so $55.25 dollar for a 25% drop. So I will need 1.5 SPXL PUT contract To hedge 100 shares (And not 1/3), and overall that makes for a higher cost compared to a 8%/25% vertical on SPY. Let me know if my math is off.

To get to 1 SPXL contract per 300 shares, we would need SPXL to be priced roughly at the same price as SPY (so 6x higher), which would increase the put price roughly by as much.**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

FAANG: +35%
SPY ex-FAANG: -5%

The *indices* are way up. The *markets* are not. The current rally is predicated entirely on FANMAG performance.With the exception of Duke energy which I just don't know, I think all of those will do just fine in the long run.

My current losers are:

Raytheon (RTX) -8%

Boeing (DERP) -15%OP, tell us your next pick so we can inverse you.Jesus I just dumped my money into MSFT because I'm not smart but at least know Microsoft is a steady performerTHIS calmed down the 'emotional selling' part of my brain for some reason. I guess we're friends now.Maybe you should just buy ETF...Howard Hughes - down 34%

Nutrien - down 30%

Spinmaster toys - down 22%If it makes you feel better, many of my stocks from start-up companies have been down by more than 50%

I also bought WFC at $32
And my overall performance since 2017 is negativeYou invested in Uber? Oh no why would you do thatI got screwed on WFC. I am almost 50% down. 

However, I am glad I got Costco, Visa, Nike, MSFT, WMT and AppleYou are buying stocks because of stock charts.  

Besides maybe INTC, these were all companies that have fallen from their all time highs and perhaps look "cheap" on a chart. Even INTC can be said to be "cheap" when you bought it when you look relative to the outperformance of all other tech stocks.

The saying "buy low sell high" is not helpful but a lot of people follow it blindly by looking purely at stock price.  What is often true is that winning companies in their sectors tend to continue to win, and other companies that cling to their past will continue to fail.  I wouldn't recommend any oil/gas stocks because the world is shifting into renewals.  Slowly, yes, but surely.Went hard into AMZN right before tech took a hit.  I feel your pain.I bought WFC at $32 too, guess I just have to do the bag holding for a while.Intel just hit a bad break. Can’t go by today’s bomb. I just wonder how much AMD will go up and if or at what point pull the profits and wait for next dipI'm awful at this, and even if know these picks are bad. Wells Fargo's name is synonymous with shit, they are getting no new customers and rate environments are going to be very low for a long time which crushes traditional bank's margins. Intel can't tell their ass from a whole in the ground.  The rely on contractors for lots and lots of everyday work and treat them like garbage. They are already 2 years behind AMD and even more if you factor in the time required for their management to pull their heads out of their own butts. They're surviving on manipulations and bs only and it's only a matter of time until sales plummet. Exxon is going to suck until the virus is over and people can drive around again. Plus every shitty Petro kleptocracry is desperate for revenue so supply should be up like crazy.Today was particularly painful for Intel. Not only were they the worst of the S&P 500, but AMD was the best.FWIW, people keep saying that Intel is the next IBM.  I hope they're right, since IBM is trading at P/E 14, and $126 per share.  :)  I think I saw somewhere that if Intel traded like AMD and NVidia it would be at $250 a share.  If I was you I'd just grin and bear it.  I'm currently long INTC, and doubled my position today.  We'll see if this was a good idea or not.WFC.. looks good at this price and most likely will have a comeback but I don't like them due to past shady stuff and current bs that they do too. Bought some intel today at 49.Except for INTC, you had it coming and I have no sympathy for you. 

You picked an oil and gas stock in a time of historically low oil prices (negative futures prices) and worldwide demand suppression due to covid lockdowns and a price war between Russia and Saudi?!?! Good thinking /s.

Then you picked Duke energy?!!?! Thinking what, that people are home so they are watching more TV and running the AC? Utilities are defensive stocks that you don't pick when equity markets are rallying. These stocks are more boring than T-Bills. If you want to be defensive buy puts on SPX. Or buy gold ETFs. Or T-Bills.

Then Wells Fargo. A sh*t bank. Always buy quality (fundamentally strong) and strength (momentum, breakouts, higher highs). A stock that lacks one or both of these will either test your patience or destroy your capital.

Uber! Heard of social distancing. Getting into a stranger's car isn't the best idea to avoid covid. And Uber to where? The local bar? To the airport (planes have been flying at 10-30% capacity)? Have you bought American or Delta as well? Lol

Mind you I'm not using hindsight. It's plainly obvious that businesses that require customers with disposable income, or will suffer because of social distancing are companies to avoid.

And if your can't pick stocks then buy index funds. Or futures with puts to protect the downside.It's impressive that you managed to pick all shit tier companies to invest in lmaoLet me guess... the dividends? 

INTC because ...kept going higher and higher 

And Uber because....Uber owns the market?Stop looking at energy and dividends. And dont buy anything to do with ride sharingYou bought energy at a time of unprecedented lack of demand. 

You bought banks at a time where people are going to be defaulting on loans left and right and millions are unemployed. 

You bought Uber during a pandemic where not only are people traveling less places due to lockdowns, but they’re also weary of being cooped up in a vehicle with a stranger. 


Intel was just a shit pick regardless of the timing, they’ve been losing market share to AMD for a while now and if you are into building computers or learning about these companies you would have known that AMD processors are shitting on Intel at almost every price point. 


Stick to the indexes bro.Wait till Monday.  It will probably be red.Man that is some pwnsauceAre you investing in businesses or betting what the price will be in a few months? If it’s the former buy more if it’s the latter you should probably change your strategyjust buy SPYGYou forgot eBay 😔everyone give predictions like they know which direction stocks will move. spoiler: stock market is random, lots of manipulation happen behind the scenes, etc. holding position on one stock means you are giving trust to predictions, but how to predict which prediction is correct? basically you cannot, so you should only go index fund and stay safePray for my BAC and ALLY callsThis is why I only buy indexes.So you're saying nows a good time to get in on all these? Lol.Uber , Well Fargo and Exxon? You can only blame yourselfI bought cloudflare and AZN at their heights. (40 and 59) I don't know, I thought i was jumping on an hype train but so far lost a pretty penny lol. Everything else - ETFs are all negative. Then my call took a dump and I've lost the whole week.. 😩Most of your picks are just bad timing and will go back up once the virus situation is better. You should pick stocks that have more to do with tech and e-commerce if you want short gains. I'd hold long most of your picks.Delta down 1.88%

Exxon down 0.11% 

I bought these as kind of like more rebound long term plays though so it's actually sort of going quite wellBesides Uber and Duke which I’m not terribly familiar with, I feel like these will be fine a few years down the line, plus some nice divvies.

My biggest loser this year is NCLH, average cost of 17.5. Might make a large average down buy this week though and come back next year.That's what you get for investing in shintelYou're my hero!  You should start a blog.Confederate Cotton is doing horribly.Sell losersI've lost my shirt on Uber. I bought one share at $41.37 and now it is $31.😭😂 sounds like me. Whenever I make a measly $50, I throw a party for myself because none of my stocks generally want to move one way or anotherI feel you.
I went against my better judgment and bought WFC at $32 as well. I didn't like WFC for their shady practice...it's okay, i bought 300 shares of intel today, hopefully we can ride the wave up.. covered call july 31 55 at 25 a popBought Simon Property Group at 70, now at 61.Low volatility stocks but bad picksLol ripI bought 300 shares of Boeing a while back at 174 and rode it all the way up to 238. Wish I sold since its now back down to where I bought it at.Intel is going to continue to do poorlyI see your Intel, Uber and Wells Fargo and raise  with Macy's, GE, Kraft-Heinz.Good picks bro, just ride it out. Ten years down the road you’ll be laughing.easy, buy high sell low lolSir you're doing it wrong.  You're supposed to just buy NDAQ and NDAQ only from now on.Anybody buy gas / oil when it crashed end of April ?My fucking timing has been awful the last couple of months. It's really starting to piss me off.Same here have Uber Intel and XOM. Sold intel cos they can’t really compete with AMD and TSMC. Uber I see a lot of upside potentially though (in the perspective of them being the one stop shop for transportation), very forward looking but it is a high risk high return bet. XOM, oil price will recovery and we are still far from getting rid of oil. It will come back. I m optimistic.I don't have the numbers on hand, but I hold some AMD and Nvidia over Intel and JPM over Wells Fargo and all of those were up last I checked. Not big on Uber or the energy sector personally (means I lost out on a big oil boom ig *shrug*)You’re picking dogs in a tech-bull marketSell, sell, sell!!!!Energy Transfer (ET) - went in several times, averaging $8.5, now at $6.65 

Rest are doing really great thoughNikola?at&t for meJust bought intel too, even cheaper now. Let’s see what happens with the new chips, make or break! Great PE considering LT industry growth. Market share may suffer thanks to AMD however...Value investing doesn't work.Wow these are all I specifically not bought. Seriously. Have very good reasons not to buy each of these.

Intel - chip design houses are on the way out. Companies like apple, microsoft, and tesla will also design their own chips because they either get a deal or they just do it themselves.

Uber - Overhead is too high. Drivers are way underpaid. Growth model no longer enough.

Wells Fargo - I don't like it simply for bad PR

Duke Energy - Terrible portfolio of fossil generation. One of the largest utilities in the world will struggle to have customer load growth and prime to be (currently being) disrupted by new utility business models.

Exxon - I don't like any fossil based company but Exxon is especially bad because they aren't trying to diversify with clean tech (like Shell and BP). I take blackrock's advice to heart.Wells fargo was a very bold choiceActive picking.  Sometimes it beats the market.  Sometimes it don't.

Keep on diversifyin'You can throw in ATT in there too. Even after their hbo max launch.Just dollar cost average in $IGV and you’ll be set over the long termThanks for sharing. Could you also share your initial hypothesis when entering these positions? I think that would be an even better basis for a discussion.I apologize if someone already asked but was this as options or as regular stock?You are getting good at buy high sell low , not to worry you can always get into options and see true losses.Get Crypto.Intel is a bad investment, AMD already have the consumers side and is producing CPU's for the enterprise side.. Intel is slowly dieing.. Also prepare for a bigger drop down in the price.. The new products of intel are delayed but AMDs arnt..Its a combination of tech companies doing well (and being majority of the indices) and Trump doing everything to prop it up.I like this post, thanks for your honestyI am happy i bought jnj, amd, vz and it's greenI bought WFC before the COVID crash :) but other than that my worse performer was SPG and BMYStfu short term tinkerWhat do you see in Uber btw? I’m big time bearish on it, curious to see why you’re longMove to QQQ.You bought a ride sharing service, a financial institution, and energy company during a global pandemicr/WallStreetBets would love this story of personal triumphI’ve invested all in Solar & Cannabis stocks. I’m up 150% across the boardExxon needs $80 oil just to break even...Everything but INTC doesn’t seem like a good investment IMO. Curious what your thought process and DD is.

Oil and gas industries will never recover to their previous highs. World is shifting to renewables and they are too slow to invest in.

UBER doesn’t have an advantage over Lyft or door dash or any of the other food delivery/ ride hailing services. And once Tesla releases Tesla Network they’re will be a lot more competition that can charge lower prices profitably. 

Wells Fargo I’m just personally against due to their fraudulent activity and I think Square will be the bank of the future.So given the Corona Pandemic you bought:

&#x200B;

\- A car logistics company

\- A bank with a huge retail client base

\- 2 Energy companies. 

&#x200B;

Without over-analyzing, you should have been able to easily see how a pandemic/econmic slump would directly affect these companies.

&#x200B;

As for Intel ... somewhat unlucky but also minimal research (ie a Google/Reddit search) would have outlined their tough path ahead.Why are you complaining? I thought the *only* smart thing to do was buy and hold. Stop whining and hold the bag that you chose to pick up. If you’re going to try to play a rally you’ll want to understand the rally.Hold tight with XOM. With a little time, I’m convinced it will be easily back to $58 in no time.Stick to ETFs buddy 😂Uber though? Why would you think people will willfully want to get into a confined space with strangers. Especially when they have no where to go.It’s like you had no clue what a recession wasUBER - bought at $35, now at $31

people were on lockdown due to an easily transmitted virus that seems to spread in confined spaces.

What were you thinking?You should have bought on March 15th.I’m super bullish on Disney over the 2 year time horizo, once everything returns to normal that stock is headed to the moonJust keep hammering at it and get a better cost average.. your day will always come. 🎡Perhaps this is irrational, but WFC is massively underpriced right now. Coronavirus fears have made it stumble, but it really is a bargain right now, especially considering how they're actively going after any issues that brought it down (new CEO, for example).

Wouldn't be surprised if it hit $40 by the end of the year.Oh fuck you're down 3-10% on a few stocks, better throw yourself off the highest building on the street!

I'm sorry that your attempt to make a quick buck failed. That said, investing is a 10, 20, 40, 100 year game, and I'd happily take all of those off your hands with UBER being the exception.If only you'd shorted each of them. You'd be patting yourself on the back telling yourself that you're god's gift.

But instead you're just another pig. Slaughtered.I am only a rookie trader, but here is my advice: don't try to invest in all the different markets. Limit yourself to one or two you have the necessary knowledge about.  Trading on microchip companies, transport, finance, electric power, and oil is, in my opinion, too much. 

Remember that jack of all trades is master of none.Jesus Christ, none of the stock picks you went with made sense.My losers are XOM and INTC. My winners are my wildcard stocks: NIO, FVRR, Z, and QFIN. It seems like people are dumping money into high risk stocks  for the short-term more than long-term holds at the moment. I'm up 200% on NIO even after this week's crash, but I still don't think it's anywhere near a reasonable valuation.You picked losersThis portfolio looks like something warren buffet world haveI'd stay away from FANG and overpriced stocks. Look the USD is in a nose dive. I'd stick to gold and gold mining stocks and silver and silver mining stocks. 

The unlimited QE is having serious effects on the market. Even if you take COVID at of the equation the markets haven't even taken into account a Trump loss. 

The current administration did a lot of deregulation and this was bullish for stocks. The democrats will want crazy capital gains, dividend, and if we think money printing is bad now it will be even worse when we give away everything for free. That could very well be the end of capitalism as we know it. The markets will factor this in after labour day.

Even if we take gold and silver aside which currently I think they are the best hedge. Investors need to look for value. What is really undervalued KO for example. PFE is also a good value rate now. You need to look at balance sheet price analysis. 

We have a huge issue in the market today it went from being hugely oversold to hugely overbought. Investors have forgotten fundamentals. The market isn't a "true" reflection of the economy. Look at the financials they are bleeding, and this is what you need to look at. The market is extremely overbought.B T C - April $7,591, now at $9,573
E T H - April $196, now at $283

Should I go on?Why did you buy all these shit stocks?Tesla 570 ‐> 1500Bad earnings for FAANG would throw market into turmoil.Why not just call it FAGMAN?This really puts things into perspective.I’m scared to invest in those 5 because they’re already so high. Do you think they will just continue to grow?That would certainly explain some of it.

Still from april the ex-FAANG are up quite a bit.   Just not YTDThis is a little misleading.

The OP said since April - the numbers you list are since December.

The S&P as a whole has indeed rallied back to around pre-COVID levels, they just haven't blown past that to set new highs like the tech giants.Did you just randomly throw Microsoft in by interchanging FAANG and FANMAG?

I feel like people are just randomly adjusting their argument whenever it suits them.  You can’t just keep expanding the acronym to include every winner after the fact, and then declare all the stocks that’s not in your winner list losers - that’s not surprisingly since you are making up the list after the numbers come out.

FAANG does not include Microsoft, and never has.  Technically FANG doesn’t even include Apple.

I’d like to see FANG vs non-FANG performance but with Apple and Microsoft categorized in the latter not the former.  I think that would show there is nothing special about FANG.What's faang?fagmanDang. Here I am trying be clever picking stocks and I could be up 35% if I had gone all in on faang.Don't you mean FAANGT?  T for TSLA.That's actually perfect. I was thinking that some boring total-market ETFs might be too expensiveAs I read this comment, you have 666 up-votes. Congrats on the develish performance.

&#x200B;

IMO FAANG looks like a retail investor bubble. Evidence:

I agree some you just need to close your eyes til next year and reevaluate.You must have bought BA at the top if you are down 15%. They hovered around $120 for a large portion of the quarantine era.Uber sucks as an investment. I just don’t see a path to profitability.Good time to short Duke energy, NC can't afford to pay it's energy bills.  If the consumer can't pay the bills and the congress won't front the consumer, the energy company will crumble.i regret buying ratheon, shoulda just bought boeing. would it be a good idea to sell off raytheon or hang onto it long term?LolWMT is up next.  

As you can see I'm skewed a bit towards valueMSFT is a pretty solid company, it's not that bad of a choice for the long runBullish on MSFT. No need to panic if you’re long.In the long run this won’t matter. Probably the most solid stock out there. In terns if growth and safety.At least you didn't put your money in Tesla👍VGT and chill.I'm balls deep into ARKKSolid advice! I like SCHG these days.Think it’s worth going in now for WFC at 26$?> overall performance since 2017 is negative

Holy balls that sucks.Well I felt they have a lot of other bets outside of strictly rideshare that could take off...

And they are backed by some very big companies (google for ex) so their funding wont likely run out during covidThis guy talking about Tesla circa 2010~ “oh no you invested in Tesla why would you do that”I bought at 20.50 and I'm up 50%. Why didn't you?WMT is my sleeper pick. Stable, "essential" business that has proven it can withstand a recession. Plus they pay a higher dividend than bonds. Now they're going after deliveries and Walmart+. 

I needed some bell peppers for dinner so I used the app and 6 hours later they were at my door. I've also ordered a lot of non grocery items since I know they are same day. Mind you I have Amazon Prime.I bought WFC when the dust was settling in 2009/10 and they were starting to grow the dividend again.  Just sold it all when they announced the forced div cut. Basically those dividends were the only profit I made over the past decade.Those are good picks. I’d switch appl with amznCan appreciate this. Companies that have fundamentally changed for the worse are not going to reach prior high levels.

Intel I thought was rich enough to buy their way to ingenuity but they keep making mistakes.  Seem horribly managed.  Was definitely allured by the cheap price relative to earnings> I wouldn't recommend any oil/gas stocks because the world is shifting into renewals. Slowly, yes, but surely.

Some of the best returns in the market are found in sectors that investors have written off as "dying". Altria - formerly Phillip Morris - was one of the top total return stocks for the last 25 years, during a time in which its market has done nothing but steadily dwindle.Yeah, all my energy stocks are renewables. They fit my ethics and they perform well and consistently while capturing increasing market share. Oil is volatile as hell. My Brown advisory sustainable mutual fund is also doing really well....won't oil companies just start using that technology though? Or patenting it when refineries are shuttering?What about things like airlines? Won’t they come back sometime?Even INTC feels lackluster as a company in recent times.E&P companies specially Shell are investing into renewables. These companies have the cashflow to invest in it to prepare for the future. The future were oil and gas aren't used anymore will take longer than most think. Supermajors are here to stay but it is possible that renewables will yield lower results than oil and gas.My guess with Intel is it’s lacking in GPU technology and the fact Apple plans on making their own CPUs.Agree with everything except the end. Oil will not become irrellevant for at least another half decade and there are reasons to believe it will stay relevant even longer unless your investment advisor is Greta Thunberg and well, she is confirmed by medicine to be mentally challenged. Even so, oil companies are diversifying and the tricky part is knowing which are going to be the big ones in the new era, just like Nokia lost out to Apple in the tech switch there.I bought everything at their peak, tesla, amazon, apple and Netflix. Everyday they are going down slowly slowly. I think I broke the stock market.Buy more. If you thought it was at a good price at 32, it’s a steal at 26I’d average out. I’m not in WFC but it looks like it’s making a come back with the new CFO just being announced. They finally got rid of one of the last people from the whole fake account thing.Do you think Apple ditching Intel as a source of its processor production will have a long term affect?That’s the type of technical analysis I want to see on Bloomberg.Theres some upside to intel for sure. 

They still have the brand and reliability track record.  

Would be nice to see them actually come through on their 7nm.

Or alternatively if AMD slipsIntel is still 1/2 of a duopoly for consumer and server chips. Going off market cap and revenue it's actually more like 3/4 of a duopoly.

They blew a chip generation, they're behind the eight ball... But they still spend more on R&D in a quarter than AMD spends all year.XOM I bought when oil went negative thinking it mustve hit lows and should be able to weather for a while

The others yeah dividend was definitely a factor. 

DUK I think will do fine.  They do electricity in the southeast, which has a growing population.

INTC felt they were undervalued  because they are a cash cow at the moment.  Didnt realize they could mess up on chips so badly.lol roastedWhat would you pick? I'm new to stocks and would like some advice. I don't have a whole lot of money but I'm trying to change that for my kids. Thanks!Could be way worse I agree.  Even the hardest hit industries are showing some  resilience and hopeDuke should be fine, it's a major energy utility in the southeast part of the US.I think cruises are coming back too.  Just need another year. I'm optimistic on a vaccine.

Theyll have way more debt when they come back , and I hope they can raise prices to start offsetting thatNo $10 shirt for you loser!Lol.  See if someone else can come in and raise with Hertz, AMC, Dave and bustersLong NQ, Short ESThey're definitely the stronger versions of the same industries.Yeah $T is sagging.  And their dividend seems unsustainable based on their recent Q2 earnings.  Could bounce back but it looks like they're losing marketshare

Trades cheap though 🤷‍♂️StocksJust regular stockGrabs popcorn....This guy gets it, one net dependent tech would have made up for all of it.Yeah I hear you.  They all have headwinds in front of them and thats why they traded cheaper.

And compared to April,  looks like some if the headwinds may last longer than initially thoughtHoping for the same.  

Oil used to be a pretty decent hedge against rest of the market because cheaper oil meant cheaper shipping and transportation costs.

Now it looks pretty gloomy in the near term with all the supply.  Its like they're selling cell phone cases... yes everyone needs it... but way too many people got into that business.

Eventually though these oil companies may adaptP/E 30 = underpriced?
For a bank that commits fraud, isn't leveraging technology, has shabby customer support, in a pandemic where people aren't getting paid and not able to pay back loans this one is going to sink like a rock in a pond.I need pigs. They put food on my table. Thank you.OkDo you think NIO is worth more or less? I'm a novice at this. I got out of NIO after taking a small hit when they announced the stock issue. Felt  like they were running out of cash to compete with Tesla so I anticipated further drops.Absolutely, the issue is what would cause bad earnings? Amazon and Microsoft are both benefiting directly off of cloud with AWS and Azure with their core businesses continuing to grow. 

Hell, Microsoft is still growing at 10%+. 

Apple isn’t even the market leader of phones, that’s Android. 

Facebook IS social media which IS marketing 101 nowadays, if you want to grow your product you have to be on Instagram and paying influencers. 

The biggest threat is some sort of anti-trust action, but that’s not happening when 25% of the stock market is carried by those behemoths.

You’d need some sort of deflationary P/E movement because arguably they are high at 30+ P/E, but they’re growing so that’s not THAT crazy.exactly. 1999 vibesDidn’t seem to with Netflix.That's what I've been calling it... People think I'm talking about a superhero but I'm just trying to make moneyTAGMA. Netflix is doneಠ\_ಠBecause this isn't the purulent dumpster fire that is WSB.Idk why mods allow comments like this.Let me ask you another question that might help you. What else are you going to invest in? 

T-bills? Nope

Bonds? Nope

A savings account? Get left on the sideline either way.

Gold? Maybe

Bitcoin? China is trying to ban it, and government regulation could wipe it out overnight, but the collapse of the dollar would make it soar. The highest risk/reward you could choose.

Individual stocks? What companies have more cash to weather the storm and have whole generations of cult-like fans and reliant businesses that will use their products/services?

Market index? Smartest most of the time.Simple answer: yes for some of them. MSFT is still growing across all areas except brick and mortar stores, which is scary to consider. They are the major operating system in a world that depends upon computers.
GOOGL is everywhere. For better or worse. As a baseline, they’re making absurd amounts of money daily. Plus they have a pipeline of ideas and early stage acquisitions to fuel growth for at least a decade or two moving forward. For example Waymo/self-driving cars and developing market acquisitions.
FB has received a ton of bad publicity lately. Social media is a digital drug. It’s mentally toxic. But my goodness does it produce profit margins. I would argue FB has the best fundamentals out of the gang as of right now. 
AAPL is shifting away from devices towards services. They are pushing into media. It’s a long-game for them. I think they see the writing on the wall regarding devices being too expensive. They are working to cut prices while retaining insane margins.
Like Apple, AMZN is also shifting away from the core identity. They’re tied in with Whole Foods. They have a growing media platform (Prime and Twitch). AWS isn’t going anywhere.
NFLX is the weakest link IMO. But a coronavirus/stay inside situation helps keep them afloat. They are increasingly becoming a Hollywood production company. Teens nowadays don’t know this was the player that killed Blockbuster video.

The biggest thing to note with everyone except Netflix is the functional lack of debt. FB doesn’t have any. Apple has money offshore. Google has very little. Microsoft has an average amount it doesn’t need to worry about. I bring this up because these companies can straight up buy the competition/startup/new idea. 

My only concern is governments declaring these companies too big. I’m not talking taxes. I mean legally splitting up the castles into smaller assets.It weirds me out considering FANG includes Facebook (a trash advertising company) but not Microsoft (a trillion $+ company, currently the second largest publicly traded by market cap). 

Decades from now, Microsoft will still be standing. Facebook will not.Hold cashBought at about $205. Bad move in the short term, but nowhere near top.They lost $8b last yr. I keep waiting for investors to catch on...Autonomous cars.With the latest developments in China/US relations, defense stocks might be a good hold long-term lol.Raytheon is still super solid IMHO. The US has the best defense/weapon manufacturers in the world. Raytheon is still certainly one of the best on Earth, and they are still priced lower then they probably should be. Areas of the world are in constant turmoil, and they want our weapon systems. They say only two things in life are guaranteed - death and taxes. I'd add war to that.Thanks. Ok everyone, you heard it.

Guess who got to sell first when the shit hit the fan? Not you.

It's hard to tell the quality of a company by who backs them, because the backers are looking out for their own interests, not yours.I'm not a big Tesla fan. But even I wouldn't compare Tesla to the dumpster that is Uber. Uber is a contractor management company with no moat. The same cannot be said about Tesla...Objectively, Tesla is still a terrible investment.Comparing Uber to Tesla...lolllI’ve been buying up Uber dips like crazy. They are a very long term hold for meBecause I don't invest in garbage. I suggest you should sell, while you are aheadIntel was done for the day it was leaked Apple would be dropping their chips.Intel did a very good job this last quarter considering their technological limitations. They are not mismanaged, they have problems reaching the next node of technology. Before you say "Well AMD has 7nm tech", AMD and Intel refer to the size of their transistors using different metrics. AMD's chips do not use the same architecture as Intel's. When Intel's 7nm chips finally come out, they will be miles better than AMDs 7nm chips.

The concern is that Intel has delayed the release of these chips by years now. They were supposed to come out Q4 of last year, and Q4 of the year before that. Now they're saying Q4 of this year, and investors have lost confidence.

The other reason they declined is their losses in MobileEye. Data processing for self-driving cars is supposed to be their next cash cow, but they are hemorrhaging money in that area right now.

Somebody correct me if I'm wrong. I am admittedly biased, I have the majority of my holdings in Intel right now so not a great day for me.Comparing tobacco and oil isn't really logical.Problem is that their entire capital is invested in old tech, and a big part of their stock valuation is precisely because there are still investors who believe their current assets are valuable.

Yes, they can switch to renewables, but they would have to abandon or sell their existing plants, equipment, technical knowhow knowledge...etc.  And don't forget there is a lot of entrenched interest in those company to keep the status quo.  

It's much simpler to invest in a startup at that point.Fellow market mover here

 I sold msft at 105 like...a year ago? AMD at 12 about 2 years ago

That would have been a nice car by nowLol.  Before this I decided to get big into options the week the pandemic hit.  We fall together brother.As long as you aren’t doing options, you’ll be fine. I bought AMD at peak when it was 28$ and it dropped to 18.Problem is these guys all buy based on the charts not on the value of a company. And well since it went down they think it’s going to go down more so they don’t buy. They wait for it to start significantly going up again to buy at which point it’s too late. They have no idea what a good price is.Anyone who touches Wells deserves to bag hold. They deserve to be out of business. Change in leadership might help, but that rot spreads and needs to be gutted entirely.Apple's r desktop market share is too small to make a difference IMO.Effect, and idk, it depends on how much Apple buys their product. It could sway other companies to not buy them which has a ripple. It will likely have a negative impact but idk how long, they are such a big company they will overcome eventually maybeIt’s really just intel and amd and intel has benefitting from being the big fish for a while so personally I think this is gonna give them a kick in the rear to not be complacent but may go down a little more firstHit me up Mike that's my dream job.I mean, $0.87 dividend on $43 aint nothing to scoff at for XOM. I think I got it earlier in the month at $36. I wouldn’t call XOM a loser if you got it sub $50. It will probably stay here until the world is back to normal(ish)How soon do you need the money bc in a year your XOM will probably be doing well + dividends reinvestedVti or VOO. Buy and hold. That’s it.I would say buy the qqq they have massively out performed the s&p and Dow since 2009.$2 or you're overpayingFor sure. Even if it does take a while, it will be worth it in the end. If it doesn’t have large price movements in the short to mid-term, it pays a very high dividend rate which will also be good in the long run.When Tesla stock shot up, everyone started trying to find the next big stock in the industry. NIO as a competitor made sense. Luckily I had been in it since $3 already. Do I think it's worth $12 per share? No. They're currently valued at $14 billion. Ford is valued at around $27 billion. Not saying Ford is the best company, but how many NIOs have you seen on the road versus Ford's? Maybe NIO has a good future, but it will be many years before they can produce the same volume of cars. And quality is another thing. Can NIO get a good quality car on the market and maintain that quality while also greatly increasing output? It's too early to say what NIO is worth, but the recent pump of the stock is unjustified in my opinion.The CEOs of Amazon, Google,.FB and Apple are meeting with Congress in a couple weeks to answer questions about antitrust accusations.>Apple isn’t even the market leader of phones, that’s Android.

One correction here: 

Apple *is* the market leader of phones, while Android (Google) is the market leader of *phone operating systems*.

More importantly, and relevant to your point: Both of these things aren't even the only or dominant revenue stream for both of those companies. Google in particular has an extremely diversified portfolio, to the point where even a major hit to Adsense isn't going to adversely affect their overall growth.How does apple not being market leader of phone matters? Don’t they make actually massive profits off their phones as compared to android manufacturers?If this is the information you're trading on, you're very mistaken on expectations. Please consider this comment for your own good:

&#x200B;

>Hell, Microsoft is still growing at 10%+.

The astronomical valuations these companies enjoy is because of their incredible growth. Any weakness there is punished. For example, even if a company is still "Growing" if growth is slowing compared to competitors. they will be punished.

This is true for MSFT, where they'r presently much smaller than AWS in the share of market so the market expects them to be growing much faster than their larger competitor if they're ever going to have a chance at beating them in a market that itself is expanding rapidly. The reason MSFT tanked is basically this. They had expectations to grow much faster in the cloud segment than they reported and that's very concerning given their investments in enterprise sales and positioning heading into a once in a lifetime opportunity where even the most hesitant customers have been asking about cloud solutions.

&#x200B;

>Apple isn’t even the market leader of phones, that’s Android.

"Not the leader" in what? Annual sales? Profit? Active devices?

In spite of not selling nearly as many devices as Android manufacturers do every year, there are over 1.2 BILLION Apple devices active at the moment, the majority being phones. This is simply because Apple devices from 5 years ago are still considered top of the line in tech specs when compared against their Android counterparts and still have support from Apple to update their software to the latest version every year.

The profit share of Apple devices over Android manufacturers is famous and you wouldn't have typed what you did if you were aware of this. They don't need to make a little money on every phone from a lot of phones, they make a lot of money on every phone from far fewer phones that last longer.

Apple is also the largest weight in the market. If the stock gets hit, the whole market goes with it.

&#x200B;

>Facebook IS social media which IS marketing 101 nowadays, if you want to grow your product you have to be on Instagram and paying influencers.

Well, the difference between a social network(s) like FB and IG that make money and Twitter that doesn't is the audience and ad products they have built up. That's outside the scope of this discussion since we're speaking about localized perf in time. And the advertiser boycott on FB combined with the complete shutdown of major economies thus  Small and Medium Businesses not having spending capacity as well + the symptoms we've already seen with diminished ad rates point to a temporary slowdown there as well. Now, im not saying they wont beat on earnings, but its very hard to do so.

&#x200B;

If any of these three companies has a bad earnings call you will see blood. We're seeing that now with MSFT and next week will tell us more about Apple and FB. The bright spot seems to be Amazon, but, just saying, your information seems very misplaced.Alright, I get it, I'll buy FGNUMicrosoft, Amazon, and Netflix - their earnings are skyrocketing. 

However, I am not sure about the rest of the gang - Google, Facebook, Apple. The first two make money from advertising and the advertising profits are way down. Many companies stopped advertising on Facebook until the end of the year, most local businesses not spending money on marketing at all (restaurants, cafes, movies and etc.). Logically, Apple's profits should go down as well, people postpone their spending until the crisis is over.Android is on OS not a companylmaoIs that a prediction? Because it can’t be an observation... Netflix is up 55% YTD.[removed]The N is for NvidiaTesla slumping. M.A.G.A it isHuh I couldn't tell till you said it. Content seems identical now.say what you want, but WSB can have some nuggets of truth amidst all the insanity.Because you can find something mildly funny, and also not be a homophobe.

It’s how the real world works.Got it. So AAL and CCL?VGT.Your can’t ban bitcoinAin't no love for BRK.B anymore?Silver, physical silverUndervalued stocks? Buffett just bought more BoA.Would China banning it matter much? At this rate they will be an islandWhy not bonds? It’s still got a ways to go to 0, and to have corporate bonds for better yields ontop of the classic mortgage backed bonds.

My 60/40 allocation only dropped ~8% when the market was 30% down. I’d argue that bonds did exactly their purpose and then some now that they’re up 7% YTD.VWUAXReal estate. Rental properties.Monero duhThis is like marrying the town bicycle because "who the fuck else will marry me?" It's not technically wrong, but it's also technically wrong. If the fundamentals are off on *every* vehicle we've got serious systemic issues and the *reasonable* play is to not play. None of us want to miss out though so we're all engaging in super high risk plays. We *are* going to end up being burnt. We just don't know when.Cash. I can't hold cash? watch me.At this point I consider buying MSFT the equivalent of buying bonds.

Despite it finally breaking $200 I can’t imagine not getting higher than 1% returns over the next 5 years even if you bought at the ATH.I've seen this a few times now, that Apple is smart for moving into the content space for margins, but Netflix, who's doing the same, is not going to continue growth. Now, you didn't say the part about Netflix in your comment, so why do you think Netflix is the weakest link, yet Apple will be fine with a higher-margin content creation?I miss me some blockbuster video. The carpet smell walking into the store .... *sigh the nostalgiaNitpick - Microsoft is not FANG and has never been.  It’s a blue chip stock.About your last paragraph, isn’t there a meeting scheduled to look into anti competitive behavior with the tech giants?Fang includes Netflix, which is not even a tech company, so it’s most a collection of “fast growing companies” analysis really liked 5 years ago.

If we are talking about companies that have horizontal integrations in its own ecosystem and compete across multiple sectors of tech, it would be Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Amazon, which complete across OS, mobile or tablet hardware, app stores, video streaming, gaming platform, cloud data centers, productivity suite,   chat client, email client, search, ad platform, single-sign in, and more.

Facebook only completes in a couple, while unrivaled in social media platforms, and Netflix doesn’t compete at all with these tech companies, but rather with Disney. 

In my eyes all four of these super-massive tech companies can thrive in the future, even if not all their bets pay off.  More importantly, nobody else (besides the two also dominant Chinese companies baba and Tencent, which also will also dominate China for at least decades) can come close to having enough money or engineers to compete for tech dominance across so many fields, so that moat is a tens of billion dollar moat.  A moat is very important for a company to survive decades, and there wasn’t any software tech companies with comparable power 20 years ago (except Microsoft, and they indeed survived).  

So I guess what I’m trying to say is I would invest in MAAG, MAGA or GAMA, not FANG.FAANG is an acronym for stocks that did good earlier this decade. Microsoft took off after the term was coined already. It doesn't just mean tech companiesWhat about the fundamentals of BA have you feeling like it will go back up? Their financials are in shambles and they just took $20 Billion in new debts (in the March/April timeframe). Is it the blind hope that they are too big to fail? Genuinely curious what you find so compelling.Haha,  you bought right after they went +10% for four days in a row? Don't feel bad, I sold literally the day before the spike I would have doubled down at $100.If that's what you're after, buy Tesla.Lol, your fucked if you think they're going to win that one. Once Tesla does Uber goes to 0Short term they'll be down- Dems are poised to win in Nov and have coalesced around a 10% defense budget reduction. Party platform comes out in August, so expect a drop at that timeAnd don't buy Raytheon just for the weapons manufacturing. They merged with United Tech which owns like a hundred companies. They're a big player in aerospace.How about the moon?War = deathNah WMT isn't caving.Breh go to wsbFair point.  WMT is at least in the realm of value and has some growth potential with their same day delivery plans.  

WMT has about same P/E as dollar general and cheaper than Costco's P/E.TSLA at 400 had a great risk/reward profile. At 1500+, not so much.I stuck the tip in to see how it feels and then realized ~~all~~ *most of* their ~~funds~~ *ETFs* are balls deep in TESLA.I’ll happily pay .75% for a 55% returnFair enough lolUber's ride hailing business is already very profitable with 25% EBITDA margins. It's the investment in self driving, Uber Eats and Uber Freight that weighs down consolidated profitability. As you saw with Grubhub and Postmates, Uber Eats has significant strategic value despite not being profitable so it makes sense to keep investing there.Aren't they buying Post mates?I remember reading this kinda statement about TSLA lolOh yeah? How?Once Tesla gets self driving they will be wiped outThat really was an early warning sign and intc surprisingly didnt drop much that day at all.Whisperings from inside Intel suggest that it is very poorly managed. There's plenty online about it having a completely toxic company culture the past few years direct from employees. It won't get out of the issues its having for probably another 5 years. When they get to 7nm, AMD will be on 5nm, maybe even smaller and likely offering better value in the process for customers top to bottom of the stack.

Intel does have a lot of impressive stuff going on elsewhere, and they can certainly throw their weight around while AMD can't, but I personally wouldn't be holding big on Intel right now. Dozens with far better outlooks for the next 5 years.

Intel is rapidly losing the mind share they've built up over more than a decade in the enthusiast market. These people then go on to heavily influence purchasing of laptops/office PCs of peers and often have an influence in the purchasing of infrastructure in many companies as those people tend to work in a technology field also. AMD have such killer products in both these categories that Intel can't get close to in value or even performance at the top end against a 64c Epyc.Yes, very biased. Intel is and had been a shit show for the past year. Tons of insider leaks showed a bleak future of their node technology.No youre quite right, intel has been trying to make their 10nm node work for years now, its 3 years begin schedule and is only now entering mass production, and then only for smal chips as they yield is crap. Then we have 7nm and its recently announced delays.

And while all of these problems have been going on they have stuck to the same architecture and not innovated on thast front either. Tht would otherwise be the logical thing to do ifbtiire stuck on a node. But no, we've been on skylake for 4 years.

With all of these problems its no longer unthinkable that Intel would go fabless, and their recent announcments that they re considering outsourcing confirm this.

At the same time amd is eroding their market share on all fronts, right now amd and Intel is almost at preformance parity, but amd Beata them in value all day long. The biggest reason as to why OEM's and server makers, data center planers are staying with Intel is their proven track record and reliability. There guys arent too fond of jumping onto new and unproven tech. I give it 2 years untill amd starts to seriously speed up their market share gains, especially in the high margin server buisniss. Thats if Intel doesnt release anything new and seriously competitive by then.I have to defer to you there, as I'm not as knowledgable on the subject.  The stock seemed priced for contraction...so it surprises me that mobile eye would be such a big deal to investors.

Any idea what intel wants to charge for their new 7nm line compared to AMD?  I think it's not only that they're gonna be slower to market, but I've thought more expensive too.

Intel does seem to have the lead in reliability brand and existing customer base.So what r u going to do? Keep holding for years? Have a target price that you will get out? I don’t see Intc hiring 60 again till late next year when maybe their execs say 7nm is back on track and is for sure launching in 2022. At this point, I don’t know how any analyst will upgrade. Stock might be stuck between 48-55 till end of 2021. 

The problem is opportunity cost. You see tsmc or nvda up huge for the year and you think. When the fuck is Intc going back to 55.Indeed - oil actually has a much better upside case than tobacco. 

[Oil usage has steadily increased since 2006, and even with covid only a slight drop in consumption is projected this year.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/271823/daily-global-crude-oil-demand-since-2006/)

Remember, we're talking about crude oil here, not coal. Crude oil's primary uses are not as easily disrupted as other fossil fuel commodities which, for example, fuel the grid. Electric vehicles will eventually displace lots of consumption, but it will be 10-20 years at least until major penetration.

There are many other differences, including pricing power in tobacco. But the way in which they are fundamentally similar is that Altria's market has done nothing but decline for 25 years. Not only that, but I picked the 25 year period for a specific reason: not only did it coincide with a secular decline in tobacco, it also started right during the worst of tobacco litigation.

I do not intend to suggest that oil is exactly similar to tobacco. I am merely reminding people that you could easily and rightly theorize a secular market decline lasting 25 years and still make money.Also, the tech is just very different between oil and renewables and so is the expertise. Companies just don't shift easily.Yup, a lot of this reminds me of blockbuster. Old men sitting in circles laughing at change thinking what they have will still work....That's like... The perfect time to "get big into options"lmao so me.... it's why i just dump money into ETFs regardless of where its at now.The real news would be whether other manufacturers would shift to arm as well. And I don't think that's unreasonable to expect.Yeah that's how I feel too. There's a lot of upside potential and even without growth in the stock price, it's a *really* solid dividend stock.Just realised I was thinking you were referring to NKLA, and gave my first comment with them in mind, not NIO. I guess the same applies though and NKLA is showing what happens when a knock-off TSLA is pumped just for being in the same market.So buy the dip, Trump will not allow for some sort of downward stock movement, that’s what matters most to him for reelection.The meeting will go something like,

How strong is their portfolio outside of mobile?iPhone is definitely Apples biggest money makerDid you know Samsung makes billions off of Apple every year from providing iPhone screens?Good question, it means they have plenty of room to grow as they convert android users to Apple/iOS users.I remember a few years back there was a year where Apple + Samsung combined made 103% of industry profits - because the rest of the industry combined took a loss.Why say more when you can say less? 

You don’t really have anything that disagrees with me, your point is “if growth slows”, but you’ve done nothing to prove your point.

I would argue none of them are monopolies like we’ve seen historically (standard oil, US steel, etc that President Teddy had to trust bust). They are also diversified. Fir example, people like to blame AMZN the most with e-commerce domination, but how can you fault them for being the first major player? There are still millions of websites to shop at. They also didn’t put mom and pop stores out of business. Sears, Macy’s, and department stores did 100 years ago. Then malls and big box stores. So that argument I hear often neglects the roadmap to modern times. AMZN smartly doesn’t dominate one field too much. It just has its hands in a variety of sub-industries.
I would say the same for MSFT, GOOGL, AAPL. Lots of diversity in their products. Netflix does streaming. I don’t see them anti competitive at all.

Nevertheless, there ARE legit concerns about these handful eating any up and coming threat. They do shady stuff to remain ahead. But they also are in bed with big government. Let’s not forget, the government uses their devices, services, servers/resources.Devil's advocate: There aren't many games in town. Despite the 737 Max disaster, Boeing still posseses some of the best talent in the industry. The main competitor, Airbus, is also bleeding cash. Boeing possesses strategic national importance, and will be bailed out to no end. Boeing will go back up in 3-5 years.Blind hope?

They are literally one of two companies on the planet that do what they do, and the only domestic one. Plus they do tons of defense stuff. 

BA isn’t going anywhere. Unless you have this blind hope that people are going to suddenly forget that air travel exists.Theyre the 2nd biggest defense contractor the government wouldn't allow them to fail it would be a national security issueI'm still majorly beating the market this year, so I can't complain. You can't win them all.Let’s be clear, I’m not after Uber or Tesla.  The comment was that Uber sucks as an investment and they see no path to profitability.  A path to profitability is Autonomous cars.  That doesn’t mean Uber has to ever beat anyone to the market on it.  In fact they’d probably find themselves profitable sooner if they focused on their core business, not trying to compete with automakers.  

I’m simply stating that a path for Uber to be profitable is to offer ride sharing without having to pay drivers.  You think Tesla is going to also corner the market on taxi and ride sharing when they develop fully autonomous cars?The new defense bill, this week, just passed both house and senate at $740B and heads to reconciliation about the nitty gritty

Idk why people keep saying Dems will cut - they just passed that behemoth with a veto proof majority

Not everyone is Warren and Biden, defense industry has its tentacles everywhere and China is on the rise. 10% cut is over $70B and that just isn’t happening

And again, the new bill passed effortlessly

> Senators voted 86-14 to approve their version of the National Defense Authorization Act on July 23. The House voted 295-125 to green-light its own bill July 21. Each package allows $740.5 billion in defense spendingI owned UTX--it was the first stock I bought way back in 2011 and never sold it. Raytheon and UTX merged into RTX then they spun off Otis (elevators) and Carrier (air conditioning + fire systems). That leaves RTX as aerospace stuff + defense contractor, which is fine. Maybe people are thinking "Boeing messed up planes! Air travel is down! Therefore everything with aerospace down!"Not wise. They're blowing up the moon for 4th of July next year: https://youtu.be/GTJ3LIA5LmANot for wealthy people.WSB jargon is funny in WSB, and totally obnoxious everywhere else.How would you have known that at the time?Not ARKF or ARKG.  Also like their IZRL.past returns are not indicative of future performance though. Barring TSLA how well have their other picks performed? You could replicate that yourself.It’s biggest holding is TSLA does that not worry you?I was with you until you said that Uber eats had significant strategic value.  What value is that you are referring to exactly?You are wrong.It trades on greater fool theory alone. Fundamentally the company is worth less than 0.Will they though? Ubers self driving tech is meant to be installed onto a modern car. Tesla’s self driving tech is meant to work only with their cars. I’d say even if tesla beat them to market, as long as Uber can get to market there’s no question which one would be betterTesla doesn’t have a platform of 11.5 billion daily active uses. They will have to build a massive public platform of billions of users. How are they going to do that?I worked for Intel until recently, and I can absolutely confirm that the company culture is incredibly toxic. They use up their employees and spit them out, don't even try to hide it. That being said, it's been like that for over a decade and they've still shown great profits. 

In terms of chips, again when AMD releases their 5nm chips they will be equivalent to Intel's 7nm, without a lot of the background architecture improvements. AMD's current 7nm are equivalent to Intel's 10nm, if you don't agree do a quick Google search. Intel is simply better in the architecture area and due to their limitations on 7nm they've had almost a decade to improve it behind the scenes. When those chips hit, they will be the best on the market by far, so they'll charge a premium. So Intel will probably own the market for the best data centers (like they currently do) and AMD will get the low cost ones. I was planning on holding until they finally release 7nm, then selling after that big jump. Now I'm not sure though.

Intel doesn't care much for the PC market. I assume they'll continue to phase out rather than lower chip costs.That's kind of where my knowledge starts to quit, but Intel is trying to exit the personal computer market since those chips aren't really profitable at the manufacturing cost anymore. I don't know what their new price point is, but I'd expect those chips to be largely targeted towards their data center business, meaning they'll be expensive.Reliability? With their 10+ security exploits discovered? I mean, physically, they’re fine. Security not so much.Electricity isn't replacing oil for shipping or planes. Plastic is all oil. Lubricants are all oil. A lot of chemical production is oil.

People spelling out the death of oil only think it's used for cars and that Tesla will kill it somehow.

Personally I think oil is undervalued right now is because we're one OPEC/Russia announcement away from negative oil futures... Once that risk dissipates oil will come right backI'm not 30 years old yet and even I'm cynical of the future of energy. US government is deeply interested in maintaining oil in a way that goes much deeper than coal.

So are the oil companies which carry pretty extreme lobbying power and will for the foreseeable future. Oil is neither Blockbuster nor coal.

I'd be interested to see which kinds of companies actually own a lot of future energy patents.Nah not when you bet big on MSFT gains.  I didn’t buy PUTSNot who you asked, but as someone that bought into VTIQ and then subsequently sold the resulting NKLA shares, I'll throw my 2 cents in on NKLA.

TSLA and every other BEV producer out there benefits from the energy used to power their vehicles having been produced and distributed for them on an infrastructure that's been in place for well over a century.

NKLA on the other hand have nothing. Hydrogen has no piping or trucking network. Plus say they want to produce it on site. There's an electrical grid out there for them to produce hydrogen on-site if they want-but making hydrogen takes a LOT of power. And Nikola have said they want to make their hydrogen green-with solar panels. So I ran some numbers.

Nikola have said they want to build truck stops that have a capacity of 8,000 kgs. Using electrolysis you need about 50-55 kWh to make one kg. Assuming they plan to be able to run through half of that hydrogen and replenish it in one day, 4,000 kg x 50 kWh = 200,000 kWh (or 200 mWh). Assuming you get a solid 8 hours of sunshine on your panels, 200 mWh/8hrs = 25 mW of solar capacity needed for *each* station-just to make the fuel.

Solar farms need anywhere between 5-10 acres per mW. I think you can see where this is going. 125 acres of land for one filling station is a little...ambitious, I think. Even if you cut that down to 2,000 kgs a day (which doesn't seem realistic to me. HFC cars take about 8 kgs to fill the tank. I can't find figures on how big the tanks are in Nikola's trucks, but assuming the same tank ratio of a typical economy car ~15 gal to the typical diesel truck ~200 gal, that puts their truck's tanks in the 110 kg range, which only gives you a capacity to service about 18 trucks a day), you'll still need 75 acres of solar panels to run it.

If they get less than a solid 8 hours of sunshine they're in trouble. If they need to produce more than 2,000 kgs of H2 in a day they're in trouble. It's much more likely they'll make *some* of their hydrogen with solar, but the vast majority will be made with energy from the grid.

I realize this is a lot more information than you're asking for, but it's what's been keeping me from holding NKLA shares. I own a PHEV myself and I've seen first hand how sparse the charging network is in the US (which is why I have a *PH*EV and not a *B*EV). And BEVs benefit from having industry giants like Duke Energy, TVA, ConEd, PG&E, etc all producing energy and distributing it for them, and retailers like EVGo, ChargePoint, Electrify America, Tesla themselves, et al manufacturing and installing the stations to dispense it.

And Nikola is going to build up this fueling network all on their own? I remain hopeful for them, but I'm just not convinced yet.Ding ding dingI remain proud of the 30 day ban I caught on this very subreddit in February for implying that Trump puts personal interest first ahead of whatever would be good for the country. 

I wore that sucker with pride. And now it seems everyone is routinely acknowledging that as fact, or perhaps whomever thought that observation ban-worthy has larger problems now.And then sell before the election because when a real Adult starts making decisions, the days of endless stock buybacks and corporate socialism are going to get, well they’ll still be around but it will be reigned in to some degree.Then why does he keep messing with China. Every time he does it the market goes down.What dip? FAANG?> Trump will not allow for some sort of downward stock movement, that’s what matters most to him for reelectio

I thought markets were supposed to be "forward" looking.  There's a greater chance of Trump dropping out of the race in the next month than him winning the election.They’ll get fined something like 2-3 months net income, grand scheme it’ll be nothing more than a government shake down. They need the money.I mean, Biden already said that corporate America needs to change its behavior but that he will not push any laws to do so. 🤷🏻‍♂️Didn’t realize Huawei was outselling Apple, but I would point out that these are completely different price ranges and profit margins. Apple is definitely the most profitable and also probably the biggest by revenue too - I think Huawei is selling a lot of low cost phones.Wow! Apparently I’m out of the loop when it comes to phones. Before the Huawei lady was arrested in my city & the whole scandal started making headlines I’d never heard of this company or noticed their phones for sale. 

I do have an old Google phone in a drawer somewhere.Incredible that people would buy chinese government sponsored phones.Yeah, the question is whether a hit to ad revenues would kill their potential as a company, especially enough to make the stock take a dive.Try 83%.*Decently* strong. 

They're the number one tablet maker in the world. 

Number one wireless headphone maker in the world. 

They make bank off their app store and music services — which admittedly, are highly dependent on the iPhone and iPad.

But...

Here's a question for you: What does a hypothetical "major hit to iPhones" look like?Their services segment is still in its younger years but heading for huge strength. Between Apple Card/Apple Pay, Apple TV and their MacBook/iPad lineup, they’re pretty diversified.Ignorance must surely be bliss. Read the data on that link again, see what I wrote and if you do indeed believe what you typed is true, well, I won’t argue.Yes, but “android” is actually a bunch of different phone makers combined. (Samsung, Huawei, Motorola, Nokia, Google Pixel, Xiaomi, ZTE, etc)

Apple is one of the biggest individual sellers and also selling the most expensive / high end phones.Letters can be easily rearranged to avoid FAAG - GAFA, GAAF, AFGA, etc. 

Also, FAANG is not about market cap and never was. It’s about growth, performance, and popularity.FAANG is just an acronym for stocks that did good early 2010s, and Netflix certainly belongs in that.

They’ve been pushing out competition and insulating and now they’re facing reverse racism (joke)That will change eventually, most likely by the time I finish renovation and ready my rental contract.You misunderstand.  I think Microsoft is a great stock.

FANG was created a decade ago when Microsoft was widely hated and nobody wanted to own it, since it was considered a zero-growth blue chip company like Pepsi or ATT. 

FANG literally stands for Facebook Amazon Netflix and Google.  Apple was added and it became FAANG but Microsoft has never been included in FANG.  People seem to be unaware of this, despite there obviously not being a “M” in FANG.

I think Netflix is a boring stock and not really tech, and people should stop using FANG when they mean Microsoft + Apple which both are literally not in FANG.Also commercial airlines make up 40% of their revenue.  A lot, to be sure, but it’s now like 100% of their revenue stream is being killed by the 737 Max disaster.  I also think they’ll pop when that gets cleared to fly again (which I think will be later this year in the U.S.)One share lolYou think Tesla is going to let Uber use their cars. Elon said he won't let any other ride sharing company use their cars.Well sure. A path to profitability would also be if they doubled their rates and didn’t pay the drivers more. Just because that’s a path doesn’t mean it’s a legitimate one. 

I see no legitimate paths to profitability.Uber eats bruhThe *next bill* comes out in July 2021 after the Dems take the Senate in November. Right now Dems are required to work with Republicans to advance anything in the Senate.

Now the Genomic revolution fund makes sense because CRISPR is their top holding.  

I just don’t wanna stick 10% of my funds in Tesla at this point in time.  I get why some people would at least until we see if added to S&P, but not me.

I don’t see how you can pass up on their long term profitsWhen people see a fucking car driving around without anybody in it, word will travel fastAMD are going to be more than a generation ahead though. They'll be on 7nm+ or even 5nm before Intel release their 10nm. A 10nm that's been filled with issues, I can't see clock speeds coming close to their current 14nm chips. So I can't see them holding much of a crown for single core performance, pretty much their only advantage right now. AMD are winning as they're offering more cores across the board for the same price. That's why they're cutting deep in high end servers. Epyc is a better product than anything Intel can offer, with better performance and less heat.

I agree PC's are a limited market and I don't think Nvidia or AMD want to be dedicated to it either, but again it's important because of the influence those regular users hold that trickles down to every sector.

I think [this](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3435727/two-amd-epyc-processors-crush-four-intel-xeons-in-tests.html#:~:text=ServeTheHome%20ran%20tests%20comparing%20the,28%20cores%20and%2056%20threads.&text=So%2C%20two%20Epyc%207742%20processors,much%20as%20the%20AMD%20chips.) proves my point about server performance

> ServeTheHome ran tests comparing the AMD Epyc 7742, which has 64 cores and 128 threads, and the Intel Xeon Platinum 8180M with its 28 cores and 56 threads. The dollars, though, show a real difference. Each Epyc 7742 costs $6,950, while each Xeon Platinum 8180M goes for $13,011. So, two Epyc 7742 processors cost you $13,900, and four Xeon Platinum 8180M processors cost $52,044, four times as much as the AMD chips.

> Nonetheless, the dual Epyc system racked up single- and multi-core scores of 4,876 and 193,554 points, respectively, while the quad Xeon Platinum 8180M system scored 4,700 and 155,050 points in the single-core and multi-core tests, respectively.>Electricity isn't replacing oil for shipping or planes. Plastic is all oil. Lubricants are all oil. A lot of chemical production is oil.

Plastics, lubricants and chemicals consume a fairly small amount of total production. Planes are not going to anything other than fossil fuels for most uses any time soon, the energy density required is too high. Shipping is probably amenable to other solutions, but ships will definitely consume oil for a long time to come.

The plurality of oil is consumed by light duty vehicles, and this is an area that is prone to disruption. But it won't be quick. And it won't be Tesla - it will be a cheaper, less luxury alternative in 10+ years.

>Personally I think oil is undervalued right now is because we're one OPEC/Russia announcement away from negative oil futures... Once that risk dissipates oil will come right back

I agree. A chunk of my portfolio is in energy stocks.I imagine this is because of the petrodollar.You spent everything on calls as your first play?Also wait for the first hydrogen vehicle accident it will make ice car accident look like a firecracker.  Hydrogen is the smallest atom so it will be much harder to contain than gasoline.
I just hope there isn't a problem at kbecof the storages.
Also alot of platinum is require for hydrogen vehicles so it will never reach mass consumer level use because platinum prices will go crazy if it does.That's some straight up clown shit if trueMaybe to a 1/2 degree. America loves greed, blue or red, we're floating this bubble until the "pop" is so big the whole world shuts down again.If you think Biden will pass anything with teeth when it comes to holding corporations liable, you're more delusional than the qanon folks.Yeah but even then, worst case is the big tech companies get broken up in some way. I think typically that holding the portions of the broken up company only leads to further share appreciation. That was the case with Standard Oil being broken up (Rockefeller made way more money from the broken up companies than just SO). 

To me, if they’re good companies and not clearly doing something illegal then it’s worth holding regardlessBiden has a fairly progressive platform but I haven't seen him say anything extreme on the subject. it depends how much he will listen to Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders if elected.It's time to eat you vegetables America and you're not going to like it.He used the china tariff war to manipulate the market up. Bad news on China dropped the market 100, but then a week later a tweet on great progress for a trade agreement.  Market then swings up 400 points.  I can't be the only one who sees this.  It benefits china too.Yeah, so his friends can short it. Then back up.

The shit murders small business not global behemoths.[removed]Doubt it, you’re fighting history.


Modern presidents are re-elected.That’s wishful thinking on your part. 

Did you see the Cato institute study?Likely. If that. Government is more starved for cash atm. 
The printers keep shrinking their own wallets. Even if it’s slowly.Imagine how much better Apple would do if they stopped price gouging customers.Well China itself isn’t exactly a small market. Plus, the people most likely to shop smart phones on price point are also less likely to have the time or inclination to research the company making the phoneWhat if, and I'm just spitballing here, say we had a major, global, long-lasting recession that worked its mass-layoffs through industry after industry in cycles, and everyone decides to buy the new $400 iPhone SE for the next upgrade cycle or two, instead of the $1200 iPhone that isn't noticeably better? Could that qualify as a "major hit to iPhones?"https://www.statista.com/statistics/742531/global-smartphone-production-volume-share/

Sure, but they still have market share they can take.Honestly, it was more about who was hiring the most top 1% engineers, initiallyGAFA is what's used in JapanYup they’re losing streaming rights as well and will be forced to create which is an expensive endeavor. 

Netflix is not a good hold imo even if it stands to gain 5-10% more in the next year or twoWhat’s U?They will do it if they feel like it is a big enough problem for money laundering \ black market goods.

You can't even carry or deposit $10,000 cash without being reported by banks. They won't introduce a bill larger than $100 to make money laundering difficult. That shows you where their priorities are long term.If bitcoin got banned it is likely that you could exchange it in a black market but there would be huge transaction costs due to the risk involved. Just like the price of heroin is highly inflated relative to the cost of production. Perhaps someone would want to skim 30% off the top to exchange your bitcoin for cash.Not a bad time to be renovating for sure. I've been thinking of rental properties as an investment in the future, but eviction suspension is a scary precedent. Best of luck!Not quite sure how he could legally do that in a free market system.  Elon says a lot of things but I certainly wouldn’t rule it out as a possibility.  And after they release a fully autonomous system, someone will copy it well enough in a couple of years so it wouldn’t have to be Tesla.I respectfully disagree.  There’s no question we’ll have autonomous cars in the near future likely from Tesla.  It seems investors in Tesla here believe they will do everything with their autonomous tech except sell cars equipped with it to another corporation while at the same time  preventing that tech from being copied by rival companies or countries.  Blue skies and all.

Unlike doubling rates, it is perfectly legitimate to expect a transportation company centered around technology would be one of the first to take advantage of this technology they already invest in.  That’s not being flippant, it’s a legitimate path.  Obviously the thing about tech like that is no one can predict the impact it will make.  The other redditor in this thread may be right and Tesla could be the only automaker and the only way to hail a ride in the not so distant future.  Or not.

I digress, but I’ve learned two things today.  Tesla bulls aren’t just riding until it’s added to the S&P,  they see it not just changing the world but some see it owning that change in every way for quite a while after.  Also, I’ve learned I have no desire to have a dispute with someone who can do [this.](https://imgur.com/gallery/UqKzQin)  Amazing work and best of luck with your investments.Ok... but the dem-controlled house passed it too. They’ve blocked military spending before, but chose not to this time. It’s a little deceptive to infer they only voted on it to work with each other, they could’ve just voted it down and caused furloughs like before. The dem-controlled house arms committee passed it unanimously during their phase

2013 was different geopolitics, before Russia invaded Crimea and before South China Sea crisis in 2016 and continuing China tensions

I have not seen any evidence that the 2022 defense bill will get cuts in spendingFully agree.  I won't touch anything with heavy TSLA weight until the volatility dies down.But you are assuming they end up the winner, which is far from certain.  They may likely be the losers in that race, especially considering their failed purchase of GrubHub.It’s only cheaper until the other one goes out of businessCheaper how?All good. Down voted the bull crap for ya and everyoneSo the numbers are....where? Profits in the last few quarters have come only from selling carbon credits. Tesla is an actual dumpster fire of cash. 

Your feelings don’t make a company profitable.Except for GameStop which underperformed yet I still had a worthless contract.  What happened was I had one successful contract then promptly bought 5 more or so then the pandemic hit.This has already been researched and tested: https://hydrogen.wsu.edu/2017/03/17/so-just-how-dangerous-is-hydrogen-fuel/ (scroll down to the 3rd photo in that article for the visuals on a comparison)

Spoiler: seems like it's not as dangerous as an ICE fire.[removed]Blue or red, we want green.I disagree. You gotta remember Biden is a old school democrat. Him and Obama were in hindsight criticized for not providing enough stimulus for the financial collapse...  but what can you do I guess. The previous administration was much more fiscally conservative than the Trump administration and I think that will continue with Biden. Rather than providing bailouts to businesses I think we’ll actually see an infrastructure plan for once. Put people to work, start generating way more clean renewables and lessen the geopolitical influence that shit countries like Saudi Arabia have over us.the culture war nonsense has been cranked to the maximum, which I guess effectively serves the purpose of obfuscating that there's little daylight between the two parties when it comes to reining in corporate interests, at least imho, anyway. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯No one is more delusional than qtards.Am I? Cause the main reason we haven’t gotten the phase 4 stimulus yet is because republicans are holding firm for liability protection for business who are putting their workers in harms way. 

Democrats are vehemently opposing that inclusion atm.

It's not like they are some cheap iPhone knock off company. The P40 Pro is a great phone.Services cost the same no matter which model you have, so the diversification helps. Also, do you think the SE will purely cannibalize existing iPhone owners, or can they gain some market share from android by having a relatively premium phone at a decent price point?You’re betting against American consumerism. That’s a bet I’m not willing to take.I mean, it's a really good question. That's how I imagine it would go down as well — it's not like people would stop buying phones, they'd just stop buying the flagship ones. 

I don't have an answer for you. I don't think it would trash the fundamentals of the company though, y'know? You'd just see more differentiation in the lower end rather than where you currently see it, in the high end.

Would it really tank the stock?If you are saying Apple will probably keep growing, then I agree.> Yup they’re losing streaming rights as well and will be forced to create which is an expensive endeavor.

Did you submit this comment from 2017? Netflix has been focused on original content almost exclusively for years now. The writing was on the wall re: licensing almost immediately after they transitioned to a streaming business. 

Netflix is not going away.UberHere's my prediction, hope you jump on the train like I [did](https://imgur.com/gallery/Ldq6XSf) with options. Tesla will be able to pull of self driving because of all the data they are collecting. Once they release self driving there is going to be a HUGE moat for competitors to cross in collecting data. Let's day Amazon tries to do it by equiping their delivery vehicles with cameras to collect data. It will take a couple years, by that time Tesla would have already scooped up their logistics business by under cutting them on transportation.Not sure how legal it would be, but since Tesla would run the software, to say put it in self driving mode and then go somewhere you have to interact with the Tesla system, which would automatically charge the rider in order to work. You’d have to pay double to get Uber on top.


I think that seems like something that Tesla could do- we write the software, you buy the upgrade, and this is how it will work if you want the upgrade. Maybe to get around that you have to manually put it in free mode for friends and family which would be annoying to do just to work for UberThanks! That was a fun quarantine project.Furloughs during an election year is a poor strategy.Yea they could end up a “loser” but that’s why I said it has strategic value. The “loser” in the UK was HungryHouse (Just Eat and Deliveroo beat them) yet HungryHouse was acquired for a huge multiple. DeliveryHero was the “loser” in Germany but they sold that business to Takeaway.com for a huge premium. Grubhub and Postmates were “losers” in the US and still had significant value to an acquirer. So my point is Uber Eats has significant value despite no earnings contribution. Uber is worth significantly more on a sum of the parts basis than it is todaySome other VC funded business might take its place.Some restaurants have free delivery on Ubereats and the delivery price is cheaper compared to Menulog.They are reinvesting everything into factories. Go to google and search up AMZN analysis, set search criteria to the year 2002. Articles will pop up from analysts criticizing amazon for not being profitable and building useless “factories”. Where are they now. Tesla is building an extremely powerful foundation. They’ve already become a household name and the hottest item on the market to purchase is a Tesla.Your submission has been automatically removed because the URL matches one on the /r/Investing banlist due to low quality content.

But if we go full blown recession then cannibalization may actually become an issue. Thank God their services revenue is heading in the right direction.You know, the hypothetical above is the rational side of me. But it seems like the answer to our problems these days is more credit. After all, who wouldn't buy a $1200 phone when you can just finance it over 48 months? So, i think you're probably right. Well find a way to let everyone borrow their way out of this mess, and then we'll inflate away the debt.In normal times I think it would tank the stock. I think people buy Apple stock because of the sales margins. With how the market has behaved the past three months though, I could see it accelerating the growth because now "Android has competition in the low end!!" 🤠I’m not saying it will crash, but the growth will stall tremendously. Disney+, Hulu, HBO, etc. The competitors have matched up. Netflix is trading an extreme premium that is simply not justified given the lack of moat or growth prospects. It’s done.Ehh that’s iffy man. Only Ubereats is profitable rn. 

I’d throw in some $$ there though. The working model that would make ride sharing profitable benefits Tesla more.Wow what were your plays? And since you’ve been long Tesla what’s your opinion on stock price movement over the next quarter?I guess we’ll see in November, I just don’t see the dems as that innocent in military spending. I thought it was deceptive to dangle the base name change out there as a win while pushing the dollar amount for the bill under the rug. All I’ve seen from Biden is that we have to spend smart but no confirmation on what that means

Regardless Raytheon should be great long term, their depressed valuation is entirely from the Pratt and Collins sides of the company which depend on commercial. They’ll be leading the hypersonics pack and that’s one of the more important programs going forward. If there’s an election dip I’ll load up on shares

L3Harris is another one that makes key high tech equipment that would also be entirely budget cut resistant. Kratos is another that’s heading into autonomous drones which won’t get cut but I think it’s about to get gobbled up by LockheedI doubt that Uber would be able to spin off their eats segment for enough to make up for the lost cash flow in the event of them not having a successful food delivery business.  I don't have Postmates numbers revenue numbers but Uber is buying them for 2.65 B.  Q4 Uber eats lost 461 M, and their losses are accelerating.  They will burn as much cash as they spent for postmates in less then 2 years.  Not sure anyone is going to pay more for that business segment than the cash they would have burnt through to build it.Not even close to comparableTSLA is being propped up by selling carbon credits. The business is otherwise unable to make money. Your feelings do not matter, this is fact.Stanky armi will not be so sure about that.

In Asia, Netflix is the de facto leader in movie streaming business. In fact, Netflix has gone so far as working with Indonesia government to have their content aired in the most conservative government TV channel, and then some.

The word "netflix" itself has become its own verb almost synonymous with "google" in the early age.

That said, i am not convinced about its stock price though. Seems high, but the prospect of the business is still as good as ever.I'm still holding 10 1200 June 2021calls even though they dipped hard the past 2 days. Next quarter flat, but sometime around Q4 I honestly believe a full self driving will be released for Tesla. Expect stock price to hit 5000-6000. Once at this stock price, they dilute the stock by selling shares in order to gain capital for  more factories. Shit you usually do, like go to grocery store say bye bye cause you can get food cheaper delivered straight to your door. Once they have people getting food delivered, why not toilet paper clothes. What ever you want. Like Amazon Tesla hand will be dipped into everything but at much more efficient level with the self driving tech.80+ P/E is not simply worth it. Like I said, if I’m thinking in terms of buying and holding for 10+ years, Netflix ain’t in that club.How much was your initial investment?Also I think full self driving is years away.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*RH seems to be unable to follow regulations.  The UK probably asked too many questions so they ran.They are a private company so it's hard to say the reason.

In the USA all major brokerages are commission free, have fractional shares so a lot of increase in competition.

However RH seems to still be the most popular choice for new traders or younger people because I guess the interface is good?

It's gotten some criticism for allowing new traders to trade options and complex options strategies to brand new traders who do not understand how options work.Yep, most likely because UK has much stringent regulations which RH fails to meet.The UK and the rest of Europe have extremely tiresome regulations that make it difficult for retail investors to gain access to US securities (particularly ETFs). In fact, I don't even think you can open a TDAmeritrade account in the UK and other platforms like Schwab and Interactive Brokers block their clients from trading US domiciled ETFs, which are cheaper and have far greater liquidity than EU/Ireland domiciled ones. 

Even with Brexit, I don't think they're going to roll back these regulations so it makes sense that brokers don't want to operate there. Having said that, I don't think people are missing out on much. Robinhood is an crap broker.They weren't even offering Options because of UK laws so I didn't really see what they had over Trading 212 or other low/no commision brokers.RH canada maybe? ;)The sheriff of nottingham must be relieved to hear this news.I received the same email a moment ago. To be honest I'm kinda glad, Robinhood is an awful platform for so many reasons.

They pride themselves in as a company that enables the masses to invest, yet they take absolutely no responsibly in the mindless risks they allow uneducated investors to take.

They also have a really bad track record when it comes to uptime and software bugs.

It's crazy to me that they haven't come under more scrutiny. They're giving the entire industry a bad name at the moment.As alternatives we have Trading 212, Freetrade, Hello Stake, and Revolut.

The order I wrote them is my order of preference, Trading 212 being the highestUse Freetrade if you’re in the UK it’s basically the same even looks the same from what I’ve seenTastyworksFuck, I was waiting for this. What do I use now as a britbong?Brexit related. The UK is no place for an International business.Unresponsive company not yet learned to be a better service provider.They just closed a financing round. If you're pessimistic, you might think that's more than coincidence.UK investors are more cautious and rh has bad name in wsb[deleted]What would be the equivalent trading platform in europe? I use revolut but they only allow trades in the NYSE.[deleted]Buy $AMTD?[deleted]I got this email too. I was really looking forward to being over-leveraged.Terrible customer support. solely on email and no way to followup tickets except reply.We really need some free or at least cheaper brokerages here in Finland. We have to pay insane commissions here. Nordnet which is quite popular takes 15€ commission to buy or sell US stocks.Man I live in the US and use RH to invest in companies.  Is RH that bad?? Should I make a switch?Will they ever come to Canada? Anyone know anything?Lol thank god. Less people will lose money because of itHave they already given up on the Australian launch?If anyone catches anything from this- this is the START.  Get your running gear on or grab your binoculars.This is pretty disappointing, if RH are unable to bring their service to the UK then it makes it all the more unlikely that other brokerages will as well such as Webull and TD. 

This in turn makes it impossible for anyone in the UK to trade US ETFs and ETNs.I would like them to mature a bit. If they offered IRAs they would keep smarter clients, I think. They certainly do need to focus more on the US since their product just isn't there yet. And while their interface is nice, anyone could copy it.

There are some oddities. Name any other brokerage that has an article about Karl Marx on its website. They're all over the place.If there is no Robin Hood, how are people in the UK going to get a free brokerage whereby Goldman Sachs front runs their orders and closely monitors their stop-loss limits?I guess you could say that they couldn't stand up to the Sheriff of Nottingham.I wonder if Brexit is playing a role in making it difficult to enter the UK market.[removed]Did they ever fix that infinite leverage bug that a WSB user abused?> In the USA all major brokerages are commission free, have fractional shares so a lot of increase in competition.

Did not know this, so basically the only thing they offer is a easy to use mobile app, which is a big selling point in this day and age tbf.Their interface is by far the simplest when it comes to trading on mobile> It's gotten some criticism for allowing new traders to trade options and complex options strategies to brand new traders who do not understand how options work.

I still don't understand how this is the fault of the platform.>They are a private company so it's hard to say the reason.

Here's one of their top concerns: how do we still open up options trading to teenagers that don't understand the complex math behind options, without them commiting suicide and our company becoming exposed to public outrage and congressional regulatory risk?Any idea why we don't have comission free trades in Europe? Sick of paying $1 everytime I buy a share of Microsoft or Apple.It's also got a great name.In terms of new users, I also think RobinHood has just done an excellent job of marketing themselves.  I don't hear the ads as often now, but I listened to so many podcasts and youtube channels that were having ads for RobinHood during the last couple years.

The clean interface and stuff definitely helps, but I think their marketing is the biggest reason.  It actually sort of got me interested in investing even though I ended up at Fidelity.The interface is just easy to digest for people who are green at this>are commission free, have fractional shares

I've been testing out a number of companies here lately and I just can't seem to settle on one. The UI either looks dated on some platforms, they don't have a proper mobile app, have yet to add fractional shares (TD), etc.

There are a few of the more online-focused ones (M1 Finance, Robinhood, Webull) that I just feel strange transferring my entire portfolio to these new companies. So I've just been testing them with a few hundred in each.Fucking MIFID2. I cannot believe the fucking knuckle-dragging shit-for-brains in Brussels thought it was a good idea. They can’t have involved a single CFA when they passed that fucking garbage.Euros to busy trying to put reporters in jail who try to expose fraud. Just look at wire cardI am aware of two suicides from their optional trading and lack of control. First time investors many barely turned 18 started with PUTs and CALLS.  50 Call contracts here and 20 Puts there often with their parents or school tuition money. I think one needs to be at least 21 to gamble but can do it online through stocks younger. Some parents seem to endorse it.> they take absolutely no responsibly in the mindless risks they allow uneducated investors to take

i think there's some level of personal responsibility needed there - sure the UI can be clearer, but the investor needs to educate themselves, rather than expect that the platform prevents them from doing stuff just because it's risky.

> bad track record when it comes to uptime and software bugs

i would agree they need to up their game in this aspect. Cannot trust a brokerage that falls over at the hint of volume.>They pride themselves in as a company that enables the masses to invest, yet they take absolutely no responsibly in the mindless risks they allow uneducated investors to take.

Yea I think opening up option trading to anyone is a bit irresponsible . When I first started learning about investing (I never "traded") no one was talking about options except serous traders. If you told me in 10 years college kids would be trading options on their phone during class I would never have believe you.

Also like 10 years ago I wanted to try selling some covered calls and I had to call my brokerage (scott trade) at the time and answer a bunch of questions on options, terminology , risks before they let me have access. I also had more than 25k+ in my account so it wasn't a day trading thing, even then they only gave me level 1 options . They said after a few months they probably could get me level 2.

Now RH lets a user open an account , get level 3 options no questions asked.If you lose all your money trying to buy options, thats YOUR fault, not RH.Please excuse me as I m not in a region that can use Robinhood either but 

>take absolutely no responsibly in the mindless risks they allow uneducated investors to take.

Isn't this like complaining that casinos don't take responsibility for their uneducated gamblers?Yeah especially when that guy killed himself when he saw it said -700k, but it was just a bug on robinhoodIs a company responsible to protect us from ourselves? I posit: No.

Dumb people do dumb things, from investing to walking across streets.well everyone is already saying this, but Robinhood shouldn't be taking responsibility for uneducated investor's mistakes. Like absolutely zero. dont understand how you can even make this argument.> They pride themselves in as a company that enables the masses to invest, yet they take absolutely no responsibly in the mindless risks they allow uneducated investors to take.

Is this based on the option hacks where you can use money you don't have? 

Maybe FreeTrade doesn't have this reputation because they don't do options, and they only do market orders (one of the reasons i'm not a fan tbh).It always rubbed me the wrong way how they framed it as if the biggest barrier to novices investing was the platform used for buying and selling. 

If you’re putting more effort into opening an account somewhere than picking stocks then you probably should’t be doing it.I’m disappointed. I feel RH has made trading far more accessible and affordable for millions of people. I don’t think we should be blaming tools when it’s really people misusing these tools.I’m not 12. I don’t need a brokerage coddling me.  I hate how recently everyone wants to be supervised. Killing freedomWhat do you think is the best alternative? In the USI mean at a certain point, adults have to take responsibility for knowing things or not.Whats a good alternative to robinhood in the UK?Revolut are more of a bank-account-with-benefits dealio aren't they?What's so good about Trading 212?I use Trading212. My only gripe was I was always a little disappointed with the number of stocks they offered, but it sounds like they’re doing shit internally and are going to be adding a ton of new tickers next month. I won’t post a referral as I’m not sure it’s allowed but I can send you one if you dm me? Is that allowed? I don’t know.DeGiroIGTell that to all the international businesses still in the UKIt will take a while still before London is not considered financial capital of Europethat's like saying Uniqlo has a bad name in /r/FrugalMaleFashion.> has bad name in wsb

How ever will I put on my short TSLA position now?I'm guessing they'll be laid off now.According to the FT they're being moved to support US operations which seems fairly sensible imo. Although I imagine the majority of their UK staff would be people more involved in the legal and deals side of things (seeing as the app is already there), so I doubt they'll all be kept onSo the google customer service approach applied to trading stocks?Try with Trading212I’m pretty sure it was announced 5+ years ago.What's front running? Does it mean placing themselves at the top of the order book so that they get the best price?

(I'm a finance major so I feel I should know this lol)There are free brokers in UK but they have limited universe of equities. I was hoping RH would bring options trading instead.it's probably citadel, not GS tbfIt's called Freetrade. It's live already.That question only has one answer no matter what the business is.Yes.

Yes it is.Suddenly the UK market looks pretty shitty when it doesn't get you access to the nearly ten times bigger EU market.Your submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

Other brokers had to let go of trading fees in order to stay competitive, because of Robinhood.Easy app - yes.  But to cut costs, they have no customer service phone number.  So imagine if your account was hacked and you had to email them and wait for an email response.  

Also, I don't get why most brokerages in the UK still charge commission.  I thought the capital markets would be as competitive in the UK as in the US.They got most of their userbase before other companies started offering free trades.

AFAIK the EU still has a lot of firms with comissions per trade -- so robinhood would probably force them to 0 to compete, just like the US.  Too bad for EU traders they arent coming in, even if you don't use them they smashed the commission trading model.Pretty much although I really do not like there mobile app , however a lot of people seem too.

They still seem to be popular and attracting new users ; however lots of users have also moved on to fidelity/schwab/TDAWe have commission free trades in Europe, trading 212, free trade, revolut$1 seems pretty good compared to the $5 trades we have in Canada.Trading 212!because you didnt have robinhood.

In the U.S. we had ~5 dollars per trade from most major brokerages until robinhood offered commission free trades.

The other brokerages saw robinhood eating their lunch, and all cut to 0 about a year ago.

The same would probably happen in europe, except robinhood i guess isnt moving inBecause Europe is not a country. It would cost a lot of money to adhere to multiple countries' tax laws and regulations.In Europe it is free on Revolut platform for 3 trades/month, even fractonal stocks. After that 1$ per order.I have no clue I could guess but I probably would be wrong.

My guess is just competition and market size. The usa is just a bigger market so firms want to compete more for the market.  Maybe there are tax and regulatory issues too.

I think most people in europe can open an account with an american brokerage (you may need 25k) and trade stocks on the USA exchanges commission free; however you always have to exchange your currency to USD.

Interactive brokers is also available almost everywhere but I think you have to generate $10 of commission per month or pay the difference .RH was the first brokerage started the war. If trade is free what else can one ask?  However, the rebate from different 3rd party causes slower execution completion. No service. All had to be eMailed. Schwab started discount service you phone in they charged $35 while others charged 3 figures for execution.This is the ignorance the brokers are feeding on. No trade is free, even without a commission. The broker gets a cut of the bid ask spread on every trade. You're paying, you just don't see it.Funny how American ETFs are so dangerous to invest in but Forex and CFDs with a gazillion leverage  is a-ok.So much this. Such bullshit...I think more responsibility is needed from both sides to be honest. I agree that primarily the fault is with the individual who took excessive risk, but it's also true that many users trading options on Robinhood have no idea what they're doing.

My broker, Degiro, requires I complete a questionnaire before I can access more advanced products like options and futures, for example. It's nothing difficult so long as you know what you're doing, but it ensures users have a basic understanding of the products they're trading and the risks involved.

Robinhood on the other hand makes you feel like you've unlocked a new level on a game...Well that is casinos' business model reallyTo be fair, it wasn't just 'a bug on robinhood'. The other half of his trade hadn't executed. Robinhood should have a pop-up disclaimer for traders in these instances. (They may have it now, I'm smart enough to know I shouldn't be messing with options so I don't know.)I think that guy was already suicidal to begin with. Like if I saw -700k on my account I would investigate it, not fuggin kill myself. Subconsciously the -700k could have been his way to get off this Earth.

I'm not saying Robinhood should be absolved of their failure to educate the user, I'm just pointing out that no sane person would commit seppuku over that. And within the timespan that the order didn't even finish execution.Personal responsibility and ethical business practices are not mutually exclusive.  By your logic we should just let tobacco companies advertise to children and make seatbelts optional for car manufacturers.

Robinhood deliberately designs their user experience to prey on people with gambling tendencies and lure uneducated investors.  Not illegal but not ethical either.Ehhh

Minimum wage/child labor laws exist for this reason. 

We do need some levels of protectionLegally, I agree with you, but ethically I think Robinhood shares some responsibly.

It's always irresponsible companies like Robinhood that spark calls for regulation. If we continue to see stories about retail investors being harmed by Robinhood then the whole industry is going to suffer.On Reddit, personal responsibility isn’t really a thing. Nobody in a bad situation can be blamed. It’s always some corporation/politician’s fault.Well, first off, I don't think they should have any legal obligation to keep their customers safe -- although I know a lot of people do think that. For me it's an ethical problem I have with their platform.

It's an app designed for inexperienced investors so why do they automatically open a margin account with every sign up? Can you see how this is a little irresponsible? It's like your bank giving you an interest free loan when you sign up for them. Sure, you're stupid if you spend it, but why are they tempting their clients with that in the first place?

I could name a few things like this that RH does which directly increase the risk that their clients will take risks they don't fully understand, and again, I don't think any of it should be illegal, but that doesn't mean I morally agree with it.

What I think they should do is what a lot of brokers do and offer a pro platform and a basic retail investment platform. Most people on RH just want a cheap, easy way to buy and hold stocks. Those who want to play around with options or trade on margin should be fine with a small fee or commission if it means a more reliable platform.

What RH does is couple a retail investment platform with professional trading products which puts amateur investors just learning about the market at needless risk. Legal or not, it doesn't mean it's right.Just go straight to IB. It’s got a steep learning curve but it will grow with you. It will also force you to spend some time researching what you’re doing. Robinhood is like modding your toddler’s trike to go 100mph. You *can* do it but *should* you?Degiro, or for more experienced investors IB.Yeah, something like that, it's an electronic money account and not a "bank account" so it's not FSCS protected.

I use it for payments in other currencies like EUR + USD so I don't use it a lot but I like the app.

The invest is really basic and on the free plan you only get 3 free trades a month.

There are other reasons I don't recommend them from news I've heard about company culture and employment methods.Commission free, easy to use but still feature rich, available as an ISAAye I’ll dm you buddyReally liking trading 212. Find there pc interface a little lacking but mobile is really good.Lots of people sleep T212What's wrong with Degiro?They already know.Well if you are long term investor, then rh is fine.How do they make money if it's commission free?[deleted]Pretty much  


I had sent emails every day awaiting a response. I only received auto-replies with an eta date of 3-5 days. 2 weeks and a half later and I was done with waiting. I live in the bay area so I traveled from s. san Jose to Menlo Park up the peninsula. Came to the building; it's a Small little adobe looking building, no one's parked there (COVID-19) so I was stopped by security and was requested to sign a complaint letter. The next day I got a reply and had issue fixed bug concerning the withdrawal of funds.A retail investor puts a buy order in... big wall street firm comes in with high-frequency trading and buys before them, pushing up the price. Now they have to pay a higher price to buy and they have gains.

On the downside, the high-frequency trading platforms can see all the Robinhood stop-loss orders. So they create artificial selling to cause a cascade of stop-loss orders to hit. The goal is to push the stock price down, then they buy back in at a lower price.If you are a finance major and have a general interest in computer networks or finance then have a read of Flash Boys. Also front running is what HFTs do.You'd enjoy the book flash boys. Just finished it. It's about this subjectIt's the exploitation of order information delay by the big boys.Front running used to mean literally running in front of someone, and that's the easiest way to understand it: here's a slightly over-simplified example

Imagine I'm stood next to you on a trading floor and I hear you on the phone to a client: "Okay Joe, you want to buy 500 of BankCorp? No problem, I'll get on that for you"

I know you're about to go buy 500 BankCorp, which will push the price up a bit - so I run to the counter ahead of you (literally front-running) and buy some BankCorp of my own. Then when you get to the counter and buy some, the price goes up and I can sell to you for a little more than I paid.

Now imagine if you're the exchange running the orders... every time someone buys, you could buy first and then sell it to them for slightly more, making a little sliver of profit on every purchase.so do you guys have any free options platforms available?

What about Tastyworks?Revolutroll on CANZUKI realize that most people here are very new to investing and tend to think that's an accurate statement, so I'm sure there's going to be plenty of angry comments in my inbox after this, but that isn't remotely true. 

Commissions have been steadily declining since May day in 1975 with the removal of the price fixing requirements.  Reaching zero was a logical endpoint, they'd fallen from nearly $40-60 per trade in the 70s down to $20 in the 90s, $10 in the 00's, and sub $5 all well before Robinhood was a thing.  Charles Schwab(the person) had said his eventual goal was to get commissions down to 0 decades ago. 

And frankly Robinhood's model doesn't work.  It's not a profitable company.  There had been zero commission brokers before and they all failed as well because nobody figured out how to make it sustainable - from that standpoint Schwab and Fidelity have really lead the way in changing the brokerage platform to one that can sustain profits from things like fund management and NIM without the need to push commissions.  The entire reason why the TD deal happened is because they weren't ready for zero commissions and everyone else was.  RH can continue to burn VC cash for a while so it's of little consequence to them but let's not pretend like Schwab, Vanguard, and Fidelity have been shifting their revenue streams for decades towards management fees and NIM because of a broker that just started.  
  
Also, to be quite frank, Robinhood largely caters to a trader that isn't profitable for most brokers.  They hold low amounts of cash but trade often and don't care about spreads much - this is how they're able to generate significantly more cashflow from order flow than other firms.  

Crediting robinhood with creating the current commission environment basically ignores everything that's happened in securities regulation and brokerage structure from the 70s till today and instead just presumes that there wasn't already downward trajectory in fees prior to like 2016.  I get that people who just started investing in the last few years, likely with Robinhood, might not be aware of all of these things so there's that, but IMO it's somewhat absurd to credit them here.  It's like saying they were the reason your team won the game when they showed up to the stadium with 2 minutes left, and made a field goal while your team was already up by four touchdowns.  The only way you could think that is if you only turned the game on with a minute and a half left.the first broker to remove fees is charles schwab. i love t he fake news from ppl - ppkl who dont know shit act like they know.yepYup this happened to me it was a very large pain and the reason I don’t use them for any new purchases.Do they offer trading on other markets than the US? I mean, can American buy stocks on the European exchanges?EU already has plenty of commission free trading platforms. They made it cool sure, and the app was a big part of that, but it's not like we don't have alternatives. FreeTrade is one for example.I used Robinhood when everyone else wanted 4.95 per trade. It was great and they forced everyone to drop down to 0 commission trading. With everyone at 0 I can name a lot of brokerages I'd use as my main investment/IRA account before I'd ever use RH though.Moved to Schwab last year during the RH infinite leverage fiasco and could not be happier. It's like graduating from kindergarten to college.With my Swedish broker I pay $1.40 to buy 1 share of MSFT and $7.90 to buy 10 shares. (Currency change sucks). It's basically a flat fee + percentage for currency.
$5 is just insane lolI have been using it, and so far I like it. Only 'downside' is that they don't offer options, which is why many people were waiting for RH, I believe.It's mostly EU-wide regulation. His point is not invalid.It would be illegal for the brokerage to not give you the best price they can find, they have a legal obligation to act in your interests.

And unless you are using a specific broker, most of them are not market makers, and do not make money off of the bid ask spread.

They make money off of selling order flow information.Right!? Don’t you dare invest in VOO but go right ahead and invest in leveraged forex CFDs with unlimited downside.I'm not familiar with any other brokers but im curious, what other features do they have that Robinhood doesn't that would reduce risk?I really wish degiro had access to nyse american options. Their selection isnt greatquestionnaire ? that anyone with half a brain can google and find out the answers to . That is your answer for making investors more responsible ?I agree, I would try to get a hold with someone from the company that can help me understand what's going on.Sorry, I want a brokerage firm. Not a nanny telling me I cant do things for my own goodNice, I opened my DeGiro account years ago, maybe it's time to look again since there are new players. 

Had a quick look at their website is nice, very detailed.Not commission freeExtra’s but they also sell the orderbookThey also make money by offering CFDs, so I believe them offering 'free' investing works to get more people into the platform, and if some get into CFD trading because of that, they will make money.[deleted]That’s pretty epic that you showed up at the office. Im impressedIt sounds more like blackmagic fuckery than investing these days. Who are the best brokers in your opinion. I'm about to hit the casinoI wonder if anyone can see your stop loss orders? Maybe only your brokerage but not entirely sureThanks for coming back! Some follow-up questions:

>they create artificial selling to cause a cascade of stop-loss orders to hit.

How is this selling 'artificial'? Are there not real positions changing hands?

> The goal is to push the stock price down, then they buy back in at a lower price. 

Is this not market manipulation? How is this legal?Neither of these features sound like they should be legal, but I guess it's a non issue to the SEC?Oh my god is that what's happened to me a few times. This happened to me a lot with JETS contract buysI believe your can open tastyworks and IB but funding the accounts is a bit of a pain. We are just getting free stock dealing. Not sure if we will ever get options trading in UK let alone free options trading.You’re right on all accounts, but its also worth noting that Schwab, Vanguard, Fidelity, etc. have other businesses outside of their self-directed brokerage platform.  Their revenue streams are much more diversified over TD, E*Trade, or Robinhood.

I’ve heard that Robinhood is profitable now, except their CAC is way too high, thus the requirement to keep raising funding.  They’re still in a massive growth phase, as weird as that sounds considering their 13M customers.  They have to keep growing as their average balances are likely $1-3k per customer, and as you said with little to no cash.  

That being said, they raised $600 M in the past two months.  I would bet anything they are putting together a managed investment product, which has a much higher margin than brokerage.Schwab set a goal in the 80's, that still hadn't been met 30+ years later until RH became popular with the public.  This caused other established traders to ask why they're still paying fees per trade, despite, as you said, a promise that zero fees were coming decades ago.  Why do I need this expensive brokerage when I can I use RH for free? Just as Tesla didn't invent the EV or even perfect it, they brought it into the public conscience and changed the market from that.  

I'm not saying RH is great, or even good, but without them or another like them gaining popularity, the brokers have zero incentive to remove trade fees.  I also don't think they'll have much issue monetizing when the time comes.  Offering competitive rates for paid services along with ad revenue can sustain their low overhead operations just fine once they've established in a market.  It's not like they have huge customer service teams or really any human elements that you get at traditional brokers.  And I don't think that will matter too much for the generation of customers growing up now.I mostly agree but do think they were the straw that broke the camel’s back, which is worth something.>The entire reason why the TD deal happened is because they weren't ready for zero commissions

A while ago before schwab cut commissions to zero Chuck(or their ceo can't remember) hinted there may be acquisitions in the future and said they thought there would be consolidation in the industry , and re-stated their goal of zero commissions. A few months later they announced zero commissions and then a few months after they were buying TDA

Part of me think TDA was an acquisition target for a while, they announced zero commissions and knew TDA would be in trouble, and maybe more open to a takeover after they cut commissions to zero.  


EDIT

I didn't see your other comment basically confirming this> I realize that most people here are very new to investing and tend to think that's an accurate statement, so I'm sure there's going to be plenty of angry comments in my inbox after this, but that isn't remotely true.

In textbooks, Robinhood is consider a "mover" for causing change among the brokers. The oil industry is well aware of alternative energy and claim they will make that transition, but haven't done so. It's the same exact shit among brokers that you wrote, it took an outsider to force change. I don't care if they talked about $0 commissions decades ago, they didn't act because they felt they can squeeze more out of the retail investor.

RH saw it and capitalized. fyi I absolutely plan on jumping from RH to TD soon so don't think I'm on RH nuts. You're just being disingenuous with your statement imo.Fascinating. Thank you.While this is true Robinhood was still the first and all the others followed. You might think that free trades were inevitable but it didn't seem like it when I was paying $5/trade at ScottTrade. Those companies held out as long as they could charging outrageous fees. They only stopped because RH came along.No, but Americans will have access to ADRs (American Depository Receipts) for some foreign companies.  ADRs are traded just like regular stocks and represent shares in foreign companies.FreeTrade launched after RH and is basically a UK knockoff of RHThe cheapest is $10 in Australia, flat fee. This ‘disrupter’ changed the game, before that it was even more and brokerage scaled higher by order size. We could do with robinhood.No, but they offer CFDs which are interesting as wellNo, it's not. Each country has their own financial regulatory authority. You wanna operate as a broker in a country, you gotta do what they say. For example, Degiro can't even keep clients' money in MMF denominated in PLN anymore, so every deposit is converted to EUR right away. If they say, you have to provide tax information in their language, you have to do it. See how that would cost money?No, they actually sell their order flow to market makers and the makers give the broker some fee that's taken from the bid ask spread.European here, was indeed sad to see that I could not invest in VOO haha. I know MiFiD is like 1000+ pages, but why can't Europeans buy these ETF's? From what I heard it was because emittants like Vanguard had to supply certain documents ('essential investor information') before they could be traded and they simply refuse to do so for some reason I do not know

Edit: a brain fartI also use degiro and tbh there's not anything beyond the questionnaire. Even then, it seems very much a case of "well we gave him the questionnaire so he must be conscious of the risks" type of thing.

That said, I'm not sure how much more restriction they could be reasonably expected to put in my way. If I'm determined to lose my money, I'll find a way.I'm from the UK so I can only really compare to the brokers I've used here.

The two platforms I've used here which allow options trading are Degiro and IB, both require you complete a questionnaire to assess appropriateness. As far as I'm aware RH doesn't do that? 

Most other brokers you can trade options on aren't really comparable to RH though. Other brokers with these products tend to be geared more to experienced investors and not to young retail investors who have never made an investment before. They also don't gamify their platforms and congratulate users for having options enabled on their account which RH does.

I think RH should probably do what a lot of brokers do have a basic version and a pro version. Pros are fine paying a little commission in exchange for a better service and more product options. On the other hand, retail investors don't need margin trading and options. They just need a simple commission free platform to make long-term investments. Where RH goes wrong is that they mix a retail investment platform with professional grade offerings such as margin and options, and push their users towards these with gamification.I am using interactive brokers, but it is expensive unless you have 100k+ in assets. They charge a monthly fee for the sub 100k crowd.

For someone who doesn't have that much, I would recommend using Fidelity.Its a battle between Fidelity and Charles Schwab at this point.  

Fidelity owns their market makers, so you don't have to worry about order flow manipulation.

Charles schwab keeps their market makers in check not to abuse clients...too much.The big guys and high frequency traders can screw up your short-term trades but they really don't have much of an impact on the long-term value of the stock market. Buy-and-hold is still a great strategy.If you're in the US, Schwab, Fidelity, and TD Ameritrade are all great, and you can't go wrong with any of them. (Note that Schwab has acquired TD Ameritrade, though they haven't started merging the customer base yet.)

I think they're about equivalent when it comes to functionality, mobile apps, commissions, and so on. Schwab comes with a checking account (with debit card) that reimburses all ATM fees, even international. Fidelity also reimburses ATM fees, but only up to a limited amount, and not internationally. They all provide IRAs, 529s, CDs, futures trading, options, etc.

They all have trading desktop apps. Schwab has StreetSmart, Fidelity has Active Trader Pro, and TDA has Thinkorswim. Everyone raves about Thinkofswim, not so much the others. These apps are mostly applicable to day trading (requires a $25k equity balance due to SEC regulations).Depends on the brokerage. The "free" platforms can sell that information.

https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/how-robinhood-makes-90-million-order-flowIt would be like you went to a car dealership, said you wanted to buy a car, but then a third party came in and bought the car, and now they're willing to sell the car to you for $1,000 more than the dealer price.

It is legitimate buying and selling but the person buying the car has no intention of actually owning the underlying asset and it just looking to make money off you.SEC is currently suspended from enforcing anything due to open-season for financial fraud from current federal leadership. Maybe if we get Warren in charge they would care about stopping wall street tax dodgers from robbing you blind.>Oh my god is that what's happened to me a few times.



Robinhood makes money by selling its data to other brokers. As they say, when someone gives you a "free" product, YOU are the product.can you guys not trade options with your platforms?

How is is that Australia offers more advanced features (for free) than countries like the UK and Canada?I'm a bit curious where they go from here.

They derive a significantly higher amount of revenue from order flow than one would think, which basically says market makers believe RH order flow is more valuable to them.  I can't imagine that's a condition that exists indefinitely and order flow alone cannot support a brokerage - especially given the gigantic disconnect in customer experience between RH and like Schwab or Fidelity. 

A managed product makes sense but again where do you go?  Realistically speaking all managed products at this level are the same.  Some mix of index products with rebalancing and tax harvesting only differentiated by marketing.  For better or worse most people interested in a managed platform have already gone to like betterment or whomever else.  I'm guessing but I don't think your average RH client is looking for a long term managed product.  

My best guess is you'll see an acquisition at some point but I can't see Fidelity or Schwab being interested, Vanguard really doesn't touch acquisitions.  Morgan Stanley just gobbled up E*trade so maybe they're looking to move more in to the active trader space but who knows.If they are profitable and CAC is their only issue then backing out of the UK where they already had a waiting list of free CAC users lined up makes zero sense.This ignores the fact that Robinhood has been around since 2013 and no major brokerage made a move to cut commissions to 0 until 2019. None. Last year, Schwab cut commissions to 0 and every other broker followed suit almost immediately (technically, IBKR actually offered a free tier a few weeks before Schwab did, but Schwab did it for all their customers first). 

Robinhood really had no effect on the other brokerages.Uhhh they had though.  The entire point is lots of commission free brokers have popped up at various points in history.  Schwab and Fidelity are the first ones to change their model to profitably do that.  

Don't misinterpret coincidence for influence.  And let's not pretend like Robinhood has broad influence outside of basically people who aren't profitable as customers.  Like I said in the first post, a lot of this attitude that I see regarding RH as some industry force comes from the perspective of very young and very new investors.  Most everyone I talk to outside of Reddit either hasn't heard of Robinhood or knows it's the app college kids use.  That's not a slight or anything, I think it's important that people actually try and learn about the rest of the brokerage industry because it's clear there's a lot of very deep misconception driven by their limited purview.Ok, but then it's a uncanny coincidence that while the brokers were def going lower, it wasn't until just very recently that they went to zero.

I've been trading since the late 80s and going to zero fees was a long time coming and changes how I think about trading to some extent.

I find it a significant difference to go to zero and is times with Robinhood (and other forces, to be sure) but I think when they see the future of investing in how young people are doing it --well that makes for some wake up calls.

I personally think they should go back to low fee -- but it's hard to walk something like that back.I really don't.  It's hard to determine exactly what motivates execs behind closed doors but imo the best case scenario for RH's influence is moving the timeline up 12-24 months.  Everyone went to $4ish a trade well before anyone gave a shit who RH was. 

That isn't a slight on RH, at the very least they've generated a lot of interest( for better or worse) in trading.  But it's so interesting to me that Reddit seems to think RH is some noteworthy industry influence and when I'm at like Schwab impact or whatever they're barely acknowledged outside of punchlines or people referencing their kids.  

IMO Schwab's push to neuter TD was a much larger driver than any other factor by a long shot.  Within the last few years it had become apparent that TD had not restructured their business to reflect industry trends and Schwab saw an opportunity then went for the jugular.  There's rumors that there was a rejected buyout offer prior to the commission drop and that Schwab accelerated their plans to drop in order to push TD in to the deal.  

But rumors are just rumors.Levine's column the day after the announcement was particularly hilarious: 

>We talked about this decision the next day, and I pointed out that this was not a particularly big loss for Schwab. Last year commissions represented less than 7% of Schwab’s net revenue. Most of Schwab’s money comes from net interest revenue—paying brokerage customers lower rates on their idle cash than it gets by investing that cash—with asset management fees also a big contributor. If you cut commissions to zero, you can (try to) attract more client assets, which means more net interest revenue and more opportunities to sell asset management. It could be a good business decision. On the other hand losing 7% of your revenue is losing 7% of your revenue. All else equal, you’d rather have the extra revenue. And Schwab had to know—everyone knew—that its competitors would cut their commissions to zero to try to keep market share; this is an intensely competitive business, and the main thing that discount brokerages compete on is commissions. Schwab’s stock closed down almost 10% that day, suggesting that loss of commission revenue might outweigh the market-share gains.


>But 10% is less than 25%. Schwab’s decision was way more painful for Ameritrade than it was for Schwab itself, and again the reason is pretty clear. Ameritrade makes more of its living from commissions— 36% of net revenue in 2018, versus 7% for Schwab—and, since Schwab’s move basically forced it to end commissions too, it was losing a lot more money. And while Schwab’s stock recovered—it was up 7% between Sept. 30 and yesterday—Ameritrade’s hasn’t really; it closed yesterday at $41.38, for a market capitalization of about $22.4 billion.


>Fox Business, which first reported the deal, reports that “Charles Schwab is buying Ameritrade for $26 billion,” which is pretty much what Ameritrade was worth the day before Schwab’s move. **Presumably if they’d done a deal on Sept. 30, Schwab would have paid a premium over that price. Instead Schwab tanked Ameritrade’s stock price and then got to buy it for cheap.** (Also, loosely speaking, if you are a discount brokerage who has figured out how to make money from customers without charging them commissions, and you buy a discount brokerage who hasn’t mastered that, there are opportunities for synergies.) It has a certain flair. “Schwab Seizes on Industry Turmoil With Plan to Buy TD Ameritrade,” is the Bloomberg headline, but of course Schwab created that turmoil, then seized on it.


>If I were on Ameritrade’s board of directors I would, of course, fulfill my fiduciary duties to shareholders by carefully evaluating the financial and other merits of any merger proposal, but I’d also be kind of annoyed to get one from Schwab. You guys put us in this situation; now you want to take advantage of it? I look forward to reading the “Background of the Merger” section of the Schwab/Ameritrade proxy statement to see how this unfolded. Were Schwab and Ameritrade in discussions before Schwab’s price cut? Did Schwab cut its commissions without warning Ameritrade, and then show up at that day’s merger negotiations with a sly grin? Or—as I suspect is true—did the discussions only really start after the price cut? **Did Schwab call up Ameritrade the day after cutting commissions and say, with total mock-innocence, “hey, I see you guys are having a rough day, can we help?”** 

That's my best interpretation.  Schwab knew it was going to cut to zero sooner or later and decided doing so then meant they could pull off an acquisition they wanted to make in the first place at a steep discount.  All of the facts seem to support the idea and a few people I've spoken with since have expressed that Schwab had been eyeing them for some time.  They certainly didn't manage to construct a full aquisition proposal within such a short timeframe so they had to have been working on it prior to pulling the trigger on the commission cut.Like I said, you'd need to just ignore everything that happened in the industry for the last 30 years to think that.  IDK why people feel the need to argue over this sort of thing, it's a matter of fact that the trend in commission had been down for 45 years and if anything decelerated a bit in the last decade.  So comparing that to fossil fuel makes absolutely no sense.  It's like people treat me explaining that their view of the brokerage industry is super limited as some sort of attack.  The fact is if there's a multi decade trend line it's really silly to attribute the end of that trend to something that didn't alter it's course one bit.

The point here isn't that RH is good or bad, it's that if you think they had noteworthy influence over the entire brokerage industry then you likely have quite a bit to learn about the brokerage industry.  And this can either be an opportunity to learn about the history of regulation and industry trends or not.  One of the reasons I really hesitate to even post anymore is that within the last few years Reddit has changed from a discussion forum to an arguing forum.  

You freely admit you're about to switch away from RH so one can readily assume you're relatively new to investing - yet the first thing that happens is you start arguing with me about the brokerage industry.  Like come on, when I started buying stocks comissions were $18 or maybe $12 if you went to e*trade.  They fell across the board within the last decade to $4 well before RH was something anyone cared about.  Like feel free to hold whatever beliefs you'd like to but there's no cause to dismiss actual information about how the rest of the industry has been working for decades because you didn't like it.Yeah I mean this is exactly what I'm talking about. Robinhood definitely isn't the first person to offer free trades.  There's been probably half a dozen notable brokers since the 90s. 

And if you think $5 was a ridiculous fee then there's no way you have been investing for more than 5  years because that's literally a third of average commissions just a decade ago.  

Like I said above, lots of this attitude is just driven by people who haven't paid attention to anything happening in the industry over time.ADRs are usually only available for a fraction of the companies available out there. I know Swedish Ericsson’s ADRs are available in the US. And I know Japanese Nissan is. But it seems hard to diversify your stock portfolio with none American stocks using RH. I live in Sweden, and my online broker offers online real-time trading in all European exchanges, the US and Canada. And for virtually all exchanges in the world but only on the phone. So I guess to have that you’d have to use one of the other large trading platforms in the US, like Scwab?Pretty muchIt works pretty okay thoughtbf, that's where most US brokerages until relatively recently ($6ish, so about 9-10 AUD)they still have the duty of best execution, and the order flow payments are not directly related to the bid ask spread your order fills at -- your broker does not benefit from a larger bid ask spread, although a market maker might.That's basically it. There is a schedule of information which needs to be compiled in a specific format and updated within specific timelines and provided to the right compliance agencies. It also imbues some level of liability on the person providing the information, which is very much antithetical to the purpose and existence of passive ETFs. A compliance officer from Interactive Brokers told me the larger US ETF providers only provide information based on *their* compliance standards, developed in the US for the US market. Deviating from that opens them up to all kinds of new legal risks and exposes them to issues like inconsistent reporting, differential marketing, and arbitrage issues across the buy and sell side, among so many others.

I get it. These requirements are stupid. Just let me invest in whatever I want. *I'm* assuming the risk here. Stop protecting me from myself. These are advanced financial instruments. We don't need training wheels.RH does actually do that.

What RH doesn't do though is proper risk management, closing insane positions, not letting tiny accounts take on unlimited risk, etc.+1 to Fidelity, they are pretty great in most places.Thanks.

I thought it was big on CFDs like UK. Here you can buy sell CFDs on options but it's only limited to certain indices.You make great points.  I was absolutely convinced Robinhood would be acquired at the same time as TD and E*Trade.  My money was on Goldman to expand their Marcus business;  hasnt happened yet, but Goldman just bought Folio and United Capital and has stated a strategic vision into Invest.

This is just spitballing, but what if Robinhood launched a super risky, high reward managed product that involved option plays which would cater to their customer type?> They derive a significantly higher amount of revenue from order flow than one would think, which basically says market makers believe RH order flow is more valuable to them.

How is RH able to get away with selling order flows? Don't regulators require "best execution"?

If RH is selling order flows to the highest bidder, it is unlikely that those orders are getting "best execution". This is likely not something that the investors who finally have access to free trading care too much about, but I'm sure the SEC does. 

How does RH get away with this?Agreed, except UK has regulations addressing PFOF, which is Robinhood’s main revenue stream.  I’d bet reality set in that its a poor strategic move.Unless they all did it at once, they'd see their userbase flock to whoever didn't raise their commissions/trading fees. I know I paid $4.95/trade at Schwab before they brought it down to $0, and would hate to go back to that.I agree it would have happened eventually! And there were a lot of factors. I think that you're right that some saw an opportunity to hurt the competition, but I also think that many saw a new generation of investors entering the marketplace and every day missing out on bringing them into their platform. We'll never know for sure how it all went down, but once one went down they all did.[deleted]So it seems like consensus is schwab new exactly what it was doing and the commission cut and quick pick up of TDA was part of the same plan.

I guess I still wonder did TDA know or expect this? Where they like "Yea we knew this was coming" or did one day schwab just take them out at the knee cap...then later show up offering a ride to the hospital?Thanks for posting, that was a fun read.I've been investing for 30+ years. RH is the best thing to come along in that entire time. 

The comments in here are hilarious to me. If people don't like their product don't use it. The ways people find to complain about a product they don't use and don't claim to even like is absurd.ETFs are advanced financial instruments?How does Fidelity compare to Robinhood?It's the exact opposite.  They'll see a large number of stop loss orders set up for a certain price, and sell until they've pushed the price below the point the stop loss is at. 

Then, when the price has been depressed by all the stop loss orders selling, they'll re-buy at the lower cost.

So they profit off the initial sale at the higher price, and repurchase the same assets at lower prices.>Robinhood would be acquired at the same time as TD and E\*Trade

I am not sure any of the brokerages want the RH users, small time users that will flood service desk with tons of calls .

Lots of brokerages prided themselfs for great customer service , having 10 million new RH users trying to explain settlement times , PDT rules, ect....would be a nightmare

RH gets away with it because they offer zero customer service ;Managed products make RH the fiduciary and not just the broker which involves a significant amount of liability, especially given their customer base.  They'd be absolutely insane to take on that sort of risk. 

Not saying that 100% means they won't.  Historically RH hasn't had the best track record of considering regulatory risk when doing something.  The comical attempt at rolling out cash management comes to mind.it's weird how just $5 makes you reconsider making tradesIt's so fascinating that people decide explaining the last few decades of trend in brokerage service model is somehow looking down upon something.I'm not sure what you think I'm complaining about?  But if you've actually been investing for that long then you really need to pay more attention because you made at least two materially incorrect statements above.For starters you can speak to a human within a few minutes by placing a phone call. Robinhood make get back to you in 2-5 business days via email. 

Secondly, their active trader pro is far better than anything Robinhood provides. 

Lastly, they also have my retirement accounts so for me its great because I have everything in one place.You didn't tell the best part; they used your own stock to do this.[removed]Those are great points.  While I think Robinhood traders didnt have quite the reputation of being unsophisticated last fall as they do today (Hertz), the Opex is absolutely lower due to their shitty customer service, and wouldnt be sustainable on another platform.  Thats why I thought someone trying to break into brokerage could be a viable buyer.  Brokerage is a super low margin business and requires scale.I agree in theory, but the trades I was making - that $5 was a lot. I'm depositing $300-500 in my account every paycheck and then generally buying stock based on that, so Schwab was charging me somewhere between 1-2% as a flat fee for trades I was making. It led to me holding up multiple paychecks-worth of DCA's to do all at once because I'd rather pay a $5 fee for investing ~$3k than $500.It shouldn't. If $5 makes your trade bad, then it was bad to begin with.lolYour submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*See I suspect schwab and fidelity actually love RH but would never want to buy them.

Here is what seems to be happening , RH is marketing stock trading and investing pulling in millions of new users, most of these new users are would be unprofitable users to schwab; they  really wouldn't want them customers. Customers with $500 accounts that violate PDT rules then flood the help desk with questions , low cash balances low net worths.

However it seems like a lot of users start with ronbinhood then grow out of it and move to schwab/fidelity , and they are able to siphon of the 5% of RH customers that would be profitable .

I think they are happy letting RH suck in the millions of new users, they know the serous ones will transfer out of RH to them and RH will deal with the small users you don't want.I agree.  That being said, Schwab is on track to spend $270 Million in marketing this year, just below what they spent in 2019.  Robinhood’s main value is their 13 million customers, which I believe makes them more desirable for a bank player to absorb them and cross-sell other products.  I bet Robinhood’s customer base is pretty ideal for unsecured personal loans, which is a high margin product.  

That was my thinking last fall.  Considering they are still growing at a 30%+ annual rate in customers, they’ll most likely go public eventually.  But what are they planning with the $600 Million they just raised?  Given how they shoot from the hip, it could be anything!**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

TIPS aren't a panacea. Long term, yes, they'll protect purchasing power. Short term, they provide an even lower return than ordinary treasuries. People buying them now are buying in anticipation of inflation down the road. Disclosure: I have some myself.

Real estate has its own risks. For instance, people are losing jobs left and right. People that aren't sure about their employment security right now would probably do well to steer away from something that's going to require a 10-20% downpayment coming out of their current savings.

I've been doing a few things. For one, I've been stepping down my credit quality, shifting slowly from Treasuries to Corporates. At least there is some reward there. They don't have the inverse correlation that Treasuries do, but so long as the Fed remains a backstop, they'll have more value during a future market dislocation, which can be used to rebalance and buy cheaper equities, should that event occur.

I've also been stepping into the closed end space. My TIPS bucket now also contains WIW, which is essentially a leveraged TIPS portfolio, where the borrowings are used to buy more speculative bonds. I've also made a minute investment in a Double Line fund. Again, this doesn't provide the inverse correlation to the market. I've been enjoying the opportunity to buy closed end funds at discounts to their NAV (in the case of WIW), or at NAV when they typically trade at a premium.

I have been contemplating buying FXE (an ETF that  holds Euros).

But ultimately, I think we just need to accept that there isn't a place to hide anymore. You've got cash - guaranteed loser to inflation. You've got fixed income - loser to inflation AND yields on quality are so low now that there is tremendous interest rate risk. You've got REITS - quite beaten up and entirely dependent on the rest of the economy opening  so people can pay rents again. 

There is gold still. There are commodities and commodity producers. But looking at the landscape, all i see is uncertainty.If you don't mind tying up the money for 5 years I would go with I-Series bonds vs tips, you can only buy 10k per year (per person )

They pay a low interest rate but like tips are also adjusted quarterly for inflation

Edit Adjusted every 6 months for inflation not quarterlyYou've stumbled onto one of the main reasons the stock market is so high now in spite of declining fundamentals. People are scared of a crash, but they don't have a better place to park money so it's waiting in equities.

A real crash would take out many corporate bonds through bankruptcies, take out gold when countries liquidate to raise recovery cash, and take out gov Treasury bonds as the FED tries to print it's way out of the problem. In my opinion TIPS are one of the least-bad choices.You know that Treasury bonds have different yields based on duration? The whole curve isn't 0%. If you want more yield but you don't want more credit risk, then you must take on more duration risk. It's impossible to get extra yield without taking on extra risk so you have to pick your poison.TIPs ultimately behave like nominal government bonds, because of the fact that they are essentially government bonds. If inflation actually goes up to become a problem, the Fed will raise interest rates to fight it and your TIPs will lose value just like normal bonds.

Maybe gold would be a better hedge against inflation and interest rate.In this climate, the only two things are certain:

HYSA or money in TIPS.  

The main question is what are your concerns around liquidity?>Get a mortgage and buy a house

I keep seeing that this is a great time to buy but I don't really understand why. Home prices and interest rates have an inverse relationship. Buyers and banks look at what the buyer can afford as a monthly payment to determine what price they can afford. What you are saving on interest, you are paying as extra principal. The people that really win in a low interest rate environment are the ones that bought at a lower price when rates were higher and refinanced to these low rates.High yield savings accounts. Mine still gives me 1% and is FDIC protected.Selling out of the money options on low beta stocks. This isn't what people would commonly consider a low risk strategy, due to the fact that options are seen as high risk products, but, managed correctly, this can give you a yield bigger than inflation, without taking on much risk. Also, people already proposed all the other safe and boring investments (TIPs, utilities, gold etc.)

WARNING: This strategy requires a little work, like 1 hour monthly. In total.

Let's say I want a 5% yearly return on a 10k investment. So I aim for a 500$ yearly return, or 42$ a month. I choose a stock with low beta (AT&T has a beta of 0.68, that's very low) and I sell some put contracts. I can sell 4 puts at the 25$ strike price, which is 95% out of the money, for 12$ each, for the 21 Aug expiration date (we're doing monthlies for simplicity). That's a 48$ profit with very low risk.
If I want a higher yield, I can go for 27$ strike price (which is still beyond SD1 and 84% out of the money), selling 3 puts for 26$ each, making 78$ a month, or about 9% anually.
AT&T did not drop below 27$ even in feb/march when the market was bottoming, so I would say we are pretty safe with either of the options.

Is this as safe and simple as bonds? Not really. The advantage is that you choose how much risk you are willing to take, how much profit you want and how you manage your risk. Also, this method is very liquid.

In case of assignment you just do the wheel strategy.TIPS is a good solution housing on the other hand. I personally think housing is rather difficult unless you know what you gotta look for. Location, price paid can be difficult for those who aren’t inept at spotting these. Also wear and tear over time potentially causing depreciation in value.

Let me know if you have any questions.corp bondsIF you don't mind a bit more risk I like PFF.  It invests in preferred stock (somewhat weighted towards financials).  It also yields 5.7% and pays dividends monthly.  If you look at the 5 year chart you'll see it doesn't move around very much.  Although there is some considerable risk if banks start failing.Extremely high-quality corporate bonds could be helpful.

Take, for example, bonds of AAPL, MSFT and similarly high quality, less indebted company that could potentially serve your need for the next few years.

After that time period, you may switch to whatever company's corporate bonds that would be attractive at that time.

Also, you could look into foreign governments with comparatively OK credit ratings and their bonds. Especially considering that USD would probably underperform for the upcoming few years with regards to other currencies, it could be a smart move, even with comparatively low interest rates.

Other exotic markets like private equity(you would be surprised if you see the fortress balance sheets of some japanese firms) could also work for others, but it wouldn't work for you, I guess.Dividend aristocrats.i would say assess what the real risk is.

For instance,

SPY, id say the likely maxed unrealized loss is 50-60% before a major rebound.

Knowing this, you can do all sorts of things to adjust for this.

For example, DCA will cut this loss by half. Factor in dividends and covered calls at 1-2% per month, this can further reduce it by another 10%, bring your actual loss to around 10-15%.

Assuming a major hit like this takes its course over 2-3 years,  this means for this time your max expected loss is around 10-15%. Then once the recovery starts to happen, you can expect an average of at least 6% in growth + options premium + dividends. So by the 4-5th year, youve likely recouped your loss and have another 2-3 years of expected bull market.utilitiesVolatility has permeated the whole market, friend.

Paper Gold is worth diversifying into now in my opinion but it is very volatile.Corporate bonds of businesses with strong balance sheets that can weather a storm, and high-yield savings accounts come to mind.This is the reason why the stock market has been flying.

Great comment.

My 401k is mostly REITs, so I'm not looking for more exposure to them, especially not in taxable accounts as they are tax inefficient. Either way I wouldn't consider them an alternative to something like $BND, with equivalent risk and volatility characteristics: the recent COVID crisis showed how volatile they can be.

Personally, I'm leaning more and more towards just holding $120k or so in TIPS. Essentially, I need a highly-liquid, low-volatility, low-risk cash-alternative, so I can fund my living expenses in case the market tanks again and I lose my job. TIPS seem to fit the bill, with the added benefit of protecting against the likely incoming surge in inflation.> You've got REITS - quite beaten up and entirely dependent on the rest of the economy opening so people can pay rents again.

Incidentally, why do you consider I-Series bonds to be better than TIPS?You can sell Series I savings bonds after 1 year (actually as short as 11 months and a day depending on the day of the month you got the bond).

It's impossible to get extra yield without taking on extra risk so you have to pick your poison.

Yup, though I wouldn't be so eager to buy long-duration bonds unless I were holding them the entire duration and willing to forego higher interim yields.  We're much more likely to be in a rising-rate environment now, which makes long-term bonds unattractive.>the Fed will raise interest rates to fight it

Eh, I'm not so sure they will. One of the potential "solutions" to the enormous debt the U.S. has taken on recently is to inflate away a big chunk of it by running a hot (higher than 2%) economy for a few years. 4-5 years of 4% inflation would sure make our debt a lot "smaller" in real terms in a short amount of time. 

And I know maintaining steady 2% inflation is in the Fed's mandate but we've seen the Fed chicken out of stuff they signaled they would do in the past because of markets. My memory is a bit fuzzy but I vaguely recall the fed indicating they would start easing (or even stopping/pausing?) QE in 2014 and equities fell as a result -- the fed quickly reversed course.

I might be remembering the last bit wrong but the point is the Fed has gone against their aims in the past to appease political and market interests and I can see them doing so again.> If inflation actually goes up to become a problem, the Fed will raise interest rates to fight it and your TIPs will lose value just like normal bonds.

Very interesting point, but aren't TIPS more of a guarantee to retain value in face of high inflation?

For example, if inflation rises, but the Fed fails to raise interest rates for any reason (political, whatever), then TIPS should protect you against that, while other government bonds will do nothing for you?No, if inflation becomes a thing, then the principal value of TIPS is adjusted upward as a result. Essentially, you WANT inflation while owning TIPS, that's their entire point. In a low inflation environment, and with a lower coupon, your'e better off owning straight Treasuries than TIPS.> The main question is what are your concerns around liquidity?

I'm considering this for my emergency fund, so I require high liquidity. TIPS are highly liquid, right? At least if you buy them as a mutual fund like VAIPX?Or some utilities too. Stable like bonds + decent dividendGood point.Exactly. (After a dozen or so homes, I can confirm each of your points).I considered it. Two issues:

1. HYSA rates keep changing a lot. Online banks bait new customers with a high rate for a while, then once these customers are locked in, they drop the rate. You are now stuck with a low rate or the high cost of switching banks for a few more basis points.
2. 1% won't beat inflation even on a good year. If inflation goes up a lot (a reasonable concern in this environment) your funds' real value will take a big hit.OP is after low risk and a black swan event in an individual stock would destroy them.

You could then sell covered calls on the stock as it moves sideways, adding another 5-7%. It’s already dropped a lot, so it should hold steady, but you could also buy some OTM protective puts if you’re worries about that.

This article from this past week explains the strategy with AT&T, and estimates 14%. Not bad, I’m probably going to buy 100 shares this week and start experimenting with the strategy.

How would you protect yourself?Wouldn’t it be hard to find a buyer for these thoughYour better option is buying a non volatile stock and buying enough put contracts months out to create a covered call if you see a dip in the market coming.

Edit: since people seem to disagree, I took the liberty of charting [US stocks vs. utilities vs. long bonds](http://quotes.morningstar.com/chart/etf/chart.action?t=VTI&region=usa&culture=en_US&dataParams=%7B%22zoomKey%22%3A6%2C%22version%22%3A%22US%22%2C%22showNav%22%3Afalse%2C%22mainSettingId%22%3A%22main%22%2C%22navSettingId%22%3A%22nav%22%2C%22benchmarkSettingId%22%3A%22benchmark%22%2C%22sliderBgSettingId%22%3A%22sliderBg%22%2C%22volumeSettingId%22%3A%22volume%22%2C%22id%22%3A%22FEUSA0002P%7CFEUSA04ACG%7CFOUSA06KY3%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22FE%7CFE%7CFE%22%2C%22region%22%3A%22USA%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22ARCX%3AVTI%7CARCX%3AVPU%7CARCX%3AEDV%22%2C%22qsType%22%3A%22USA%3AVTI%7CFEUSA04ACG%7CFOUSA06KY3%22%2C%22baseCurrency%22%3A%22USD%22%2C%22defaultBenchmarks%22%3A%5B%22%24FOCA%24LB%24%24%7CLarge%20Blend%7CCA%5DFE%22%2C%22XIUSA04G92%7CS%26P%20500%20TR%20USD%7CXI%22%5D%2C%22startDay%22%3A%2207%2F18%2F2019%22%2C%22endDay%22%3A%2207%2F17%2F2020%22%2C%22chartWidth%22%3A955%2C%22hideDividendMenu%22%3Afalse%7D).

In fact, utilities not only crashed with stocks more broadly, they've been slower to recover this year. Not bond-like at all.>My 401k is mostly REITs

hooo boy!If this is living expense money, you might choose CD ladders instead. In the event of no inflation, you’ll make more from their interest than you will in TIPs or treasuries. And they’re FDIC insured.Something like 30% of people are missing their rent and mortgage payments to these last few months, even with government assistance. 

The thing is, people complain that the low wage earners are taking home more than they made before right now, the medium and high wage earners are still bringing home less even with the extra government help. So, residential reits get hurt 
 
Office space is empty everywhere and so are malls. Not good for commercial reits. 

So for some people, they’ve temporarily made more and been able to keep the roofs over their heads.  That support is going to disappear soon. For many others, even the extra help hasn’t been enough to cover their overheads, and that’s going away soon. As for commercial - there’s loans available, but why borrow to pay a lease on a property you can’t use because everything is locked down?

I don’t think the sector is a safe place to hide. That said I have exposure to them and thing there will be decent returns in the future, but whether that’s a year, two years or longer I don’t know. Nor do i know if they’ll go down further first.Currently? No. It’s great that companies can borrow so cheaply. I hope some of them using their borrowings to call in their older, higher yielding debt. But with the rates that are getting locked in, the corporate debt bubble is the last of our worries today. Maybe 10 years out, when these bonds start coming due, but that’s so far down the road, I don’t think there’s much reason to fret today or next month.The interest payments accrue so you do not have a tax liability until you redeem them, vs quarterly payments with tips , Ibonds principal will never go down even if there is deflation

With TIPS it can go down though it will never go under the principal amount.

Meaning lets say you have $1000 , and after a few years its adjusted to $1080 due to inflation adjustments

TIPS could potentially fall down to $1000 again if there is deflation , ibonds would never get adjusted down for deflation

So not a huge differenceYour principal can never decrease with I-bonds whereas they can with TIPs during deflationary periods.  The downside is that inflation adjustments are made much more frequently to the TIPs yield compared with I bonds, so when there is unexpected inflation it won't be reflected in the bond's interest rate until May or November of that year.  On the flip side this makes them advantageous to buy during periods of low inflation or deflation.  You could get I-bonds with a fixed (permanent) rate of .2% until May 1 of this year which is much higher than what TIPs of any duration have been yielding.> but I'm single and looking to park about $120k, so the $10k per year is a deal-breaker

I see this opinion over and over again and it makes no sense to me. Put your $10k in I-bonds this year. You can put another $10k in EE bonds. Then January 1st you can put in more. These investments are superior to other government bonds in every respect except they are not traded on an open market. The fact they are limited means you should max them out, not that you should avoid them. If these bonds weren't such a great deal the government wouldn't limit your ability to purchase them.It it looks like it suits your needs, then $10k shouldn't be a deal breaker. It just means $10k now, $10k on Jan 1, and then just needing to find someplace else to park $100k.> Thanks, but I'm single and looking to park about $120k,

Just put it in PIMCO Enhanced Short Maturity Active Exchange-Traded Fund (MINT).  Monthly dividends, principal won't decrease.Why would that be a deal breaker.... just use 10k and find something else for the other 110If I were looking for good bond options and had $120K, I'd do the following: (1) buy 10K each of Series I and EE Bonds right now, (2) buy another 10K each of both on January first. That right there takes care of 1/3 of the funds you're talking about. (3) The rest you could put in cash, CDs or other bonds and slowly buy up I and EE bonds for a few more years. These two types of government-issued bonds are basically the free lunches of bond investing right now and have been for some time. I Bonds return more than TIPS, their closest open-market equivalents, while EE bonds (with their special provision that they double in value no matter the stated interest rate after 20 years) return much more than 20-year Treasuries, their closest open-market equivalents (3.5% versus 1.1%). Both are tax-deferred and with I Bonds in particular your holding period is yours to decide - anywhere from 1 to 30 years.Put 120k into SDOW should make a fortune\^\^This guys I-bonds.

I use the "secret" 11-month strategy as well.Yes but if you sell them before 5 years you lose 3 months worth of interestTreasury directI mean to be clear these are very safe low returns investments.

I am not sure if you can buy them in a IRA you probably can. So what I have been doing is buying the 10k per year now I have some excess cash, this will be my little buffer and hopefully I can build up 200k or so over the next 20 years, I will then invest my retirement savings a bit more aggressively ; because if there is a down turn when I am looking to retire I will be able to draw on these very safe i bonds as income to wait out the market for 4-5 years for my retirement to recover . Note I will still probably have a 60/40 retirement portfolio as I close in on retirement so its not like I am forgoing all bonds because of theseYou can’t buy them in an IRA.Countries liquidate their gold position, which means they sell a lot of gold in a hurry, which would drive price downJust in case you're not aware, BND is an _aggregate_ fund, not a pure US bond fund — it has just around 43% US Treasury bonds.

BND is all (US) IG bonds of all durations.> We're much more likely to be in a rising-rate environment now

That's been the idea for 30 years straight. I don't expect it to happen without a radical shift away from neo-liberalism. Personally, I wish the Treasury would just go ahead and float 50 and/or 100 year bonds. If rates are low, then prices are high, which means it's a seller's market. Not to mention, how useful they would be for insurance companies and pension funds who can't really match the durations of their liabilities and assets without using perpetual instruments like equity and preferred stock.The Fed might let inflation run a little over 2%, but I can't see them letting inflation go much further than the 4% you mentioned. I think they learned the lessons of the 1970's, and won't let inflation go anywhere near double digits.Interesting, not a bad idea and would be in favour of TIPs.Yes, but think about the Feds goals. One of them is to maintain inflation at 2% and the other is to maintain interest rates at 2-5%, current situation not withstanding.

If inflation starts ramping up to above 2%, its almost guaranteed the Fed will take action. It’s not a solid inflation hedge as it’s made out to be.You have principal risk. If interest rates go up, then the TIPS that you already own are worth less on the open market.Right but if interest rates increase above rate of the TIPS then you’ve lost out. If you sell your bond before maturity it will be subject to market and interest rate risk.

And if you buy through an etf you’re subject to those risks already.Even that fund took major hit during March crashTIPS (generally speaking) are like any stock or ETF of which take a settlement day of N+2 for you to trade out of and then transfer from your brokerage firm.  For example, if you sold of of your TIPS on a Friday (at Fidelity for example) you would have to wait until close of market Tuesday to then transfer them out Wednesday morning of which you're beholden to how long that ACH takes to hit your bank.

Something to think about.  Generally from everything I've read on the Bogelheads forums, if it is an emergency fund, HYSA is the best bet since you'll have greater access without needing to wait on market variables.TIPS are liquid but your principal isn't guaranteed. You can sell them for whatever they're worth on the bond market, which means that it's possible that you have to sell for a loss.>HYSA rates keep changing a lot. Online banks bait new customers with a high rate for a while, then once these customers are locked in, they drop the rate. You are now stuck with a low rate or the high cost of switching banks for a few more basis points.

It's a competitive market and in my experience it moves around with overall interest rates and not based on the length of your banking relationship i.e. they are not going to drop rates on you simply because you banked with them for six months. For one thing it would be illegal to drop rates for one customer but not another. I've banked with discover for two years and have been satisfied with their HYSA so far. 



>1% won't beat inflation even on a good year. If inflation goes up a lot (a reasonable concern in this environment) your funds' real value will take a big hit.

This is true, but we are in a low inflation environment so it's not as big of a problem as you think. If you want security, you have to settle for low returns (both absolute and inflation adjusted). If you're specifically worried about inflation, buy TIPS like somebody else suggested.High cost of switching banks?

Why don't you have your bank you use to interface with, like credit card payment or mortgage or payroll from companies, and then another bank for holding the majority of your cash?

I have one bank to handle payroll, credit card, and a few k to handle month to month costs. This is the bank I trust the most and has the best customer service. I have stayed with this bank for many years, and will continue to do so.

Then I have most of my cash sitting in another bank, like ally or popular direct. I don't care about customer service, branch presence, fancy debit cards, atm, etc. All I do with this bank is move the majority of my cash over from bank to bank to get the "deposit $k here for y months and get z bonus" routine. Once I get the bonus, I see what other offers there are in terms of bonus or interest, and then move that money again.

Creating a new bank account online is trivial, and moving money between banks, while slow, is also trivial. I don't see any cost of doing this, while instead giving me more money.> 1% won't beat inflation even on a good year.

There is no need for me to link you to easily googleable basics, but I would definitely recommend you to hear the story of Karen the Supertrader: https://youtu.be/cXy9HoWX0es
She basically got fed up with the returns of her mutual fund and started trading options. Now she has her own mutual fund selling options.

It is pretty popular, but I would say it is not for the average Joe because it requires some financial education, some understanding of markets, some research and a little bit of brains. As you can see it is not as simple as investing in VTI or a mutual fund.

There are risks like getting assigned, but owning a stock like AT&T at 27$ (as per my example) would honestly be a good deal and it would definitely go higher.

With my example, you also take on unsystematic risk (the CEO dies tomorrow, the company is found to be involved in fraud, Elon comes and fucks shit up in the industry etc.), but, as other people pointed out, this risk can be diversified out by selling options on ETFs instead of individual stocks.[This is generally what I do](https://i.imgur.com/1XDZA89.png) and [I'm not complaining](https://i.imgur.com/ILzZJh6.png)

It significantly neutralizes my account's SPY weighted beta too which is nice since I'm bear-curious about the future market prospects.It is up to each investor to decide what stock to use for options, I just proposed the method and provided an exampleAT&T is definitely a good investment and this strategy has it's benefits. There are a lot of ways to make a steady return with safe investments.

OP mentioned that he is looking for some safe and modest returns by investing in something liquid. He might need a stratedy to beat inflation and be able to get out of the investment anytime it is needed, without losing gains. Only downside of owning the stock and selling covered calls would be if you need cash fast and T trades below your base cost.

The same risk applies if you sell puts, get assigned and do the wheel, but it has a lower chance of happening.It is definitely doable, as 90% OTM VOO puts (260$ strike price) that expire on 21 Aug are sold for 130-150$ , but you would need more cash collateral than the 10K in my example.

It just comes down to each investor's capital and risk profile.If AT&T drops below 25 and you soldputs with the 25 strike price, you would have to buy AT&T shares at 25$ each. That is a fenomenal price for a strong and stable business like AT&T, so having to buy the stock at that price is more of a win rather than a lose. Unless something like fraud is discovered within the company, which is highly unlikely.

I mention that this strategy is liquid because let's say that when you sell the contracts AT&T trades at 30$ and then drops to 28$. If you have to get out ASAP because you need cash, you can buy back the contracts with a very small loss or potentially a small profit due to tetha decay and free up your capital. On the other hand, if you own the stock and sell covered calls you might have to sell the stock at a loss in this case.

This is a very specific example and anyone who invests should follow the principle to not invest money you think you will need in the near future or that you can't afford to lose, but you get the point.you can simply look at the bid/ask to see if people are buying.  In his example he's not moving a lot of options, so it shouldn't be too bad if you set your price to the ask.I meant that home will naturally depreciate overtime due to weather etc. Of course you just repair it but thats then taken from the profit of the house if sold years later.UJUN is what I think op is referring to.

I think property can be a good long term investment, but there are expenses that can add a lot of risk.Not selling covered calls higher than your entryYou can lose money on the downside if a stock drops.

If you think the extra hassle of opening a separate account just for $200 a year is worth it, you should just clear a bank bonus with your time. Lots out there with a 10K deposit.Not exactly. There is a 1 year lockout period on I-Bonds and a 3-month penalty until 5 years.Thats a pretty good plan. Thank you for sharing.Damn, thanks for the info.And then there’s opportunity to buy at a lower price as well as more supply available for the physical commodityWhy would they do that, though?Thanks. If you're knowledgeable about $BND, then what would you expect $BND profits to be going forward, given our current zero interest environment?

Should holders of $BND consider switching out?Thanks, looked at EDV, and while it has some interesting performance characteristics, it's not strictly speaking an alternative to $BND due to its higher volatility. It does yield better, though. So a higher-risk, higher-return security.Agree. Central Banks have cornered themselves. The record issuance over the last few months means rates cannot ever rise again without unleashing the mother of all deflationary busts. I think negative rates are more likely than increases at this point.> That's been the idea for 30 years straight. I don't expect it to happen without a radical shift away from neo-liberalism.

Well, I'm guessing it won't drop another 10% over the next 30 years.  Granted, things could remain steady but is hard to say.

I don't think they're going to go back up to where they were before though.  Low rates just reflect a fairly efficient market - where a 2010 dollar is worth about as much as a 2020 dollar.Yeah I don't think anyone could reasonably argue otherwise.As an added benefit, it's a hedge against holding cash. I'm deep in SPIP right now because I'm sitting on 35% cash and DCAing in slowly (I had a windfall in February) to equities.Your argument is that high inflation will never happen again. That doesn't make TIPS a bad inflation hedge.If rates jump to say 5%, in all likelihood inflation has jumped nearly that much as well. So your principal adjusts.  If you stick to the shorter durations you minimize this also. Just continuously roll 1-5 year TIPS. 

But if you think high inflation that leads to higher interest rates is the enemy of TIPS, I think you’re misunderstanding the entire benefit that TIPS can provide.> Even that fund took major hit during March crash

It dropped from a peak of 27.22 on March 6th to a bottom of 24.77 on March 18th (an 11% drop), then recovered almost completely (to $26.64) by March 27th, and in fact is now higher than pre-COVID peak at 27.74. That's virtually the same as $BND performance and good enough for me.Waiting a week to get liquidity is fine. This is not for immediate cash (I keep enough in my regular savings account for that purpose).

I would expect VAIPX to outperform HYSA with the current low interest rates, and of course if inflation goes up.> we are in a low inflation environment

For now. The US debt is huge and we just printed a ton of money. There are many plausible scenarios in which the US intentionally lets inflation surge to lower its debt (which would otherwise become unmanageable).

Overall I'd say more likely than not, inflation will rise in the near to medium term.Rephrase to "match" inflation then.It’s literally every post on r/thetagangYes, they have some great videos.

It has a fair number of aristocrats...I looked up the [$VPU info page](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/vpu) and the first thing I noticed is that it's classified at the top 5/5 risk level by Vanguard.

Yes, bond yields are lower now and quite likely to stay low. That doesn't mean utilities can be swapped in for bonds and serve a remotely similar function. Vanguard's Utilities ETF crashed both in the 08/09 crisis and again this year, just like other sectors.That's just the stock price . There's also a dividend.Did you even click the link and look at the chart? Also: I don't care what Ray Dalio thinks.The total return of REITs has historically been the highest of all diversified asset classes. Yes, even higher than stocks. Their key problem is tax inefficiency. So holding them in tax-advantaged accounts makes sense.

This was the advice given to me by a financial advisor several years ago. Yes, COVID demolished REITs, but the advisor couldn't predict COVID, an exceptional and highly destructive event for REIT value.

For what it's worth, despite the drops, my REIT holdings are still in the green because of fantastic growth right up to COVID. I still don't get why holding REITs in tax advantaged is such a mistake, since they're not more risky than stocks.Yikes, yeah a 401K of mostly REITS sounds like [poor] advice that someone would give in like, mid-2005.The reason the bottom fell out of CD rates is because the fed pushed down borrowing rates across the board. 

You realize that you’re going to make less from TIPS for the foreseeable future, right? If you think 1.7% is a joke, look what you’re getting from 5-year TIPS: 

https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/press/preanre/2020/R_20200618_3.pdf

Their return is only going to come from inflation, which we all expect. But if it takes a year or two for all this money sloshing in the system to do its thing, you need to understand that TIPS have their own risks too.Yea tips will pay quarterly interest and that interest will be taxable for Federal tax

Ibonds are a zero coupon meaning the interest and inflation adjustments are just added to the value of the bond.

I believe you can pay taxes on the accruals if you want or simply deffer them until you redeem them.

Even then you may get out of paying taxes on the gains if you meet certain criteria like having college expenses or and AGI under 90k or something ; you can look up the specificsThey're 1.06% right now.  You could just have a savings account and do almost as well, and you'd have liquidity.

https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds.htm[deleted]I bonds are as liquid as a savings account. You can redeem them at any time after a year (there is an interest penalty of a few months if you redeem before 5 years).

TIPS cratered in March because liquidity dried up for them. It's usually not a problem, but like any marketable asset save for nominal Treasuries, it happens during times of crisis.I buy and sell through treasury direct. It's not difficult but the login process and username/password recovery requires a little more effort than your traditional banking website so it's a little less user friendly. I-bonds aren't available for redemption until after one year and if you sell before a certain maturity you lose 3 months of interest. I'd recommend them for a long term emergency fund or savings.I bonds are for accumulating, not trading.  

Yes, for purchasing, I-bonds are less liquid because you are limited in how much you can purchase a year.

No, for selling, I-bonds are as liquid as cash because Treasury buys the I-bonds from you any time after 1 year.  TIPS's liquidity depends on the market for them -- someone has to buy it off you, and someone has to pay a premium for the interest spread.  Treasury doesn't redeem TIPS before maturity.Look at TIPS yields right now:
https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=realyield

Notice that all TIPS yields are negative right now. This means you will earn between 0.28% and 1.06% *less* than inflation every year. Since I-bonds currently have a fixed rate of zero, you will at least match inflation.

But there are other reasons: if inflation is less than that same 0.28% - 1.06% range (if the US enters a weakly inflationary or deflationary environment, very common during recession) TIPS will actually lose principal value. I-bonds are set up so that even in a deeply deflationary environment they have a guarantee not to lose any value.

Finally there is the tax management. Most bonds like TIPS have their interest taxed the year it is earned. With I-bonds you do not have to pay tax on the interest until you redeem the bond, which can be as long as 30 years (but you get to choose when). Deferring taxes is invaluable if your income is high, you could wait for a year where your income tax rate is lower to redeem, or you could just defer as long as possible and invest the money you save on taxes today to make additional return on your investment.They are government bonds offered directly through the treasury which if held until maturity (20 years) double in value. This means that if you hold them until maturity they have an equivalent annual interest rate of 3.5% which is drastically higher than the current 20 year treasury rate of 1.1%.Check out my other post in this thread that explains why I-bonds are vastly superior to TIPS. The time is only wasted if you can't be bothered to deploy your capital in the way that makes you the most money. There aren't any circumstances where TIPS make you more money than I-bonds unless you are a trader speculating on interest rates.

https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/htgry2/what_are_the_safe_lowvolatility_securities_in/fyhjgk4/?context=3I'm not very knowledgeable. I'm as curious as you as to what the answer is. 

[This](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=290766) is an interesting post on Bogleheads.org (run by the authors of the Bogleheads book, which is awesome; their discussion board is excellent, and their wiki is crammed with information). Basically, lower (or zero) interest rate means bond funds increase in value as the bonds themselves become more valuable, while income goes towards zero, and vice versa.

It's important to note that bonds don't follow the federal funds rate exactly. There are many factors, as I understand it. One of which is that while current bonds become less desirable, existing bonds will become more desirable. That's because existing bonds' interests are fixed. If you own a bond at 1% and bond rates go to zero, that bond will still pay 1% to maturity, making it more valuable than a new bond that pays 0%. BND's average duration right now is about 6 years, so it's not like BND immediately drops.

Investopedia has a [great article](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/why-interest-rates-have-inverse-relationship-bond-prices/) about bonds and interest rates.I "expect" any investment-grade, nominal bond fund to yield exactly its effective yield if held to maturity.

Obviously, that's not going to happen in real-life, but it's the average outcome. Sometimes, yields fall and I beat the expectation. Other times, yields rise and I underperform.

What really matters is how the entire portfolio performs. At least in the past 45 years, yields have risen in response to a strong economy (which carries the stock market with it) and fallen due to economic uncertainty (dragging down the stock market). Therefore, the long-duration Treasuries have been an outstanding diversifier for a stock portfolio.

In the future, that may or may not be the case. It's quite possible that stagflation takes hold, and long-term bonds and stocks both suffer. Hedges for that include real assets (TIPS, REITs, etc.) and fixed-rate mortgages.Can you please do yourself a favor and learn about bond characteristics? Just looking at charts isn't doing anything for you.

That's before considering things like covariance.That’s not my argument. My argument is when high inflation happens again, there will a response from the Fed which will devalue TIPs, so any gains they make from the increased inflation will be offset by interest rate rises.Yields are much lower with TIPS than normal bonds, so yes there would be a counter effect to high rates and high inflation and it’s possible the rise in inflation is not counteracted by the higher rates. 

Especially true since TIPS I believe track CPI, which tends to give lower numbers than say RPI. Nothing is a free lunch.Keep in mind that TIPS fluctuate based on the *real* yield curve in addition to CPI inflation. If *nominal* yields rise, that doesn't matter.

If inflation spikes, I'd expect real yields to fall, because people are going to start demanding the inflation protection that TIPS provide. They'd benefit from the inflation and from falling real rates, even while nominal rates rise in response to inflation.More than likely yes.We also have double-digit unemployment which is deflationary.

When inflation rises again, interest rates will likely follow.Deflation, at least short to mid term, seems just as likely.Buy property?LK started in 2017, IPOed in 2019, had no moat and never posted a profit. It had just some absurd ambitions (it said in 2019 that it wanted to open 2500 stores in that year - that's 7 stores a day)
Putting your money on such a stock is just gambling.

T on the other hand, has a strong balance sheet, is in S&P100, is a divident aristocrat, has a strong moat and a diversified business model.

If you do not want to take the unsystematic risk of selling options on a company, the same method i described in my OP can be applied on ETFs with options chains.I didn't knew about that, I just found her story inspiring. Thank you for the link!Nice, what capital you have to play with?Mainly being able to cash out with less risk of being down at that exact moment ( if you need cash ASAP ) and buying the stock at a dip not the current price.Fair play I suppose it just depends on the propertyGiven they had over a billion flowing into these funds, I would be shocked if Schwab and others don't jump on offering their own versions.Did you check these or just throw out random guesses? They also fell a similar amount. If you want low risk, you need to accept low return.I didn’t mean to imply that you were wrong. Just that there are risks that come with investing in property. It can be a  safe investment. I’d invest in property here, but most of my assets are tied up in retirement accounts, and our current house. My wife is also fairly risk adverse, so it’s taking a Lot of convincing. If you don’t mind could you share how you got started?There is no inflation compared to when a mentality of hedging against inflation was formed (in the 80s with CPI at 23% never lower than 16%). The 1.6-1.7% we've had since the GFC is nothing.Wouldn't get near them . Did hear about them on the newsThanks for adding more context.

So I hold REITs as well in tax advantaged accounts (~20% of my Roth IRA) but having a majority of 401K/retirement account be REITs seems extremely risky.

Being "in the green" isn't really a meaningful datapoint without added background, my 401K is simply Vanguard 2050, its also "well in the green" (10% averaged over the last decade). The added risk of only/mainly REITs in 401K over a more diversified holding is huge, for potentially minimal upside.Because there's spg green and then there's amzn green.  Not the same thing.Not when considered as a small piece of a larger portfolio which I believe OP explained in a separate comment.Well I'm not going TIPS either.... Some other people were discussing it. 5 years (min) locked up money at a garbage rate, where do I not sign? Unless we start printing trillion dollar bills at the Treasury, there are better options.I'm not aware of any savings account paying much of any interest right now.  My E-Trade account used to pay 2.5%-3% but right now it's below 0.1%.  Find me one though, I need to move my money to somewhere that makes some damned money!Saying what they are 'right now' is misleading. They track inflation. When inflation is 1%, they return 1%. When inflation is 5%, they'll return 5%. Cash might do marginally better at this particular moment of low inflation, but if inflation returns to even historical averages around 3% I Bonds will do better. They'll also offer protection if inflation spikes above historical levels. They offer you a flat real return, which is higher than TIPS or Treasuries and most savings accounts most of the time. I Bonds are IMHO one of the few free lunches out there on the bond side.

Also, after 1 year I Bonds can be cashed out with just a 3-month interest penalty. They are quite liquid. After five years, there's no penalty. But none of that has mattered to me as I've been buying the maximum allowable by law for over a decade now. But if I did need the money, I could sell some of my older ones with no penalty because of the ladder I've created. I also recommend looking into EE bonds which double after 20 years (an effective return of around 3.5%/year, which is far higher than other bonds). Those do, however, have less liquidity.Less liquid , you can sell them back to the government for cash at any time , not sure how that is far less liquid there will always be a buyerIf you lose interest they are not as liquid as a savings account. It's basically a CDYes, I looked at [price movements during COVID-19](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/htgry2/what_are_the_safe_lowvolatility_securities_in/fygtqwo/) and TIPS responded about the same as any safe, high-grade bond fund like $BND: initial drop followed by a quick (about two weeks) recovery. Good enough for me.Thanks, I'm leaning towards using a TIPS fund like VAIPX for my long-term emergency fund since I don't see much of an advantage of I-bonds over TIPS, and TIPS are simply more convenient since I can buy them through my Vanguard account.So I don’t have much money to put away (only a couple hundred) but I’m in my early 20’s so I could see it double in my 40s. Would those types of bonds be a good idea?For EE bonds bought from May 1, 2020, through October 31, 2020, the rate is 0.10%.There are very few 20 year periods where stocks returned less than than 3.5%

So almost in every case you just buy stocks and don't sell for 20 yearsIf you value your time, you would put the $10,000 into a new bank account that offers a $400 or so bonus, then after the bonus period (60 or 90 days) deposit the same money into another account and keep only minimum in the old one to avoid fees

Opening an account and managing each $10K takes time, so if you spend the time, you will be rewarded.

FWIW yields going negative made my TIPS purchase last year much more profitable than I series bonds. It cuts both waysSure. Any good book for a casual investor?  I'm just looking to hold them long term, not actively trade them.Got it. So buy short-term TIPS then. Vanguard's research also confirms that short-term TIPS and commodities are the best hedges against inflation.Too much work, and I tend to move around a lot. I thus prefer securities.Never said it was smart. Just saying if youre unlucky and pick a LK GE or KHC, it can end badly.If you need cash, sell the stock. I like your options strategy, but I like it better while owning the shares. Make it a collar and I like it even more.I’m sure, when shit hit the fan back in March some of these funds were priced very interestingly. I called them up and they said they had retail investors and advisors calling them non stop. Maybe he was just trying to sell, but clearly others see value in these productsAgreed . That's the point with bonds too.If your leveraging the property with a mortgage, it is a substantial risk. If you intend to live in a property, at least you know it will be occupied and protect you from rent. If you want exposure to real estate, REITs require no work from you and have a much lower risk over a long time period. Market volatility happens, but people only think the physical real estate is safer because they don't have a steam of daily pricing offers coming their way.[removed]No inflation by definition is none 0% or deflation.

Right now a 10 year Treasury yeilds a -1.3% real yield. Savings over time would lose ground to inflation.> The added risk of only/mainly REITs in 401K over a more diversified holding is huge, for potentially minimal upside.

I hold a very large diversified portfolio of total stock market ETFs (VTI + VXUS) in a taxable account already. So the logic is that my overall holdings are very well diversified, so I just allocate the least tax efficient part (the REITs) to the tax advantaged account.

I agree that having your entire portfolio in REITs is very risky and not something a responsible advisor would recommend.We just did print trillions at the fed...Ally Bank is paying me 1% right now.  It was 2.2% a year ago.  Also, I really like Ally.  They do a good job and their UX is solid.  Every other bank I've used is stuck in the 90s.Ally still pays 1%Discover is 1%Citibank pays me 1.15%. I started with 1.55% just 3 months ago and they have been steadily dropping their rates buts it's higher than a lot of major banks savings account rates.it's not misleading.  it's true.  it's 1.06% at this moment.  i even cited my source!  Goddamn.  You are correct though--Ally doesn't track with inflation (which had very little to do with my comment).

Just imagine how much money you'd have if you had invested in stocks instead of bonds for the last decade.I might be wrong but I believe you have to hold them for a year before you can sell them.There's a rule of 72 that helps figure out how much compound interest grows. Divide the growth rate by 72 and that's the number of years it takes to double. It's eye opening to see how much yield affects it over a long period of time. 


If you're growing 7% per year then every 10 years you double. Starting at 25 you'll double at 35, 4x at 45, 8x at 55, and 16x at 65.

If it's 3% then you'll double every 24 years. Starting at 25 you'll double at 49 and hit 4x at 74.


If your growth is 10% you'll double every 7 years. Starting at 25 you'll double at 32, 4x at 39, 8x at 46, 16x at 53, 32x at 60, and 64x at 67.If you're looking for long-term growth you are probably best served by investing in a retirement account and putting that money into stocks (eg total stock market index fund). However once you already own a lot of stocks I do think that EE bonds can be a good next step to provide some diversification. Doubling your money in 20 years is good compared to other bonds, but I would expect stocks to quadruple in 20 years (of course nobody knows what stocks will do, but I think this is a reasonable estimate).That’s the interest rate if you cash in before maturity. If held 20 years the bond value doubles. The low interest rate before maturity is why you shouldn’t buy EE bonds if you think there is a substantial risk you will need to redeem them before maturity.

> Treasury guarantees that for an electronic EE Bond with a June 2003 or later issue date, after 20 years, the redemption (cash-in) value will be at least twice the purchase price of the bond.

https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eeratesandterms_eebondsissued052005andafer.htm#whenThat last part is very important> If you value your time, you would put the $10,000 into a new bank account that offers a $400 or so bonus

What? Every time you do that it requires a new 1099-INT on your taxes. Not to mention finding the bank account bonuses, opening accounts and abiding by the fine print of the terms of the bonus, and exposing your personal information to more data breaches and identity theft opportunities annually.

> Opening an account and managing each $10K takes time

You have to open an account to buy TIPS as well, either through a banker, broker, or with the treasury in the exact same account you'd use for I-bonds. Managing each $10k takes me 10 minutes a year.

> It cuts both ways

Only if you sell them, which takes time, undercutting your original argument. If you hold them to maturity it doesn't cut both ways at all. You're speculating on interest rates, which is exactly what my original comment pointed out (maybe read it closer).[deleted]> Vanguard's research also confirms that short-term TIPS and commodities are the best hedges against inflation

Very interesting. Do you have a link for more information about this?That would lessen interest rate risk, but yields are still a lot less than short term bonds. I suppose it’s a good use to preserve wealth.

Gold I can see as an inflation hedge, but not all commodities.Short-term TIPS have the highest *correlation* to inflation, but they aren't necessarily the best hedge.

For a longer-term investor, long-duration TIPS protect real value with less reinvestment risk and higher real yields. Those are probably the better inflation hedge, even if the correlation to inflation is weaker.Have a link by any chanceYeah, having a property would lock you down and cost a great deal in agent cost for moving around.

The only superior strategy would be holding the S&P500

Back in the days of 23% CPI it was either equities or bust. You couldn't touch bonds.That strategy makes sense!

That said its impressive if your holdings outside of 401K are larger than the 401K itself..Something can be both true and misleading. In the case of I Bonds, which track inflation, your statement could be confusing, so I clarified and elaborated. As for stocks versus bonds last decade - I did both, thanks. I also did both the decade before that in which bonds beat US stocks by a wide margin (US stocks had negative returns that decade). I also rebalanced from bonds to stocks and back again during this year's dip and am ahead for doing so. If you're an all-stock person, that's your call, but some of us prefer a smoother right and to hedge downturns.Yes what is why I specified 5 years, but after a year you can redeem them as cash so liquidity is unlimitedI buy a fund in my brokerage, so everything is from one place.

Asaik there arent any drawn up ETF's though.OP, you meant to ask "ETF's or Mutual Funds". An index fund tracks just that...an index. (S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 100 and so on). An index fund can be either an Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) or Mutual Fund.I highly doubt there are enough stocks in this field to cause there to be an ETFI can’t answer the question off the top of my head but this is a very good, forward-thinking question.I usually check etf.com you can look up specific stocks and then check what etfs have exposure and how much.Even a good, revolutionary, correct idea can bankrupt you if you get in too early. 

I think it's way early. You aren't going to see any returns for 20 years, if at all. Keep that in mind and proceed carefully.[deleted]Check out agronomics, they're invested quite heavily in the lab grown meat sector.Even if there was I personally find the field too volatile. It seems to me this is a tech that unknown companies are going to have breakthroughs in and then dominate and that it is far too early to tell who will win.Well, it will happen thanks to precision fermentation:

“RethinkX projects collapse of dairy & cattle industries by 2030 as animal meat is replaced by cheaper, higher quality food made from precision fermentation protein.”


https://www.rethinkx.com/press-release/2019/9/16/new-report-major-disruption-in-food-and-agriculture-in-next-decadeLab meat is still a research project though (and I’d guess is still years away for something commercial).

You won’t find any public company that focuses on this, let alone an ETF full of them. The best you can do is as you noted, large companies who are spending a small part of their R&D budget in this research.I don't see a future in lab meat and I will explain why. First is the current state of meats is to cut out hormones and antibiotics weighed against the ethics of farm raised animals. Cell culture media is the perfect media to grow bacteria to counter this you spike your media with several antibiotics. Without the antibiotics the bacteria would overtake the culture in hours. Next in order to get animal cells to actually grow in that media you also have supply the hormones, amino acids, etc necessary to get the cells to grow. There are some sources for these additives but they are expensive. The rest are usually isolated from the blood of slaughter animals. Bovine calf serum is fairly commonly necessary for many cell lines. Lastly cell culture is used to working with immortalized(cancerous) cell lines. These cell lines unusually don't have a working cell death mechanism and so you can have very high numbers of passages while being fairly stable genetics and phenotypes. High passages still do result in changes. With fresh cell lines the number of passages is severely reduced with genetic degradation occurring within a few passages(generations/divisions). You also are still going to need a source for fresh cells but one animal could probably supply enough to grow hundreds of animals worth of material. 

The last reason is actually the biggest hurdle, regulatory. With increased risk of microbial contamination, presence of several medications and FDA oversight(biologics) your going to see the cost of manufacturing these meats approaching that of medication. The producer is going to have to test for the levels of the antibiotics and hormones, and the absence of pathogens. 

In the end your going to have a product that going to be more expensive than traditional meat and loaded with more antibiotics. It's a poison pill really. Look at MedImmunes flumist. On paper, and prior to quadravalent, it was better than it's competitors and didn't require an injection, it was a nasal spray vaccine. It had better results than inactivated flu but it was a live attenuated vaccine and because of the word live it was not a commercial success. People believed it gave them the flu with symptoms, it actually only grew in your nasal passages, so it did not generate great sales and was really a charity product, with amazing technology licensing income, for the company. Many years it was a net loss.The only one publicly traded is BYND so no. 

TSN, ADM and other big ag/good names all have some ownership stakeFXGWhat you read /hear is a shortage of raw material for that. At the moment that's mainly soya and other beans and peas. That may be an alternative, though these are not the parties that add the most value to this product..I don't know of any index funds, but one ticker worth checking out is FMCI. They are a private "meatless" company that is currently going through the /r/spacs process of being public. The said company announced is *Tattooed Chef* and shares will be discounted until the process is finilazed. Check out the SPACS sub if you're not familiar with the process. *Tattooed Chef* has great financials and has landed some sizeable contracts!

Edit: FWIW  I own stock in them and will be holding long termMany meat firms also now produce meatless. So depends on if this is more ethical or just want to own anything meatless. But if you’re referring to more of a lab petri-dish grown meat, that’s probably more biotech of sorts. Like cloning.Beyond Mean (BYND) has been pretty volatile recently, if you're day-trading you can easily make some profit but I'm not sure what the long-term prospects are, given they're the first but likely not going to be the best once the science & industry is more established.I think Tyson is vastly undervalued for various reasons.  Robotics and plant-based chicken won't catch upMake a slice on M1 fiance and call it No Meat ETF, allocate the percentage and there's your index, plus no expense ratio.Defiance had the DIET ETF but it's been discontinued.

They do private funding rounds but I think the minimum is like $1 million to get invested.Goo salesman!It’s still a new area. Give it some timeStash has a cool option that allows you to browse funds based on principals and ethics. I dont remember but they might have a fund focused on the agriculture industry in the ethical fund category. You wouldn't need to buy it through Stash, just getting the  name of the fund from them.I would invest in plant based meat alternative instead of pure lab grown. There's a way higher social stigma for the latter from both the vegans, vegetarians and meat eaters.Index funds are great for more established areas, most early lab grown meat companies will failHonestly, I don't think cultured meat is even realistic yet. I think you're better off going in on the good plant-based ones like Beyond/Impossible. Also, look out for changes in meat subsidies. There is a very large price difference between meat and plant-based substitutes because of subsidies for the meat industry, and the lack of efficient supply chains for what are relatively new plant-based products. Those companies are improving their supply chains fairly quickly, but if meat loses subsidies, or plant-based gains subsidies, it's a whole new ballgame.$MEATLolBYNDJust go VOO for the win. Green investing. 😔I have a decent amount in Tyson. I think it's going to do well and they'll buy into whatever becomes their competition.i would saying invest in BYND for now. closest thing to meat alternatives that is on the market and it’s boomingHold my beer while I attempt to replicate the entire metabolism of a ruminant in a lab _and_ try to beat a couple of million years of finely tuned evolution to somehow do it better.

Heaven forbid we chuck a cow in some grassland and eat it 2 years later.Why would you want to invest in this?This is purely anecdotal but I would never eat lab grown meat. It just sounds bad in my ears.I don't think these companies will do well. Their products won't be consumed by the masses and will be overpriced for it to really gain any traction

It's one of those things that looks good on paper, but would have to be in every grocery store and cheaper than farm meat to be practical.I'm not too comfortable with Tyson or ADM, but I guess Allegiant is a decent way to get some exposure.The advantage of ETFs is that you have far less transaction fees.

For buying an ETF I pay about 10 $ (10 CHF) transaction fee, or about 30 if I have to buy it abroad. For a stock it's about 30 $. That means if I want to "create" my own ETF with 10 stocks, it's 300 $ transaction fees.Thanks for pointing this out. I have been making this mistake too.Yes thank you. I did mean mutual fundsYou are correct. Unless there is some private equity company that has managed to get some stake in the private companies, there is no way to get exposure to them until they become public.There a nano cap Organovo. It is ticker is ONVO. It is not exactly what you are looking for. They print meat for farmaceutical companies.

They are a cash eating machine too. Bought many years ago more than 80% down.I just wish I could by future meat technologies.  They have a decent price point according to a few sources. They are aiming for 10$/lb by the end of 2022.It depends on the shift in awareness of the general populus, the hype that follows a shift in awareness is very real and provide big short term gains. Tesla are an amazing example of this.Many thought the same thing about Tesla.   But someone needs to go ahead and invest majorly in the new way of doing things.  Whoever goes all in first has a good chance.    The toe dipping strategy isn't going to make a market leader.Yeah, at this stage you want to be working with the company to show your support rather than buying ETFs. Direct investment this far up the road is going to be roulette but at least you're reaching the development.It looks like it will already happen during this decade: 

“Precision fermentation (PF) is a process that enables the programming of micro-organisms to produce almost any complex organic molecule. Its costs are dropping exponentially because of rapid improvements in underlying biological and information technologies. The cost to produce a single molecule using PF has fallen from $1 million per kilogram in 2000, to about $100 today. Assuming existing technologies and using well-established cost curves, the report projects that these costs will fall below $10 per kilogram by 2025, and that these proteins will be five times cheaper than traditional animal proteins by 2030 and 10 times cheaper by 2035.”Buy big meat cause ultimately they will gobble up the disruptorsEver hear of $BIOL? A few years back, I really thought the world (or rather, its dentists) were ready to move on from power drilling their teeth to [lasers](https://media.makeameme.org/created/frickin-laser-beams-5a72a4.jpg). At this rate, I'll be wearing dentures by the time they take off, if ever.People are saying that about Tesla and Space nowThat's not cultured/lab meat though, BYND is plant-based meat. I think OP means literally creating meat in a Petri dish.KFC is sounding pretty good. I read today that they are going to try "bioprinting" chicken nuggets with some Russian lab.Ugh. Good info I guess but disappointed that a proper vegan etf apparently doesn’t exist yetVEGN is basically an S&P 500 fund with a 10x markupNice find. I thought I was one of the only few that is eyeing this stock.I have found out that you are right. Most companies dedicated to this effort are still very private. But there are some lab meat available at roughly 12$/lb meaning that it's getting close to affordable. Until it's cheaper though it won't be profitable.I appreciate it. Thank you.Non dairy drinks are a potential option for plant based dietary investments. Eg Blackstone’s investment in Oatly.I have a small stake in FMCI also, but they are a completely different thing than BYND or private Impossible Foods. They will be a great company, but not a distruptor in the field.I am thinking they are safest way to go with the above goal in mind, while not wanting to risk losing money hand over fist.Thank you, thats awesome advice. Now all I need is for some of the companies to go public.Thank you, I'll look into some of those companies.I would literally try to create a fund just to invest in these companies.That does sound really cool. I'm actually somewhat concerned that I might not understand the science of lab grown meat based on a few comments in this thread.I feel like once it exists and is cost effective based on the competing products (plant based and conventional meat) it will find it's market. I personally feel that if the planetary costs are gone the incentive to be a vegetarian or vegan is reduced, but not obsolete. Meat eaters are a weird group in that I don't think people identify as a meat eater and most will just focus on raw cost. Most likely (if) lab grown meat will not be labeled and thus will be purchased. 

This thread has opened my eyes to the fact that people are incredibly divided on the actual efficiency and health benefits of the product, so I've determined its way too early for dedicated investing.PPC, SAFM, Bachoco, Maple Leaf etc. do you not do any research?Tyson does the exact opposite of what this person is interested inSo far in the Midwest it isn’t booming. When stores were getting picked clean of meat the beyond meat sections were completely full of untouched marked down food products. 

The biggest issue I see with fake meat is that everyone is going for an all natural product line and fake meat is packed full of chemicals.More like heaven forbid we make space for and feed 70 billion animals per year, and growing.The impacts for the planet are immense. People care about factory farming and animal waste products. Just not enough to inconvenience themselves or spend more money on the problem. If a meat came out that was cheaper than these meats and was equal to factory farmed meat without those costs, they would buy it as long as it tastes the same. 

And as an added bonus the meat could be based on animals that don't eat pesticide covered crops or get jammed full of antibiotics.Is cultured meat better?FUCK TYSONUh beyond?MorningStar Farms? (Aka Kellogg)

MapleLeaf Foods? 

Sweet Earth Foods (aka Nestle)?What's wrong with Tyson? I think they're a great company with a bright future. But that's just my humble opinion, being invested in them for a while.Why are you still paying transaction fees?Well, that all depends on your broker, since a lot of online brokers nowadays are no-commission/no-fee when trading stocks, like E-trade, TD Ameritrade, Schwab, InteractiveBrokers, etc.

So it could be better to directly buy the stocks, but that's up to the individual and how much capital they have.Damn thats expensive af, I pay 0.15% commisson, domestic or foreing.My dad is in venture capital and has stake in a private company that is doing cultured meats.. unfortunately I'd rather not say which one it is publically. I'd assume most of these companies are private with venture capital money so it would be nearly impossible to find an ETF.Interesting. Thanks! 80% down does not necessarily mean a thing in the long run. They seem to be leading in the field. I'm wondering why it's unprofitable and the state of its product. Is it production ready? How do the organs compare to transplants in terms of rejections and function? Which organs are printed? I'll do some reading myself too.Keep looking, keep asking. Youll find them eventually, even if there arent enough yet. 
Also beware thematic ETFs when they are THAT special or specific, and who runs them. Anyway, good question!The cost isn't really what's stopping people from buying that now. It only appeals to a niche market. Nobody is seriously substituting it for meat unless they are health consious. People love meat and it's not going anywhere. These companies are a terrible buy IMOThat sentence gives me the heebie jeebies.Yeah I'm just thinking from a macro perspective and also the demand for chicken won't go down (unless there is a chicken flu outbreak).  I don't like red meat 🥩 and the fake meat and red meat industry can duke it out.  Tyson has ~33% of the poultry market and has strong operating cash flows.  They will survive.  Hopefully no foreign nation buys them out like SmithfieldI know this but they're going to do well and will probably buy into what he's looking for in the future. Good buy and hold imo.A majority of the land on earth is not arable for traditional crops but is suitable for grasslands which can raise ruminants. You just plop them down and they make food; moreover ruminants are symbiotic with grassland ecosystems. Remove them and you get desertification.That’s cool but do you have any reasons you think these will be good businesses? Seems like they will require a lot of capex initially and will likely have no pricing power.Except the fact that if it is grown in a lab it is going to be the same as eating chemical. There are withdraw periods for antibiotics. Like every profession, a few bad apples gives the entire industry a bad name. So called factory farms have animals living in climate controlled buildings where they receive care 24/7.No but it's lesser of two evils. IMO. 

I try to eat as much as plant based as possible but I supplement with chicken, turkey and eggs. I think that's the optimal diet.This random stranger supports this message and would like to add

FUCK EVERY COMPANY THAT OPERATES FACTORY FARMSI feel it's overvalued and isn't cultured meat focused. They are sticking to plant based meat.I like that they have actual cash flow and are trying to innovate. I was trying to get a pure clean meat or heavily clean meat company. But if I don't think that clean meat will be profitable for a decade then they are the best play to have some exposure and growth while I wait.As an straight $ investment maybe, but as a green investment, they don’t even come close to what OP is looking for.I also like their P/E ratio right nowThey seem rather focused on exploiting cognizant animals at the moment still. I hadn't heard about any major plans to go plant based or lab grown.  Of I did hear of that, id consider investing.I heated up their chicken nuggets in the microwave, and they lit on fire. Never again.I came in so late I’ve never paid them.That is normal isn't it? Or how would your broker and the stock exchange earn money otherwise?

I am using one of the cheapest Brokers available in my country (Switzerland).

Brokers from abroad (e.g. Germany, Netherlands) have lower transaction fees but they still have them, so it's usually a lot cheaper to buy an ETF than to buy several stocks.

That would be different if the transaction fee was purely percentage-wise and not flat because then it would not matter if you buy 1 position for 10k or 10 positions for 1k each.It seems to appear so. We have the full power of Reddit and haven't found an option. 

P.S: is your dad looking for investors?The business side seems to be in shambles after massive layoffs in 2019 and a failed merger in 2020. Oh well. Worth watching, not worth buying.

They are generating revenue from selling liver and kidney tissue for drug testing from what I could gather.

I might throw a small sum in their direction after I've crunched some numbers.And at the point that they're that specific, just look at its holding and mimic it with your own personal little ETF and keep the expense fees to yourself.Somebody seems to have missed how vegetarians are 10% of several major countries and have increased 6x in the US!

Still not a huge number, but people are more concerned with the conditions of factory farming than you realize. They’d normally just eat “good” high quality meat, from a good source, but lab grown is cool. It’s supermarket bargain meat that’s in trouble.Just wait till it is cheaper then real meat. Cost is what 99% of people care about (walmart, amazon, fast food, etc..)> Nobody is seriously substituting it for meat unless they are health consious.

There are those that are absolutely those that are substituting it for meat to lower their environment cost to meat.  I still eat meat, just not all the time.  I'm a fan and consumer of both Beyond Meat and Impossible. 

Depending on your definition of "healthy" some of the plant based meat substitutes aren't really that different on the health side than meat.We're only a few years away from "Oryx and Crake" becoming a reality.[deleted]Smithfield was a tragedy, but at least I can bacon at publix for 3$ a pack when it's buy one get one free.I'd be interested in a breakdown of, for example, the US percentage of feedlot vs ranged animals, irrigation and the toll they take on waterways, and the like. While grazing animals are required to maintain a healthy ecosystem, it's generally in smaller numbers moderated by predators to about the damage herbivores can do to landscapes (Yellowstone), or to avoid famine cycles from overpopulation (isle royale). The monoculture and fertilizing of feed farms is also hugely damaging to waterways, a local example being runoff to lake Erie. Add to that growing animal protein consumption worldwide and the clear cutting of forests to provide pasture, I think it's a valuable research path to identify if we can recreate the good stuff. A quick scan shows about 32kwh energy equivalent to produce a pound of beef - that's a lot.I believe that vegetarians will eat meat the meat and if it is able to become cheaper than factory farmed meat it will be able to take the majority of the sector. It will also drastically reduce the need for several other industries in transportation, chemicals. I believe this will free up resources at massive level for other intitatives.But, if they are never alive there would not need to reason to use a cow from a factory farm as the original cell. So you could find a grass fed, or a non pesticide fed animal.So you wouldn't eat something that is the exact same as what you usually eat, down to a molecular level, without any of the antibiotics/steroids, without needing to 'grow' animals,  that will eventually be able to produced in mass much cheaper, without having to produce cow farms that harm the ozone, and lakes full of animal waste , all because it doesn't sound good to you 🤔Jah bless you my friend!factory farms are terrible, but it's the logical conclusion of a society that demands meat. if Tyson stopped tomorrow they would go out of business and someone else would take over. blame the people who consume meat as their primary caloric source, not the company that supplies the demand.I never really understood the point of cultured meat. It seems a lot easier and cheaper to make a meat substitute that tastes like meat and has similar nutrition content than it would be to grow meat in a labYou’re never going to find an ETF to meet your needs if you’re this picky.Beyond is not overvalued. While I personally don't buy the studies that say eating that way is healthy, I think everyone else on the planet will. It was just like 6 or 9 months ago that Gretta, whatever her name was was speaking on climate change change, and as I recall, something like 17 million more plant eaters were switched over from beef.Plants are better for you! Lab meat and animal meat has cholesterol. Plants don't have any cholesterol and are better for your heart. The future is plant based meat and maybe small quantities of the real thing. 

Lab meat takes a ton of resources and CO2 to grow. I used to work in a cell culture lab. Contamination was always an issue unless you add antibiotics. It's expensive and not practical, unless you're doing research or trying to cure cancer or something. Maybe nutritional yeast, but not lab grown meat, it's not practical.

If you don't like beyond you can also go with FMCI. There are a few public plant-based meat companies in Canada as well.As a vegetarian, lab grown meat sounds grim.I especially like the fact that they're diversified. They've shown results, as you mentioned yourself, their p/e ratio is great as well. I truly believe they can break the 100$ mark by the end of 2020.> exploiting cognizant animals 

Tyson works with chickens.  Chickens are literally considered pests in some areas. If you don't know, chicken in large groups will kill each other.  They might be worse than humans.Growing up I got beat over the head with the "$7 Dollar trades" commercials, they were all over the place. So ten years later when I started investing I saw a bunch of companies offering zero transaction fees. I thought "huh, thats a good deal, they used to cost $7" not like i ever paid the fee.No, in the US these days brokers do not charge any transaction fees.Not sure how non-US brokers work since I'm only familiar with the companies here, but I think it was last year that most of the larger US brokers went to $0 commission for domestic equity/ETF trades.

There are other ways brokers make money than just commissions from trading stock. When TD Ameritrade went to $0 commissions they announced an expected hit to revenue of ~15%, which was on the high side compared to another broker like Schwab where the number was closer to ~5% loss of revenue (I could be a tad off on those %, doing from memory when all the merger talk was going on).Yes, but generally looking for pension funds of the government of X or large companies like Pepsi with an investment group. Would need to have at least million+ to invest. Each fund round is around $150 million.That's what I did. I threw a small sum 5 years ago. I keep it to remember that sometimes you kind of lost it all.You might want to hold your horses. I was all ready to invest BUT the AGM authorised the board for a Reverse Split earlier this year. 1:20 or 40 . That's why I held off. Price has been going up so might not if it gets to a dollar. Was worth way more at IPO?Thats an idea im playing with around the MJ etf from those GERM dudes, I like the industry, the ideals and the potential... I just hate holding individual CannStocks. If you can dig it.Actually vegetarianism hasn't really increased that much in the past 20 years, especially on a global level as people in developing countries have more disposable income. This is an old article, so maybe has changed in the past 2 years, but a lot of the news about the rise of vegetarianism and veganism is misleading - https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/food/wp/2018/08/03/you-might-think-there-are-more-vegetarians-than-ever-youd-be-wrong/Nah I don't think you have a good read on this at all. Meat is delicious and consumers are always going to prefer real meat to some fake soy meat.If cost is what people care about then they wouldn't be eating meat to begin with. Feel free to invest your money how you want but I would make a 1 share of Amazon bet right now that in 5 years my gossip fuel portfolio will outperform ANY fake meat company.Same... I pretty much limit my meat and dairy consumption to local farm at 4x the price>lower their environment cost to meat

We aren't seeing any dips in meat sales Nationwide so I really doubt any significant portion of the country is doing this. When the COVID hit I went to grocery store and the meat section was a ghost town....except for all the fake soy meat crap. Literally nobody wants it. Seems like a terrible investment hoping people change their eating habits "for the environment"...The amount of energy required to produce a pound of beef is only relevant insofar as that energy is taken from a source that is valuable. So if there’s some grass sitting there that contains a certain amount of energy, that’s sortof irrelevant unless it was possible to feed that grass to a human or do other particularly useful things with it. If you take a typical “grain finished” cow, the amount of grain concentrate required to fatten that cow is typically around 2 lbs per lb of finished beef product. The remaining 95% of the feed comes from roughage and non-food grade waste from the agricultural system like soybean leaves. Removing animals from the agricultural system drastically increases the amount of plant matter waste, for example. The resulting animal protein provides substantially more nutrition in terms of amino acid portfolio and bioavailable vitamins and minerals than the food consumed. 

The grazing pattern is important insofar as predators or similar influence are required in order to maintain tight herds and migration before the ruminants overgraze the grass. But that doesn’t necessarily speak to the carrying capacity of the land since improperly grazed land due to all the predators being murdered may give the appearance of excess grazing when in fact the influences causing the overgrazing were orthogonal to the number of ruminants per se.

Tldr incredibly interesting topic, nuance rarely captured.That’s cool and I hope it happens but it seems to me like it’s just another commodity businessI’ve never heard of any animal fed a pesticide. Ever. In the past you could use medicated feed, but in order to do that a vet has to write a referral. That has cut down on medication use tremendously.I wouldn't eat it but that doesn't stop the other 7 billion other people that would eat it.I blame every link in the chain from the farmer to the consumer.The meat industry lobbies for specific gag laws making it illegal to share footage of factory farms.  If they didn’t do this, and there was regulation to require better conditions for food animals, the price for meat would go up and consumption would go down.

It’s not just the consumer to blame, it’s also crony capitalism and regulatory capture.People want to eat real meat. They just don't want to kill animalsI believe in the benefits that it will have on meat eaters because it will drastically change supply chains and the amount of waste products from animals (cows and methane).“Easier and cheaper” isn’t always necessarily the answer to something unless your only goal is to make money. The point of lab grown meat is that people want to have red meat without destroying the Earth or hurting animals. In that endeavor, easier and cheaper will never be enough of reason to settle for a meat “substitute”. If you’re able to solve said problem, the money will come eventually and much more than if you just substituted for meat.I've had a lot of burger substitutes and lately tired an Impossible burger by itself, no toppings. The Impossible burger was so close to taste and texture to a real burger that I'm not sure I could tell the difference after eating it with all the usual toppings and a bun.Beyond is good but it doesn’t taste like beef. It’s the closest yet to beef texture-wise and that’s why it’s gotten the fanfare it has. They also cannot offer anything besides a ground-meat substitute; they have no product to compete with steak and probably never will. 

Lab-grown fills these holes Beyond can’t.None of them taste like meat, though, and they’re really not that close.  I eat a lot of red meat and a lot of veggie burgers (I like to grill and I’m married to a vegetarian), and while they’ve come a looonnggg way in making the veggie burgers closer to a real burger, it still just really isn’t there.  There are plenty of times I’ll choose a beyond burger over a real burger just so I can cook the same thing for everyone eating dinner, not destroy the environment, and because I think they’re delicious, but they’re not a substitute for a real burger.If we could 3d print live cells into the form of a steak, we’d really have something.  We could reduce the impact of cattle **and** make organs for transplant.  Oh sorry, this is investing not futurology.It's easier and cheaper for people to imagine a story in their head than to pay to see a movie which took hundreds of participants to believably act out to and produce.

Much easier and cheaper to just read a book, even, but that still took a lot more production than if you just ask a person to tell you a story.

I don't get why people pay money for things or work to accomplish arbitrary goals either.Beyond can make a shitty fast food substitute, but it will never make a good steak or chicken parm.I can see the appeal for more than just meat.  If we can grow cultured rhinoceros horn or whale oil, there could be a few new markets to explore...As time progresses the technology will become more viable, there was even talk a while back about it being used on the space station, even a *gags* meat 3D printerMy only experience with beyond meat, I think it was beyond was a White Castle burger on a road trip. It did not taste like meat, even by White Castle standards, it tasted like a pile of saltI mean yeah it's easier and cheaper but it still isn't meat. There's something missing.

Not to mention so much if it is made from soy and that stuff has a lot of carbs in it unlike meatNo plant-based meat will ever taste like or have the texture of real meat, unless you generously douse it in animals fats. Even then something is going to be off.Meat your needs*I literally just wanted a diverse holding and not a specific company.17 million based on emotional appeal is likely to not last in their decision. I argue it's more like a new year's resolution. A lasting solution that actually ends the pollutants or drastically reduces it long term is the answer. 

If you get the same texture and taste in your mouth but don't sacrifice the water, labor, and pollutants in the atmosphere then I argue a much larger impact will be made. 

Beyond being overvalued is a separate argument with the outcome being based on what lab grown meat will do to the plant based meat market. Especially when lab grown meat becomes cheaper than the equivalent in *natural* meat. 

*Factory farms fed an overabundance of antibioticsThank you for more experienced response. I'm not a fan unless the texture can be matched by plant based meat, but your health argument is a good point. 

I'll research FMCI, thank you.If it doesn't have the negative effects on the environment, would you consider it?Sighed really loudly reading this.They might be worse than humans. But we don't farm humans.  At least that is looked down upon.   While they might a lower form of cognizance, does not nessecarily mean they deserve to be farmed for food.How much is the bid-ask spread at US brokers? In my experience within Europe, the brokers with no "fees" can often be more expensive.I don't have that type of power in the DoD.  But i wish. If he would take 1 mil i could make a group that could get that.

Edit: I wish that I could accomplish enough to control the army pension fund. But it's an impossible task. Blackrock really destroyed the bidding game.Yeah, I know it’s a bit muddled by the rise of income elsewhere, but in first world countries the rise does exist. It’s just that the population centers in developing countries more than cancel it out. But point taken. 

In my own experience, though, restaurants serving vegetarian options has increased about 100x in every town in the US I’ve been to in the past few decades. I know that’s obviously not the whole world. But the trend is there for restaurants to at least cater to this demand, even if not driven by an actual increase.

In your article it does discuss people voluntarily **limiting** meat intake, which has seen a tremendous rise. It doesn’t have to be all or nothing.Preferences change. The impossible burger is nearly identical to Whopper meat: have you tried it? It’s like 98% there already. And I love me a good burger, but a whopper isn’t one. Good meat is delicious but people eat low quality meat all the time. I’m just saying, you seem awfully sure of what everyone everywhere thinks, and a good investor looks out for disruptors. There’s also the climate and sustainability argument to be made as well.Great points! I'd love a detailed breakdown of these numbers, if you have any books or articles, please share them. My gut feeling is still on my original point, but those are other wrong and if like to know the scale we can support. Thanks.Pesticide covered crops. So in biomagnification you will develop a large build up of something present in your feed. So if pesticides are put on crops, by eating the crops your animal will have consumed a massive amount of pesticides.Yikesif the company refused, someone else would. if the consumer refused, nobody would. there's really no grounds to blame anyone but people who eat meat.everyone knows factory farms are terrible, yet they keep buying meat. the only "ethical" choice is to never eat animal products again. milk farming is just as brutal as factory conditions, and no matter how nicely you treat your meat cows they still get slaughtered in their prime.In the long run it should also be cheaper and better for the environment. Raising livestock takes a lot of water and food, and there's a lot of pollution created by transporting it all. Plus, all these cow farts have a real impact on the atmosphere.Sure, but people also don't want to get their blood drawn.

When betting on new technology the best bets are on the best technology.  Not on what people want.Not limited to *killing* animals either. There are a large number of other benefits not having to raise livestock to eat meat.Yes but the people actually voting against meat companies with their wallets are eating plant based. People who want cultured meat still eat real meat and talk about how someday they hope they can eat it, while directly opposing its developement by continuing to buy real meat...

It will depend on what companies buy out the startups doing cultured meat i think.I've been following since the $325k hamburger (now costs them $12 to make). IMHO clean meat will have, at a minimum,  as big of an impact to the world as the internet did.Yeah, currently they're way ahead of the competition. I guess the only realistic way for a retail investor to own any is, unfortunately, through buying stocks of institutional investors such as $GOOG who are in through GV.A movie obviously has benefits over imagining something. But I was talking about making meat substitutes that taste the same as meat and have the same nutrition. Lab grown meat would have no benefit in that caseThen you’ll have to be less discerning.No. Natural all the way I'm afraid.Yeah, sometimes facts are tough to hear. Chickens are considered pests in many cities because they reproduce in great numbers. In groups chicken kill each other by pecking each other to death, usually at the mere sight of blood.   So, I will double down for non-meat eaters.

I doubt much of the chicken goes to waste, since pet food and hot dogs exist.  The industry also feeds millions of people a day.They're tasty though.  Plus they're little monsters.  People need to eat.From my experience I've only seen spreads of more than a penny for really thinly traded stocks, like your OTC/pink sheet type stocks.

My guess is the move to commission free is meant to be a "loss leader" of sorts, not just them being sneaky and "hiding" the fee via a bad spread. A broker is fine breaking even/losing some revenue by offering free trades but in doing so gets the opportunity to pitch other products or services that are money makers (advising services, money management, annuities, etc.).

The 'race to zero' has been going on for quite a few years here in the US, with all the big brokers racing to undercut each other on account minimums, trading costs, fund expense ratios, you name it. That's often what gets clients in the door or stops them from considering another broker.The article actually suggests that even within the US vegetarianism hasn't really increased over the past 20 years, but as I mentioned it's now 2 years old and a lot of things (e.g. extinction rebellion, climate activism becoming mainstream, etc.) make me think that things have increased a lot in the past 2 years. Still, another factor to consider is that the vast majority (84% -https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/most-vegetarians-lapse-after-only-year-180953565/) of vegans and vegetarians go back to eating meat eventually. Short term survey results are often highly specific to "that moment in time". E.g. if you survey veganism during climate week, there are probably a lot of people who have recently started because of things they are reading in the news, but if you look at trends over a long period of time it gives you a more accurate picture. One thing that definitely has changed is that people are eating less meat and "flexitarean" or "planetary health" diets have increased. I've even read that the fake meat boom is primarily driven by meat eaters not vegans or vegetarians, which makes sense tbh. I don't really understand why a vegan would seek out fake meat. 

I also wouldn't say that vegetarian options have really increased. They've always been there they are just marketed differently now. Even fake meat options, which I would say HAS increased is not exactly new, brands like Quorn have been around since the 80s.Care to bet on it? One share of Amazon that 5 years from now my fossil fuel portfolio will FAR outproduce any soy meat crap stock?Organic grain is tested more than any crop sold. There is no way of telling if pesticides have been used in any test. There is a difference in GMO and Non GMO, but a non gmo grain that has been sprayed and fertilized synthetically can be sold as organic with no way to prove other wise. That is why I think it is a joke that there is a 100% mark up on organic crops.yikersThat's like blaming every Nazi for the holocaust but not blaming the people running the camps. Shitty take.I don't think it's fair to ignore the role companies have in maintaining the market they supply. Tobacco companies aren't just serving the demand for tobacco, they used marketing to create that demand. Drug dealers aren't just providing the drug someone else already wants they actively take part in "client outreach". Almost every company in every industry has an incentive and a plan to prop up their respective market. Companies that produce meat also take part in that cycle of trying to present meat-farming as palatable, or meat-eating as desirable or necessary, driving up demand.These companies keep the price artificially low based on their unethical practices, which leads to more meat consumption.  If you could only buy free-range beef and it cost $50 a pound, people would still eat meat but would do it more rarely, just like people in less rich countries.That's a fairly extreme position which goes against powerful forces like cultural norms, tradition, and the intrinsic appeal of animal products to the human palette.

Expecting everyone to become vegan is like trying to get everyone to stop having oral sex for some moral reason.  Most people have enough problems in life, and don't have the bandwidth to consider the ethical implications of everything which gives them pleasure.

You can wish for that all you want, but if you actually want any meaningful change in your lifetime, you should support incremental change through increased regulation of the meat industry.Oh absolutely. I imagine once the tech matures and good enough for everyday usage, it should be far more cheaper to lab grow meat than raising a whole living being from birth just to kill it later and remove its usable parts. Efficiency gains would be too much for it to pass up. 

Oh and we wouldn’t be killing animals but that’s secondary to money making....it's actually cow burps.Well then you just hedge with Hiliion and turn those cow farts into fuel!!!!!Imagine the possibilities.  Dinosaur BBQ with real Dinosaur meat.Betamax tapes were better, but people didn't want it.

Early palm pilots were the best tech for mobile devices, but nobody wanted those.

The Zoom was the best tech mp3 player, but nobody wanted that.

Often, the products with the best marketing and distribution win, not the product with the best tech.I'm vegetarian but would love to eat cultured meat if it was available.How in the world do you think clean meat will potentially have a higher impact than the internet???I'm curious what would happen to all the animals. I'm guessing a lot of them would be funneled over to milk production or hide/wool harvesting, but what about the rest?If you made a fake duck that was like a real duck in every discernable way, didn't you just re-invent the duck?

And if you want, the growth and production could be automated with the inclusion of an organic neural network that is hard-wired with a program that causes the meat to stay active and keep seeding more walking meat-balls.Yeah you were talking about something and just assuming they will actually perfectly mimic meat flavor and texture one day, which is not a given.

But even then I'd rather have a lab grown real meat burger than a plant based one even if they tasted the same. I try to keep soy to a minimum in my diet.Except for the environmental impact, which is huge.People were asking why I wanted to invest in cultured meat or doubting its impact.Everyone is free to their viewpoint, but I am excited to see this change to meat production change the face of the planet for largely the better.None of what you're saying really supports the idea of breeding billions of them every year for slaughter. I suppose the "industry feeds millions" is an argument for, but realistically, the same resources that produce chickens could be used much more efficiently to produce plants, and feed way more people.Most entitled westerners are more worried about the comfort of chickens and other animals than the starving poor people of color around the world, sad but true. First world problems.....Ya we need to eat and get all the proper nutrients. But many people haven't ate an animal for decades and they are thriving.All good points. And yes, vegans don’t care for fake meat products, especially not lab grown options. Those are being requested by, and developed for, meat eaters. 

I think it’s fair to say that the trend towards full vegetarianism isn’t all inclusive, isn’t constant, nor is it huge, but the idea of eating *less* meat has become very mainstream. I’d argue that the demand for higher quality meat has also gone up because people would rather splurge on the good stuff once in a while than eat Taco Bell every day. The biggest thing that will drive this will be the health angle and the climate/sustainability issue, with price a secondary factor.Why are you comparing fossil fuel to lab grown (NOT soy) meat? They have nothing to do with each other. And you want to compare a portfolio against a single stock? What? Nobody is saying that people’s vagu e interest in lab grown meat will somehow eclipse the need for petroleum based energy. That’s the silliest strawman I’ve heard in a while. 

It sounds like you’re just trolling for whatever reason. Enjoy your day.I can't really argue that. I think the label is all that is important to these companies bottom line. 

I'm just thinking if we had a specific site where we constantly were raising healthier livestock in a very ideal environment, we could then use that cell to reproduce the best meat possible at an incredibly low cost.gonna plead godwins law on this one bud, I'd say the comparison is ridiculous but I don't think you want answers you just want to be angry.i totally agree, companies participate in increasing their market share, but it's still a larger problem of societal demand. personally, I don't think we can ever trust a company to do anything but seek profit. it aught to be the governments job to fund more morally and environmentally ethical food, not the companies. meat is destroying ecosystems and accelerating carbon release, so why not incentivise more sustainable foods by taxing meats and using the money to give food aid to low income people.

my thesis is that yes, factory farming is bad, but companies will always do what's in their self interest. to facilitate the public good where the free market cannot, the government is responsible, not the board of Tyson.firms exist to make a profit, that is all they do. government regulation is required to make them ethical. I'm all for making firms more ethical, but it's naive to wish they did it themselves.

as a sidenote, factory farming produces less carbon and methane per lb of meat because of early slaughter and confined movement. it's inhumane to be sure, but I think the line between ethical and unethical is blurry especially considering we face a biodiversity collapse in a couple decades due to climate change caused in part by animal farming, factory or "ethical".I totally agree! I support incremental changes, but my thesis is that companies aren't responsible for being more ethical, people and governments are.Ribeye all day every day.A quick look at wikipedia shows that VHS actually had better technology where people cared (recording times and cost)

So, no the best technology does win.  Its just that the losing parties occasionally claim the opposite.Current cultured meat is not vegetarian. It is grown in fetal bovine serum as a growth medium, so it is effectively made of cows blood. Hopefully a plant based alternative is developed instead by the time it hits mass market.Not that that I 100% buy into the depth claimed. But it be a significant shift from agriculture for meat product to a manufacturing setting. This would have long tail disruptions from farmers, to butchers bday slaughter houses, transportation etc. If someone gets really good at it you could have regional “manufacturing/distribution” plants similar to Coca Cola and it’s distributed bottling infrastructure.Considering how much methane cows produce, and how much more harmful methane is than CO2 regarding climate change, if the production of cows decreases by a decent margin, it will also cause a decent in climate change. 

While I do think any non significant efforts towards slowing down climate change will save billions if not trillions in the future in damage, I do not think lab grown meat will be more significant than the internet. But I do feel it cause a uproar much higher than the internet among religious types.

The implications of lab grown meat I feel will contribute to lab grown organs for humans though (in terms of replacing failing organs), which will be huge.>How in the world do you think clean meat will potentially have a higher impact than the internet???

He obviously lacks logical skills.

He doesn't seem to get that the internet is a base technology where people can build things on top, while clean meat is a product itself.are you talking about the animals that are currently raised for meat?  They just won't be replaced. Cows don't occur naturally, they're forcibly bred. As demand drops for meat, fewer cows will be bredI mean no benefit over plant based meat substitutes, not no benefit over meat from animalsWhat you're missing here is that everyone knows cultured meat will take off when it finally hits critical production mass. You think I don't have money waiting to go into the next plant based meat company to go public? The only reason people aren't invested is because you simply can't outside of Beyond. Also if you think Beyond is overvalued you need to be looking at the rest of the market.Just go vegetarian.You’re absolutely correct and the person you’re responding to is an unscrupulous dimwit.Yes totally agree, in an ideal world, I would love to see fake meat completely replace low quality factory farmed meat and real meat would be more of a high quality luxury item. If red meat is produced on a small enough scale, you can produce it in a way that is carbon neutral or even carbon positive, but it's totally unrealistic at the rates people currently eat red meat. And low quality meat is honestly almost indistinguishable from the fake stuff, so who cares.

I really don't see fake meat ever replacing high quality farmed meat though. The hundreds if not thousands of years that have gone into agricultural knowledge as well and the terroir that allow certain regions to produce exceptional products seems like it would be impossible to recreate in a lab.My point is why would someone invest in some nonsense environmental stock like fake meat when returns for fossil fuels are essentially a guarantee for another 50+ years and they're all selling at a bargain now. Pick any fossil fuel stock in my portfolio and I'd bet it will outperform any fake meat stock.Oh no, do I need to break out the many many holocaust survivers that compare their own experiences to animal agriculture? Or can you use Google?I would argue they *are* culpable for lobbying for a regulatory landscape which allows them to operate unethically (i.e. making it illegal to share footage of a factory farm in operation).

So I think it is the corporation's fault, and it's also the fault of government corruption, and yes as you say to some extent it is the fault of individual consumers who choose to buy the products.

However I think it's also naive to expect individual consumers to "do the right thing" in the face of an industry which is spending billions of dollars on lobbying and advertising to make it cheap and convenient to eat lots of factory-farmed meat.

If factory farming were to end, I think it would have to happen through regulation brought on by popular outcry; it would not be reasonable to expect a purely market-driven solution based on the individual moral decisions of consumers to be effective.But why should the company, who is actually doing the unethical activity, be absolved from responsibility?Pangolin and shark fins.Ok so maybe that was a bad example.  The other ones still work.

Or here's another one.  Apple has consistently had worse tech than their competitors, but they're doing pretty well and growing due to good marketing and distribution.Yes. Not really a practical or ethical option at the moment for me, but the sooner it is, the better.They can 3D print real organs now.  If they are going to lab grow an organ it will probably be from your own stem cells to prevent rejection.But one can build toppings on top of the clean meat to build a burger.What a compelling argument. So much logical skills at display.Yeah but the cows currently alive would have to be shifted to some other industry, which is likely prohibitively expensive for a lot of small farmers. Corporate farms will probably just knock them to cut the cost of care.

So yeah they wouldn't be replaced, but that wasn't my question.The plant based subs don't taste as authentic as some want them toIf a solution exists to make the consumption not impact the environment, I don't see a reason to. I tried and the cost of willpower was more than I could handle. If I am the average then I don't expect most will succeed either. This seems to be the route to solve the problem on both the environmental and consumer side.No, I try to eat as little soy as possible, I'm not trying to have every single thing I eat contain it, it's already in nearly everything to begin with.Yeah, but don’t be so sure that “terroir” means anything. Even the wine world isn’t so sure of that anymore, and wine certainly reflects its landscape more than an animal eating grass does! Is there a particular locale/meat pairing that you think stands out? Usually it’s just “feed the animal high quality products” and sometimes “give them good fresh air”, which you could do in a lot of places. Like Wagyu beef is only special because there are very few cows in Japan, so they feed them super well.  It’s not the land that does it. 

But I’m with you on the lab probably never achieving the same result. One of the big hurdles is apparently that we can create lab grown muscle, but without the muscle being exercised, it doesn’t taste or feel like muscle. Maybe someday we’ll have little tiny treadmills.... loltell me that if Tyson stopped animal farms that another company wouldn't take over their market share. they are a result of the problem, not the cause.I realize this is a joke, but I do wonder during the next swineflu outbreak - with the lens of COVID - it would cause shifts in the overall pork markets as folks better understand the pork/pangolin/bat parallels.

Then again, maybe bacon is just too tasty to ever stop?None of them really work.

Part of having the best technology is correctly identifying customer needs and then using technology to fulfill that need.  The proper way to do things is to find a new technology and then try to fit it to customer needs.

In this case the new technology is understanding the importance of texture as far as food goes.  Lab grown meat does nothing for texture.  The only "advantage" it has is that it is using animal cells rather than plant cells.  And that is a disadvantage from a disease perspective.

Lab grown meat is more likely to be useful in medicine than food.source?? for 3D printing organsBut it's not like demand will just disappear overnight. It will ramp down, so the numbers will gradually decrease.If it got to that point the government would pay them to cull their herd, like a subsidy, and they wouldn't breed more.Meat eaters will not eat lab grown meat instead of meat. Vegetarians are the main market for lab grown meat. And they are already doing one of the biggest environmentally supportive things possible.In Italy, France, and most of Europe terroir is pretty well accepted. The fact that it is not well understood is why it would be hard to recreate. And its not just used in the context of wine but almost all agricultural products. A couple of examples for livestock would be Poulet Bresse, Charolais Cattle, etc. Anything that has an AOC really. It's really just the impact that a specific environment has on the things that are grown or raised there. Almost in the same way that the environment affects biodiversity.

To your point about muscles in lab grown meat. Very interesting! Although I do feel they could much more easily recreate muscle stimulation in a lab than terroir. I mean we already kind of do this to people in comas using electrical stimulation. To recreate terroir in a lab you would essential need to recreate all the conditions of an entire biome.You can't use google, got it. Have nice day.Forgot what article i was reading.   It said a company could print single cell thick vascular structures that's been tested to withstand blood pressure you'd see in the body.  Might not be at transplant stage but it's like very soon.I hope you are wrong. I'm hoping most meat eaters are still subject to economic conditions and thus if a cheaper comparable substitute is available they will buy it.I was a vegetarian for seven years in my 20s, been backing eating meat almost a decade again and I'll never go back to a vegetarian diet.

I would switch to lab grown meat in a heartbeat once it's in production

It was just this year the Slack CEO was laughing at Teams, and they sent Microsoft a joke card about being late to the party, but they're clearly worried now.All Microsoft has to do is point at their biggest competitor - Google - who provides a similar product as part of their own productivity suite.So its the browser wars all over again?

Something tells me Microsoft is smarter than whats claimed after 15 years in the doghouse last time such complaints came up.They spent the last few years changing their UI rather than developing an ecosystem and this is the result.

It's so easy to switch from Slack to Teams, Slack has absolutely zero stickiness. If they had calendar systems, presentation software, VoIP software, etc they would be much harder to switch from.

It's amazing they've managed to get so far selling a chat app given that chat has been free and bundled with various applications since the nineties. They've screwed up so bad their only chance is government intervention at this point.Nice. 

Even if the EU slaps them on the wrist with a 500 million dollar fine (insert headlines about largest corporate fine in the EU, EVER!!) MSFT will come out of this unscathed and with continued market dominance. 

So glad I increased my position in March.lol imagine being a glorified irc and laughing at teams and now being in shambles about being elbowed outSo Google duo and apple FaceTime having it natively on their operating systems means Jack to slack apparently. Microsoft's paralegal interns could win this case.I just want to cite Jeff Bezos here: ”(T)he No. 1 thing that has made us (i.e. Amazon) successful by far is obsessive compulsive focus on the customer as opposed to obsession over the competitor.“

Rather than focusing on Microsoft’s product slack should focus on their own, satisfying their existing clients and the news that it’s a good product will - when it really is a good one - spread automatically as it’s a product targeting the business world and not private consumers (which would make it rather necessary to advertise on tv e.g. and consumers habits change slower compared to business and the underlying softwares/technologies).This reeks of desperation.

Slack knows they are fucked. Teams is an inferior product, true, but it’s not bad and I really don’t miss slack all that much.They need to get acquired or join forces with another collaboration firm like Zoom. They’re too small.If you can’t beat em sue them. Truly the American wayDid not expect legal action but a large reason I sold my gains in $WORK was this subreddit. The general sentiment has always been it's good but Teams is an acceptable alternative that comes included. Was never going to be sustainable unless Slack was universally embraced like Zoom.4 P’s of Marketing. Price, Product, Promotion, Placement. Slack wins on product. Microsoft wins on everything else. Unfortunately product is not the only king in winning market share.Gotta love corporations going the litigation route rather than investing in improving their product.You know how Slack replaced IRC chat at my company? By supporting IRC. Once everyone was on board they pulled the plug. Embrace, Extend, Extinguish! The irony.Zoom, Slack, Snapchat.  All these tech companies with no moat are just waiting until tech giants determine it's profitable to reproduce their model.Tough look for Slack. Antitrust suits are never a good sign. I still believe Slack is starting to fill a different niche by integrating so many different software packages into their platform. I think this integration capability is what will set them up well in the future. This is how it is different than Teams. Short term it will look rough, but once Wall Street realizes this, then the stock price will jump quite a bit.Slack is desperate. I honestly never understood Slack even before Teams... In law I've always just used email and that was fine.Anecdote time...

Slack is superior to Teams when it comes to easy setting it up, the UX and UI, and how it interacts with third party services. But companies outside of tech do not care. I’ve tried to explain to my colleagues and accounting and ceo why Slack would make us more productive but the answer is “yeah, but teams comes with our Microsoft services and it does the same thing”. Only it doesn’t so the same thing, and nobody at the company uses it because it’s horrible. So now we don’t use Slack nor Teams. We email instead.Slack maybe better but Teams is included in the Office suite product line. If your workforce relies heavily on the Office products why waste money on a chat program when its already provided.Something ironic about US companies fighting legal battles overseasWorthless... analysis over.Microsoft is so stupid, don't block the uninstall> Slack threatens Microsoft’s hold on business email

That has to be a joke, right?Good, fuck Microsoft. Although realistically speaking, probably nothing will come out of this.I mean they kind of have a point, Slack is a much better product, by a mile, but everyone uses teams because it comes free with Office.Slacks video call quality is really bad. I do not understand why everyone praises them so much. Don't give me the UI argument. I prefer functionality over aesthetics.“We tried to copy you but couldn’t do it wahhh” - slackSlack is trash, a glorified chat room that looks like it was ripped off from the AOL chat room of the 90s[removed]\>   behavior that deprives customers of access to the tools and solutions they want  


How is packaging Microsoft Teams with office "deprivation" of any kind? Who said I want slack? I just want a job done! Whoever can get it to me at the cheapest price wins my money.Pretty good analysis of Slack vs Teams

[https://stratechery.com/2020/the-slack-social-network/](https://stratechery.com/2020/the-slack-social-network/)I guess I picked the wrong day to but $WORK callsCompetition complaints are always funny.

"They're making it so we can't compete!"  
"So they're outcompeting you?"Id like to see Google buy them.

Im a small business owner with like 20 desktops and we are all slack + gsuites and no Office at all. (Well....kinda)

I really like Slack but i fear they will lose the war if they dont diversify.This is sign of weakness and pain being felt by slack. $msft has the muscle and network within enterprise and way too strong competitor to fight against. Unless slack and amazn  has hidden agenda to go agains msft in the space(with amzn playing more than customer role),it will be really tough war to win for them ,especially the line of business the slack is in with thin moat.

I hope it doesnt end up being YELP and GOOGL fight.

Note-I'm neither long or short on this ,its just opinion as follower of the space.Seems like a legit argument. But also doesn’t inspire optimism in slack if they feel they need to do this.Enterprise software, where decisions are made by people who don’t use the product. It’s 2020, time to drop MS office including Teams.

MS need to have a game plan and stick to it. Every time they change directions, they get messy.Classic case of having no moat, and then getting eaten alive by the big players.

It's a freaking chat client Slack, shit isn't rocket science. Of course Microsoft is coming for a slice of that pie, and of course it's going to work seamlessly with their massive suite of enterprise products. 

That's why these kind of companies should always go for an acquisition over IPO.[deleted]I just came in here to ask this. Didn't the Slack CEO say last year that this was good for business?   


Oh how the turn tables.We use Teams at work. I have never used Slack so I can't critique. 

Teams is decent, but god damn does it feel like it's duct taping too many unrelated things together and missing the obvious shit. 

It's way too weird saving things to Team, or Sharepoint, or both, or neither. Or if I shared something to a calendar event but not the formal channel.  Good luck finding your shit and which version you actually meant to follow up editing. 

Why can't we also just do email and chat  in one fucking app? Aol was fucking 30 years ago and they managed to get that right the first time.If I was on that Microsoft Teams team, seeing Slack struggle would be one of my proudest accomplishments after they wrote that letter.My company switched to Teams like 3 months ago, it replaced Slack and 2 different video conferencing softwares we were using.  I immediately bought MSFT, because Teams really is nice, and it’s an easy sell to the Sys Admins/IT Dept because it replaces multiple apps with a single 1, not to mention MSFT already has a dominant position in enterprise-level software. 

My prediction is they’re either going to destroy Slack’s business, or attempt to buy Slack.> joke card

Was it a full two page spread in the New York Times or some other influential big name newspaper, or am I conflating this incident with something else?Well Teams is a better product so he should be worriedTeams is objectively, no-questions-asked, better than Slack, by a mile. Its integration into Office makes it unparalleled. Slack messed up.Which one? 

Google meet?And don't forget Zoom.  Teams is mostly an updated Skype (it started with the Skype kernel for goodness sake!) and the most used feature is the video calling.Google has no direct competition to slack/teams though?Except Microsoft was the underdog mere months ago when it came to market share and features. Slack even ridiculed them for how bad Teams was. They went from hubris to complaining fast instead of fighting it.It looks to be the exact same problem, just replace OS with Enterprise Contract. Our 3rd party supplier is actually setting up Teams for us for free, because of a MS incentive. Teams got bundled into a SKU we've already purchased, which means it's free. If anything this is worse than the OS bundling, because MS is also giving free professional services too.Disagree completely. Our IT department uses slack and the rest of the company uses Teams now. Slack is very easy to integrate with. My team alone (4 developers) has dozens of integrations in place. I’m not sure all of them are even possible in teams. We haven’t looked into it recently because we have hundreds of dev teams and switching just isn’t an option without a hefty cost.I think people are really underestimating Slack usage for non work related groups.  Its my friends go to and i know other friend groups that also use it.  Nothing else like it on the market for non work communication.  I am not going to be messaging my friends on microsoft teams and texting/whatsapp/facebook messanger aren't even close.The problem is.

What does Slack do next?

Businesses are not going to pick Slack when you can pickup a O365 E3 license for $12 more.

Slack has a niche and it does it's main function very well.  But if I'm looking at the features between O365 or Slack standard or Grid,  I'm picking O365 every day of the week because it's a matter of ROI, I would get better return on my investment with O365 a one stop shop.  I can't be a business on slack alone, I'm going to need a email system, Exchange Online, I'm going to need a productivity suite, poof word, excel etc.

It's difficult to justify slacks offerings if you already use Microsofts suite of products, and this is something slack isn't going to really overcome in the enterprise space.Honestly I like Teams better. What do you find is superior about Slack? I like that Teams has so many other things integrated like meetings and your calendar.I love teams but that is because I’m coming from having no company chat/info sharing platformI think it depends on what part you're saying is inferior. IMO Teams does a ton more in some areas. But yeah, Slack is well and truly fucked.Inferior?  How so. Chat. Presence. Voice. Conferencing. Pstn connectivity. Connections to SharePoint. OneDrive. Outlook. One note. If you are an MS shop it's a no brainierI don't think so. Slack has a European legal team, and they would be foolish not to use EU laws to their advantage. EU anti trust laws are actually pretty different than US anti trust laws. US anti trust laws are designed to help consumers, while EU anti trust laws are designed to help smaller businesses compete against larger businesses.Atlassian would be a better fit. But Slack's current valuation is insane.\*in the EU which is on a roll scrutinizing big tech[deleted]Everybody is a victim. Now corporations are jumping on the victim bandwagon.The product is good though, the issue is you have a much larger competitor forcing you out by giving it out for free to all their customers.

Its questionable whether this is good for users in the long term. Companies just being so huge they can compete in sectors without making money just to drive lock in to something else.

If Amazon decided to just run WFM like a Costco instead using Amazon prime subs they could sell at zero net profit and just run grocery stores out for example and I doubt that would be better for shoppers for more than a year or twoYeah. Never understood the hype behind Zoom. Still can't believe a video chat application is worth $76BDo you have examples of any of these integrations? Just curious what I’m missing out onSlack has integrations, but I’d be skeptical about how useful they are seen as. 

The flexibility is there, but the service design beyond that doesn’t seem to have a lot of depth. It results in an uninteresting user experience which leads people to think that the tools are little more than spam bots.

The ecosystem design hasn’t really matured in the way I expected. They refactored the platform, but with little effect for now. Most of the value in integrations still lives in the integrated application. In other words, the value can be integrated into other places.

If someone is able to create a really nice workflow with Slack by using integrations, it’s more of an upside to the integrated apps as compared to Slack itself. With the current setup, Slack can’t design a user experience that integrates the value of the workflow into the ecosystem.

For instance GitHub workflows integrates the value much better. The integration’s goal is to support automating common actions that are endemic to GitHub. They also work through an interface and configuration language which is GitHub specific al the while making the UX better, hence tying the integration process into GitHub itself.

This is not true for Slack. Currently it seems the only angle Slack has it the amount of integrations. I don’t see how much of a moat that creates though, because by tackling the few big productivity suites you cover a lot of ground. It’s not like ecosystem battling in the consumer side where every device gets the apps it wants—integrations usually follow some sort of pattern and vary less as a result. 

That may generally tie in with Slack’s culture. Looking at what they are doing, Slack seems to focus on incremental innovation. To create a better ecosystem they would likely need to think in a more holistic way. It seems like for now they are still preferring “how can we make this better”. When building an ecosystem you’d maybe benefit more from a balance seeking method where you are starting with a more top heavy outlook.I work with lawyers a lot and they frickin love the document collaboration and video conferencing features in Teams. They’re a goddamn nuisance now whereas before they’d struggle to find track changes. Which is good, I think?My org has 30,000 users. Adding paid slack is not a small cost. Teams does us fine, the few groups that really want slack can buy it out of their own budgets.Is Slack really superior than Teams with third party applications? 

And Teams's UX and UI is pretty good at this point.I think this is actually a key piece. For this very reason Slack is going to have a very hard time breaking into the non-startup world. At least in the near term. As boomers continue to retire, Slack could gain traction at larger established companies.Sounds like bad management then. My company’s management heard similar complaints and continued to pay for Slack since they recognize that 8 dollars a month per employee is well worth the productivity gains.Go start your own business using slack then.Almost as if a chat app isn't worth that muchIs the whole 365 suite not fair then? Would word by itself be fair? Exchange? Calendars? At what point adding a product to your business bundle becomes a problem?

Cause it doesn't come free, you have to buy office, it's like saying exchange is unfair cause it comes with 365 sub.Your submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

Slack does have the cool UI and all but I don't find it essential as such.Not a legit argument at all. 

Slack doesn't get to throw a hissy fit when competitors come to market. And of course Microsoft was going to integrate it into Office.I don’t think they have any legs to stand on. There are a lot of competitors in the market and Microsoft is allowed to provide a compelling product at a great price when they want to.It’s 2020, investors need to drop stocks in a chat app that that peaked in dev teams.

Teams is MS’ long game and it’s very successful.The partnership with Amazon hinted to me that an acquisition of Slack is probably coming.

Amazon’s is wayyyy behind in the space with a vastly inferior product, Slack is at least well designed and well liked by the dev community.I think it is more just worry about losing revenue.

Slack could grow 40x and only charge 2 dollars per person per year and they would have exactly the revenue they do now.

And they would still be charging more than teams.May be a typo, but in this context we would use the word "suite" of enterprise.

Sounds the same but different word.> shit isn't rocket science

Lync, Skype is a total shit show. It's amazing how badly chat is done when IRC is a superior product to many modern chat clients. Teams is an okay offering. MS is giving away professional services and bundling the product. Basically setting it up and giving it to their enterprise customers which is a hell of a deal.Yes. 
Tech savvy and modern smaller companies use slack. But lost others haven’t even heard of it. They have heard of excel and PowerPoint though. And share point. Many people have their whole career built on those tools. And they work seamlessly integrated into Teams.I actually think discord has an outside chance in this space (though it may end up getting acquired). As someone who has used hangouts, slack, mattermost, hipchat... discord is just flat-out better right now. it's better at everything it does. smoother, better ui, more stable, more features...> shit isn't rocket science

This is true, but it is surprising how hard the competition gets things wrong. I have been using teams recently, and it just feels so clunky in comparison.[removed]It’s also... not that great? Like it’s a web app and you can tell. On Mac I can’t even drag and drop image files into a chat I have to click the browse button like an absolute fucking caveman."Work seamlessly" is never something I thought I would see someone say when talking about teams. That app is a train wreck and its being forced on many IT departments because it's free. A free turd is still a turd.Its not really seamless though. Everyone I know likes Slack better, Teams is ....okay but the real problem for Slack is Teams is free and you wont compete with free because managers and VPs ain't gonna pay for shit just because the engineers like it.They bought Minecraft for $3B. And that's just ONE video game.The fall of Mixer most recently is an example.Yup, I feel the same way. Its half-assed UI design makes it nearly impossible to use.

Now I have to set my status on both Skype for Business and Teams independently, which is beyond stupid. My company now has 2 messaging apps, each with the same limitations (250 people per meeting max) for no reason. 

So many useless side tabs too. I can't understand who was dumb enough to make so many redundant tabs. 'Activity' - so I can see my past stuff? Isn't that already covered by 'Chats' and 'Calls'?

And 'Chats' and 'Calls' tabs, why aren't these combined, like they are in Skype? It makes no sense to separate them. I communicate based on the people I need to talk to, not the format. I need contacts, which is how Skype is organized.

Only the tech teams at my company have Slack and its closer to a Discord chat room, moves quickly, autocorrects, fluid UI etc.

Anyways, Teams is a terrible product, but it'll win anyway.Uh, if Teams is configured properly, it’s simply a different front end for Sharepoint. Save it via Sharepoint or save it via Teams. It goes to the same place.Reminded me of “Welcome IBM, Seriously” ad from Apple in 1981 in the WSJ.Teams has more features, but its core messaging/chat is way behind Slack.And chat. Google Chat.

I know people hate it, but it's not half bad for it's price. Especially if you're a team that doesn't have a lot of use for office products - like an early stage tech startup.My coworker used to call it Google MeatSkype for Business is a rebrand of Microsoft Lync which was introduced in Office 2010. Although the application name changed to "Skype for Business" in 2015, the Windows process name is still Lync.exe. Lync was the successor to Office Communicator 2007, which no one used.It's not called a kernel, source code or engine is the standard term.https://gsuite.google.com/products/chat/Is it really free if it's bundled in Office 360 subscription ?The people who like Slack (myself included) *really* like it and see the value in it, even more so with its integrations.

But for various client-facing account reps or sales, my guess is that they need something that a lot of people are on. I'm on both Teams and Slack because my dev team is on Slack and everyone else is on Teams.

At the end of the day, some people just need a thing to IM people.It's the same with us. The dev integrations were literally the only sticking points. I wasn't involved in the migration so I can't comment on the difficulty, but I know it didn't take long.

It wasn't a welcome change, but like most corporations we already have an Office 365 subscription so given the relatively pain free move to teams it just made sense.

That said, I'm sure a lot of startups and dev teams will keep Slack for the integrations.A lot of people here are comparing slack and teams to the things that slack does, rather than realizing that teams targets a significantly broader group of people.

There are 2 main things teams provides that slack is inferior at.

1. Teams has all kinds of calling options that make it superior not just for internal conferencing, but can be integrated very nicely with call centers and others that do a lot of external calling. Slack requires a different service to do either effectively.

2. The integrations in slack are mostly limited to command line type integrations. While these are significantly more advanced than old CLI stuff from the 80s and 90s, the teams GUI integrations is a strong desire for non-technical people.

All of that being said, I think slack is a superior chat product, but there's more to teams than chat.Slack is only used by tech savvy people in most companies. 

It’s a usability nightmare. How do you build a collaboration tool that intimidates non-techies from collaborating?Give it a year or two maybe. Soon enough Teams will include those too.Not sure how it will compare with Integrations, but Microsoft may try to compete with that with their [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/) platformSlack sees a lot of hate in this sub. I'm guessing it mostly comes from people who 

1. Aren't developers
2. Heavily use the Microsoft ecosystem

As a SWE I can tell you every company I've worked at would see a mutiny if they tried to switch devs from Slack to Teams. So there is quite a bit of stickiness for certain types of users. If they'll be able to continue to grow and take market share away from MSFT I don't know. But Slack isn't going to disappear.> for an acquisition over IPO.

For non-work related groups, Discord is where it is at :)Non work communication? Like Discord?Discord?Maybe slack should have thought about what they would do next when they built a business model on a chat client.  

If they thought it added value they should have built a moat, but suing because Microsoft bundles business chat is silly since it’s hardly revolutionary.  Microsoft own’s lync, and then Skype for business, has been part of office since 2012 (maybe earlier) and predates the existence of slack.The UX and ability to integrate your own automation, mainly.

But yeah they are mostly equivalent. It had no impact on my work whatsoever. They are afterall only chat clients and we have had those all the way back to IRC. How Slack got a marketcap of 18b with that as their only product still baffles meUX mostly. 
 
Teams is a good product. I like it as I have mentioned before and can use either without complaintAtlassian would just turn Slack into an unmantained and slow blue-themed mess. Oh, don't forget the terrible search and Australian government snooping.Yeah Slack and Trello seem very complimentary.*and because they know they'll get laughed out of court in the USYou could argue that with the o365 integrationGithub, AWS, CI/CD pipeline notifications, Jira work-item creation, Pager-Duty, and a bunch of other stuff my manager has added in lol. (I prefer Teams. I don't need all this extra stuff and I prefer simplicity.)This is a very important point.  Slack is a fine business group purchase (just like Yammer used to be, remember that shit?), but once it goes mainstream IT, these little dogs can't provide the tools and piece of mind (security!) Microsoft provides to every single corporate IT department.Yes the cost of Slack is not insignificant especially for enterprise organizations. Startup with <500 employees? Sure why not. Enterprise with 5000+ employees? Slack becomes a significant part of the budget.

It's also easy to cut away if it's a Microsoft/Office 365 organization and Teams is already included.

One of my friends said that her company didn't go with Slack because the cost would be around $500k/year.What ends up happening is enough teams do that that it becomes a not insignificant cost and they end up getting it for everyone...And this is the reason why I feel slack will fail.Honestly, I haven’t tried Teams for a few months now. Perhaps it has gotten better. I found implementation of bots, adding “webhooks”, and using third party services with Slack was seamless. With Teams it was a mess. But I guess not everyone agree.Right because only young people understand the value of Slack?How is slack more productive? I've used both at different companies and they seem interchangeable to me. Slack does a better job at searching for stuff I guess.Ok. Any ideas on what kind of business I should start?Maybe but they've taken the approach of do one thing, and do it well. 

It's very easy to use while also being feature rich, and has plug-in support to add anything you like. I personally wouldn't use anything else.I don't see any Channels in Google Chat.It was already integrated.  Lync upgraded into Skype for business which upgraded into teams.  At our company it’s basically always been Microsoft’s chat client for work and I just noticed it got a lot more stable with the teams client. 

If that’s anti-competitive they needed to sue back in 2010 or whenever lync got included, not in 2020.Wow, what a thoughtful analysis of their complaint 🤦‍♂️It's an anti-bundling argument. You aren't allowed to exploit a dominant position in one area and use it to get a leg up in another one.

It's why European copies of Windows ask you what browser you want to install.The market will decideThis would be fascinating and give Slack a major edge. Would definitely support this because we need competition and Amazon has the $$$$ to do it.

Aside from Amazon, it would be interesting of someone like Salesforce buying it.Google or Salesforce or Atlassian or Zoom would be good matchesI think Google would be another good acquirer. G Suites + Slacks sounds more on par against Office + Teams.ok, perhaps i just need more caffeine. 

but I've read this comment over again 3 times and I'm confused by it...

do you mean that they have no revenue?
do you mean that charging $2 per person is 40x less than what they currently charge?

i just dont understand how Slack's revenue would be exactly the same if they grew 40x and charged $2 ?Dawg you ever used Excel? That shit is sweet afI think Discord would pair nicely with twitch.

Heavily use the Microsoft ecosystem

So 97% of the population?I've been a software engineer for over 20 years and have used every chat app or video calling app in existence since the 90s.

Slack was meh at best.  Teams is great.  We got rid of shitty zoom as well.  We have our build systems posting alerts to teams rooms, and have eve played with bots to automate dev ops through teams.  We've barely scratched the surface of teams integration possibilities.A company really shouldn't rely on the love of devs though. And before you think this is just Slack hate, understand that I love Slack and use it personally every day - but I use Teams as well.

Devs love Slack for its integrations and other reasons I'm sure. But for account reps, sales, marketing, and so many other people in the organization who just need an instant messenger, they have no reason to be loyal to Slack or Teams.

I own $WORK and I hope it continues to grow, but its growth alone should not be fueled by "devs love Slack". Its gotta appeal to broader audiences if it's going to truly rival and compete with Teams which gets slapped on everyone's desktop (provided the company is in the Microsoft ecosystem).The app only video game people use?The app only video game people use?

Slack has far more reach with the amount of people that already are familiar with it at work.  I have never heard anyone mention Discord outside of Reddit and twitch.They do have an api, but the preference is to integrate it with cloud services rather than ok-prem. This suits many companies who prefer using SaaS over in-house bespoke tools.Teams actually has a lot of room for automation too. I'm sure not how it compares to Slack though, but it does seem they want to be competitive there too.Because US courts don't give a fuck about anti-competetive practices...Yeah, so dev world collab.  There is a whole other (much, much bigger) world of non devs (and people that don't work in Silicon Valley) that need/prefer/thirst for the Slack-like experience, but working with Office.

Enter Skype/Teams.

Edit:  To your point I think (different niche).I imagine all that is coming to Teams anyway though. MSFT owns GitHub and have been growing a large portion of their developer tools and cloud integration stuff, so it should be a logical step for them.GitHub integration sucks. There's no way to mute the corresponding channel it creates. So I get dozens of unnecessary notifications all day long.Slack is already an enterprise tool being used by enterprises and supported (preferred, even) by their IT departments.>One of my friends said that her company didn't go with Slack because the cost would be around $500k/year.

Isn't it $5/user? Does her company have 100k employees?Teams has been on fire since the pandemic. It seems like every time I complain about a missing feature, the next update adds that feature. It's still not perfect, but has come a long way even in the last six months.Heaps of changes and fixes in the past six months. In many cases it’s been the saving grace for WFHMostly for features Slack has that Teams doesn’t beyond just messaging. This sub has a hard on against Slack so I’ll always be downvoted for supporting the stock but this sub has been hilariously wrong on many stocks.This is why you’ll always just be a worker complaining to the accountant and ceoI guess, but there's a difference between "anti competitive" and "can't compete because of our business model". It's way too expensive for what it isI never found that to be essential.> If that’s anti-competitive they needed to sue back in 2010 or whenever lync got included, not in 2020.

That's not really a thing -- in the Internet Explorer case they didn't need to be sued back in 1995 when IE first came out. They got sued somewhere around version 5 when it was abusing a dominant position to eliminate competition.About as thoughtful as 'seems legit'.But they have to prove the bundling was to “kill the competition”.  In this case it would be hard to prove since Microsoft have included a chat application in office from the beginning, with lync to Skype for business to teams.  If slack was fine with Skype for business but somehow loses to teams, what exactly is the cutoff?  Is Microsoft not allowed to improve their products?Remindme! 1 yearHow does Amazon acquiring them give Slack "a major edge?"

 Microsoft is the #1 enterprise software in the world. They have the edge as they are already tied into so many organizations.I would love if salesforce bought slack.This is what I wants. But google seems set on building their own thing. $TEAM is another commonly named suitor for them.Google's released their own "Chat" application that seems to be in the same space.  If they acquired Slack, it would be for the user base, and they would kill the app in a month.I know it’s all about preference but 365 shits on g-suite IMOI'm basically saying there is a limited market for 8 dollars per person per month, but a much larger market for a cheaper product.I need coffee too my man. Growing 40x and charging $2 is going to be way more increased revenue. No one can convince me that the cost of the growth would outweigh the revenue for a thing like Slack.Some would call it "the sheet".Your submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

You can work in C# but that doesn't mean using Teams over Slack will be any easier for you. It's the office place tooling that's integrated. If you use Microsoft Word and Outlook then using Teams might be easier for you. 

> So 97% of the population?

I don't know what you're basing that on.Cool everyone's entitled to their opinion. I love Slack. Teams is meh. We do very similar things in Slack.I think you’re totally right. That’s actually one of the reasons I don’t own WORK. I’m not sure if it will grow past it’s core audience. This sub gets a little weird with Slack. Discussions usually go beyond evaluating whether or not the stock is a good buy to being derisive of the product itself. I’m more just making a case for the integrity and usefulness of the product. I think people are right to be skeptical of the stock.well I don't know about that, but my group doesn't only use it for video games, we use it to chit chat as well and we have different channels for other interests like audio and food.

We used slack in it's early days for a good number of years before switching to discord as back then, slack didn't have voice channels integrated in it but discord did.Kinda like Facebook...you know...that site only college kids use, right?Slack? The app people only use for work?GroupMe is vastly more popular than Slack for non-work communication. There’s no comparison. Not to dis your comment, but Slack doesn’t have a moat.Whats anticompetitive? Slack is suing because Microsoft is competing with themPossible San Francisco/engineering bias within the org. I suppose engineers would prefer to work and have more awareness of features that benefit them.Integration with GitHub was done last year and Azure Devops has been done for a while too. Not sure how it compares to slack integrations though.Exactly my point though. All these integrations are useless to me. I don't need that shit in my chat app.$6.67 per user per month, billed annually ($80/yr). So $500k/yr is 6,250 users.It would be nice for you to specifically mention those features. You’ve mentioned it’s better, etc. I’ve used both and noticed minimal differences, so I’m legitimately curious what I’m missing. 

Also, as a separate note, MS is a fast follower, and I wouldn’t expect many features to remain exclusive to slack for very long.IME, if you have a solid reason for believing in the stock, then sentiment from random investors being against it is a good sign, long term.  Knowing something the market doesn't is how you make money picking stocks.I didn’t even know there was an anti Slack sentiment here, so I got all confused when I saw the downvote last to both your and my answers. I had to read them again to make sure there wasn’t anything controversial in there, and couldn’t find anything that could come across as rude.It is with more people working together.  It replaces mass emails to coworkers on a topic.

Channels arw a must to keep tracks of a discussion ongoing for weeks.That is the crux of the case. Slack's position is:

> The complaint details Microsoft’s illegal and anti-competitive practice of abusing its market dominance to extinguish competition in breach of European Union competition law. Microsoft has illegally tied its Teams product into its market-dominant Office productivity suite, force installing it for millions, blocking its removal, and hiding the true cost to enterprise customers.Ha 😁!

|-|-|-|-|I know my company uses slack, also uses Amazon servers, Amazon VoIP, Amazon file shares, etc...

Integrating them would work quite nicely tbh...Google and killing off their own chat apps, name a more iconic duo8x12/40>2I spread sheet around the office all day, and sometimes I spreadsheet around my home.Surface line up seems successful in recent years.but that's exactly what they did in the lawsuit they lost in the EU. The OS was a paid for product back then, it was just sometimes bundled with the PC purchase, but you bet your ass Dell and HP are paying.Targeting statements followed by force bundling the competing product into an existing suite. 

My guess: Europe sides with Slack; US sides with Microsoft.Oh, it's per month, holy crap!Fair. Slack is also a resource hog, unsure how teams relates in that regard. Slack has features developers use. It has easy bot integration, supports plug ins with other applications, etc. We use slack to send alerts to people who are responsible for keep systems online and fully functional from Splunk and other software and my understanding is that Teams doesn’t support any of that well. Plus the UX is far better than Teams in general.Those are components of a product, not a product themselves. Slack doesn't tie into them in the same way that Teams interacts with the products in Office 365.Google and [killing off any neat and useful service](https://killedbygoogle.com/)Okay that make sense, but I'm still skeptical. The OS was in litteraly every computers you could buy beside thé Apple ones. Here the consumer has to willfully select the Microsoft software suit to get Teams, it's not pushed down your throat like IE used to be.

Anyway, I will follow this topic closely and see how cards are being played out, it's exciting !I see. Thanks! 

Yeah, I didn’t notice a massive difference in UX, but I went from teams-> slack so I might not have appreciated it as much if I went in the opposite direction.For me, you need to look at cost benefit of both products:

\-Slack is also a resource hog,-  but teams is not (as much)

\-Slack has features developers use. - so does teams, (perhaps different features?)

\-It has easy bot integration, - as does teams

\-Supports plug ins with other applications, - as does teams.

though I think what you meant was, other people have made slack more useful by making their product integrate with it. - the trouble is they are doing that for teams to (more and more) so that benefit is being eroded.

\-We use slack to send alerts ... Splunk. - splunk also integrates to send alerts to teams channels.

\-the UX is far better than Teams in general. - I find it the other way around! but each to their own...

&#x200B;

The real problem is cost, I can pay $8 per month per person for slack, which gets me text message functions.

Or I can pay $8 per user per month and get email, Calendars, yammer sharepoint, One drive, (with 1TB storage, Delve, staff hub planner, Stream, the online web versions of the office apps, (word excel etc, web versions, including the online document collaboration stuff.) AND text based messaging functions and free internal voice calling (using Teams calls)

&#x200B;

I can pay a few dollars more and I get all those office apps to install on my devices (desktop versions rather than just web apps.) 

I can also get external VOIP breakout from Microsoft, national or international dial plans etc. (at more extra cost.)

&#x200B;

The trouble with slack is, it is only slack. 

I can go to Microsoft and get everything I need to run a business (practically the same day, hosted, with guaranteed 99.9% uptime.)

Maybe I hate Microsoft, then I can use google docs, and google chat etc, all nice and neat together...

or I can go to Slack and get a single application that deals only with text instant messaging.

&#x200B;

someone hit the nail on the head above when they pointed out that for large companies (I also work in a large enterprise company of around 6 - 7 thousand people) supporting slack because a couple of developers "like the UX" is a half million dollar per year cost. (no large company is loosing that kind of money for not having slack.)

This thread characterized that sort of decision (not just letting developers have their slack shaped toy,) as bad management (I imagine that's why it's down voted.)Yeah... but Teams has seamless Jira integration...I know slack doesn't tie into them, but it would be awesome if it did. Imagine being able to call people through slack with Amazon VoIP.Yes. The group is smaller this time. I have no idea what MS' corporate penetration is, but it's gotta be real high.I’ve heard this argument over and over, and I disagree with it. I’m not a developer myself, I just work with them and listen to what they tell me. 500k for thousands of employees to eek out 1% more production is well worth it.

This came across more hostile than I intended, but I’ve just heard most of the general arguments before aside from the specific integration examples you gave. I’ve been told by very smart people that Teams would restrict our functionality too much. My wife and several friends were in organizations that went from Slack to teams and two of them, including my wife’s last job, went back to Slack due to employee complaints.In teams, I can be messaging a couple people in a group thread, start a video call directly from that chat thread, record that video session such that it is automatically available via the YouTube like stream component of office 365 with permission default set to the people on the thread, add a PowerPoint file to that thread, and then collaboratively edit that file in my desktop client with other people on the chat.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*My working theory is that CNBC brings this guy on just so that they can generate the type of headlines that have significantly higher click rates when shared on Facebook/Twitter.

He's wealthy because of his early stake in FB, but Social Capital as an entity has not been particularly successful and is effectively an MFO now.  You wouldn't normally have someone like that on to offer commentary, unless you just wanted to run headlines about a VC manager saying these sorts of things that make for fantastic shares on social media.I like how no competition is factored into Tesla's price or outlook. It's as if the entire world auto and energy markets are just going to roll over and die without a fight and give 100% of the markets to Tesla. I guess that's why we only have one car company now. And one energy provider. Because everyone wants the same thing and business folk don't like to compete for profit.But it's not even close to the industry leaders in those categories. I'm fine with people buying tesla, but c'mon trillions of dollars? no. Tesla has a LOT of catching up to do on it's solar panels, hasn't touched other renewables. I will say, it's battery business is probably it's best most useful portion of it's portfolio and that is absolutely not a "renewable" even if it is green.in 2017 he said bitcoin could be worth 100k in 3-4 years, likes commenting on hype trains. [cnbc link](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/12/social-capitals-palihapitiya-says-bitcoin-is-going-to-1-million-in-the-next-20-years.html)The guy is really a mixed bag. I would say that he is trying to portray himself as a white hat billionaire, but he is in over his head quite often.

- Made a lot of money... through Facebook, which he is now dissing all the time, along with Big Tech. Very convenient.

- Went on CNBC and made headlines about the Fed screwing the average American. Goes back and praises Elon-zi potential as if he was Cathie Wood

- Helped launch SPCE... which is all hype at the moment and is another 'bubble' stock

- Social Capital, as others have pointed out, seems another smoke and mirrors operation... with very hefty ambitions though. 

In his shareholders' letter he compares it to Berkshire's returns, which is revealing of his approach (own it till I die), but ultimately ridiculous and indicative of a magalomaniacHe's a hype man, he said bitcoin was going to $1 Mil per coin in 2017.  He's full of shit.  That said, solar companies aside from Tesla are way undervalued imo.It had better have a chance of being worth trillions if it's a $300B company earning <$1B per year. Obviously not a value stock, so it's a growth stock. So the market thinks it can be worth trillions.I understand all the Tesla sceptics and respect all the differing opinions. Does anyone actually want to see them fail though? If they deliver on the things they promise this is good for every man, woman and child no?What about SPCE thoeCars are one thing.

Renewable energy components are quite another. They're essentially commodities and extremely hard to differentiate and charge premium margins for.

This guy has really lost it.Tesla : Cars :: Amazon : BooksA hedge? Are you serious? With these valuations it's more of a lottery ticket.Yeah because Tesla is the only one making batteries or investing in renewable energy /sOk now I think this guy is just a sensationalist. It’s easy to say shit and do nothing when your already super rich.[deleted]This face literally looks like a pumper or someone everyone picked on in high school or bothThat's pretty much the reason CNBC brings half of their guests on and most of their TSLA commentators.  Kathy Wood is another big one where she'll just pull some ridiculous valuation out of her ass based off a 'model' a first year college student would be embarrassed to submit.  But hey it gets clicks and people to look into ARK's funds which makes both parties happy.

I'm pretty sure it's the same with all the perma bears and anti-Fed commentators who have never really been right about anything but will still stir up some spicy financial apocalypse commentary and general fear porn.He's often quite hyperbolic about things he is interested in (social justice investing).Social Capital has been immensely successful. Here is their annual letter. 3x the S&P 500 (including dividends) over the past 8 years (since inception).

https://www.socialcapital.com/annual-letters/2019Well he said SPCE and WORK is gonna be worth trillions. Therefore he is my maaaan.I mean everything MSM does is to generate views and clicks. You don't need a theory for that.When it comes to stories like this, the first question people should ask themselves is what is the financial interest to the company running the headline, to the reporter writing the article, and to experts being interviewed.

CNBC and other big media companies are just that, *media* companies. Their primary business is news and they make money from headlines and clicks, not by being correct about the stock market or a particular company's future or valuation.Wait until you find out how much he's down in private poker game.The hate for Tesla is so strong we’re now shitting on a self made billionaire because he understands the company’s value. Never change r/investingI also love the people now saying "Tesla is just like Amazon in the dotcom bubble, they dropped 90% when it popped but if you held you'd have made a killing."

No mention of the 10 companies for every 1 Amazon that never got anywhere near their 2000 valuation again. How do they know Tesla isn't Yahoo!?

I think Tesla is a viable company, but I don't see how they are "likely" to ever live up to their current valuation with financial performance. There is definitely a market for their cars, but it is not mass market yet, and by the time it is they will be competing with Honda, Toyota, Kia, GM, Ford etc. at the mass market level.Yeah, people loved to talk about the Model S outselling the competition and make fun of the  Porsche Taycan, but in recent months you hear pretty much nothing on that front.ThE cOmPeTiTiOn iS cOmiNg

-you since 2015 probablyDid you know that Ford is also a fossil fuel company?!It’s battery business is largely the thermal regulation of batteries made by Panasonic.Still has a few months to go 10x, seems realistic /sChamath recommended Bitcoin back in 2013 as well, probably before you considered it a "hype train"He also told ppl to put 1% of their net worth it in back in 2013 when it was $200/coin

He also made a bull case for Tesla on cnbc last year (against the trend) when it was $250.If Bitcoin continues its previous price trajectory, there's a real chance that happens in 2021He had $5M worth of BTC when the price was $200: https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/29/chamath-palihapitiya-owns-5-million-in-bitcoins-wants-to-own-10-15-million/

BTC up 50x since he publicly recommended it. He's not just jumping on hype trains.That’s kind of an obvious prediction based on historical prices, bitcoin tends to shoot up and start rising a year or so after each halving event, that occurs every 4 years. We just had one such event in May this year. But yes, it is natural for people to be wary every time this happens, there’s no way we can be certain that it will happen again.Any specific companies you like? (In ENPH and ICLN)As someone else in this sub so eloquently put it, would you pay $300,000 for a business that generates $100 per quarter?Being right is more important than progress for a lot of peopleNot a huge fan of Tesla, but I'm not rooting for them to fail.  However, I wouldn't mind the following happening.

1.  Stock comes back to more realistic levels.

2.  The overall hype and outsized media coverage gets dialed back a bit.

3.  The SEC actually starts throwing the book at Musk for stock manipulation whenever he starts with his bullshit on Twitter.I really do want to see Tesla be successful as a company, and more generally to see EVs become successful as an industry because I want what I think is best for the world. 

However, I'm also not touching that stock with a ten foot pole until it comes back down to earth, or at the very least back into the right solar system.Who wouldnt want to see a green future and utopia on earth. But that doesnt mean we shouldnt be realistic. If i were you i wouldnt bet on tesla fulfilling all your green dreams given their track record on upholding promises. Anyone can say theyre going to make the world a magical place but it doesnt mean theyre actually going to do it.This comment will age well.Trivago : Hotelso sad they took out analogies in the SATs...You're joking right? In 2019, nearly 85% of Tesla's revenue was from car sales and leases. It's a car company.It took until almost 2015 before they stopped regularly bringing Schiff on to let us know that the dollar was collapsing within the next few months.i dunno, woods has been very at spotting good picks.

her valuations are typically modelled and have various price points on set variables.

to disagree with woods is to contest her math, but its all backed by something at least.Ok but both of them were extremely bullish on tesla when few were.  They deserve some credit for that, no?[deleted]Her fund is up >50% annually. So I tend to listen when she talks. I bought nvta after she talked it up few months ago on BloombergIt makes for good headlines and lots of clicks, that’s why CNBC interviews him often.Valuation games in VC allow this sort of thing, you’d need to ask why they bled investors and wound down two years ago if this were the case?I would think all media is about that not just MSM. 
They're all corporations.I think something I really want people here to get is media companies report real news, and they also create content that drives traffic.  One should immediately ask “is this post going to be the one they share on their Facebook page”.  And if the answer is yes then it’s probably safe to disregard. Lately the top posts on this sub have been the same ones I’d expect to make the rounds on social media - ie not useful news.He's a smart guy for sure, but he's also a bullshitter who likes to say provocative things. He got lucky and made his fortune with Facebook. He understands the power of narrative so he creates hype around the companies he's interested in. Doesn't really mean he is great at valuation.The competition has been here for a while. Not much in the USA but in Europe and China there's a sizable market of electric cars that sell well.If we listed all the shit Elon said Tesla was going to do but hasn't we'd break reddit.Panasonic is the company that everyone thinks Tesla is honestly. They make the best quality widely available solar panels on earth.He tends to aggrandize the topic du jour on cnbc. I think his thoughts on less developed trends are more interesting.I think it depends on what circles were in. For the average person or even the average investor Bitcoin might not have really been on the radar, at least not as something serious.

However, if you were in tech and kept up with new technologies and trends, and especially if you were in the right sector(s) or also involved in finance it would have very much been on your radar and was already building its own hype. I do agree with you that he was on it earlier than most mainstream folks, but he also wasn't just pulling some unknown thing out of the mud. It was new and exciting and already generating plenty of interest on its own. 

Also, somewhat in his defense, I think that we need to recognize that he wasn't advocating people sell their houses and put their 401(k)s in bitcoin, he was advising people to put a tiny fraction of their portfolio in it. If I had put just 0.5% of my portfolio in bitcoin when he had suggested it, I'd have made a hundred grand just by selling it 12-13kish.Previous trajectory?  It's current trajectory is... flat for the past 12 months...SPWR, CSIQ and FSLR.  I like ENPH and SEDG but theyve been a bit over-hyped and might be in for a drop.  All have relatively small market caps.id buy calls on it\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^-right here. Give me that money. They will comeback. I truly believe they are the future , not now, a correction would be nice. For me that is. This is "investing" we are supposed to make broad predictions that could come true, or not. The subreddit should be called "We'll See."  instead.That makes me lolAsk musk if it's a car company.You know he is gonna be making the rotations again. I saw his thumbnail on Rogan this week and just started wincing at his mugshot. And believe me, I am pretty deep into gold right now, but I can see his scare tactics a mile away.I'm sure she puts more effort into the ETFs than she lets on publicly, but her valuation models for stuff like Tesla based on some scenario, the ones they publish are super simple and flawed.  What they actually think internally is anyone's guess, but the crap they use to grab airtime is ridiculous.[deleted]Chamath went through a tough period for a couple of years - he explained this on Recode’s podcast.

While hyperbole, he’s not wrong about Tesla’s future revenue streams being beyond cars. The runway they have in this space is obscene. Yes competition is catching up but they are years away from the network that Tesla has and the software. Cars vs modern day mobile data machines on wheels.

He’s also said Tesla was a trillion dollar company for years now.Who says they bled investors? Genuinely asking if you have some credible sources.He got lucky by immigrating from a third world country and working his way into an executive role at Facebook where he led their growth to exponential levels. Got it. But you people on reddit are the real geniuses.If we listed all of the idiotic bear arguments and billions lost shorting the company we’d break the internetI didn't know Panasonic made solar panels.It is worth noting, nonetheless, that although Bitcoin can certainly be described as a hype train, Chamath was less jumping on the train than shoveling coal to get it startedYeah but if it goes up again it will like, go up.If Canadian Solar expands its partnership with Amazon to the US market.. that would be quite something. I personally have 100 shares just sitting in the back for CSIQ. If it starts popping off though, I'll probably go all in there.do it, I dare you. Or are you too afraid to put your money where your mouth is?That's the beauty of earnings reports for public companies. They can say it's a dingleberry factory, but if >75% of revenue comes from cars i think I can figure it out myself.I'm sorta new to this but he seems to just criticize things, doesn't use scare tactics imo.[deleted]That's not where the returns come from, in VC you run rounds of funding and effectively set the valuation yourself so unless you're actually realizing returns from bringing entities to market or facilitating sales to other PE firms then your actual gains are kinda whatever you want them to be.  While I don't think social capital is as bad as Softbank this is why Softbank was beating the shit out of the S&P on their annual reports all while it's bleeding cash.

Again, one must ask the question if they were so successful why did they wind down the fund in 2018 and turn it in to a glorified MFO?  That's not something successful funds do.  So like he can put whatever he'd like in the annual reports that really only matter for the three families in the entity, but it's really hard to call a fund that literally failed and wound itself in to a MFO two years ago "wildly successful".TSLA may or may not be a trillion dollar company.  I don't have a strong opinion there because so much is built on unknowns.  The criticism here is CNBC's blatant attempts at getting clicks by giving this guy interviews because of the things he says.Dude the fund wound down two years ago.  Like it was all over the news.  This is just Chalmath making reports on his MFO operations that he retained under the same entity.

Like it was all over the news.  here's 8 seconds of googling:

like not to be snarky but this sort of stuff comes up all over the place if you just google the name before jumping to questioning people.I never said he didn't work hard or take risks. He was just lucky he got asked to join Facebook which turned out to be huge - that's how he earned his fortune and that doesn't make him some kind of investing genius. Yet he goes around hyping companies saying they will be the next big things worth astronomical amounts of value.Just understand every time one of the lemmings buys someone else is cashing out.Yeah. Its replacing gold because crypto... nevermindIt was sarcasm you imbecileSo since McDonald's makes most of their money on fries are we calling it a fry company now? Since Microsoft makes most of its money from cloud services is it just a cloud company?Maybe I am biased, but I watched him during the 2008 crisis all over the place talking about how gold is the only answer and the us dollar is going to be debased and the only way forward is tying the dollar to gold. Along with Ron Paul, Schiff was so far up Reddit's butt that even Digg users felt it.

You know what he sold? Gold.The worst ones are older stuff that were updated and full of a lot of magic numbers.  Their newer ones are a bit better but still have very few inputs and a lot of pretty generous assumptions.  They've got a github page with their newest ones here: https://github.com/ARKInvest[deleted]This is why he closed his fund. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vErPgQF3N38 

As a startup guy I agree.Fair; but it’s CNBC.. it’s their job to sensationalize everything to drive clicks.

Chamath is articulate, yet animated guy - perfect media fodder. Im sure they’d just as well have Elon smoking pot on the show if they could.CNBC has been criticized from both ends for who they invite onto their show. Gordon Johnson has been ridiculed by TSLA bulls for constantly being proven wrong and losing a ton of money on TSLA, but CNBC keeps inviting him on.

CNBC is hardly the only news organization to get criticized for who they invite on. Inaccurate but entertaining guests get invited on much more often then accurate but boring guests.[deleted][deleted]Btw all the articles talk about problems with personnel/people leaving, nothing at all about poor returns.

So basically classic journalist BS.Lol so you have no numbers or evidence, just axios.com. 

I gave you actual numbers from them proving their outperformance. And you send axios.com. Joke.He and the other early executives made Facebook what it is, and that is anything but luck. People, him included, built that business. He was compensated for that, not winning an interview lottery and keeping a seat warm while the business grew around him.Here’s the thing about investing. The goal is returns. We can measure those with exact numbers. I’m up 300% on TSLA and cashed out enough to make the down payment on my house and then some. How are you doing?If McDonald's made close to 90% of its money on fries- yes. If msft made 90% of its money on the cloud- yesFair enough, I was only 13/14 around then so didnt really know anything about the markets or economics back thenIn general, you probably shouldn't be holding positions that you need to be asking anonymous internet commenters about buying/selling. It's needlessly risky to invest in things that you don't fully understand.You shouldn’t ask people on here. Do your own research.Yeah, that just happened to coincide with investors bailing out.That was amazing. Thanks!> Fair; but it’s CNBC.. it’s their job to sensationalize everything to drive clicks.

Sure, the goal is that people reading here take a more critical look at the news they read.  VC billionare says XYZ sounds very authoritative.  Guy who got rich on facebook and has a pretty mediocre track record since then repeatedly says sensational things is a bit more questionable. 

My hope is people dig beyond the headline and try to figure out if there's actually a noteworthy news item here.  In this case there is not.  And to be frank almost every thread that makes it to the top of /r/investing is, in reality, not a very noteworthy news item for investing purposes.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-family_office

What happened, that the other guy doesn't understand, is that the entire VC fund that was social capital basically imploded to the point where they closed it down.  Chamath retained the legal entity and just utilized it for his and his two partner's personal endeavors.  That way he can fuck around and pretend like he's reporting these return figures over almost a decade but in reality it's just him and two other partner's investment pool.East Coast is best coast.I don't mean to be rude but I think you're not understanding how these entities work.  The firm was wound down - that means it failed.  Chalmath retained the legal entity and turned it in to a glorified MFO that he calls a VC firm.  The reports are unaudited statements based on valuations that Social Capital makes.

This is the same thing Softbank was doing, albiet likely less egregiously.  You fund a private entity and at the time value it at 20MM.  You then come back and do a second round two years later but for less stock and run the valuation at 60MM.  You then put in your annual report that you made 300% on whatever the company was with zero volatility.  Because that's how private funding works.  Did you make 300%?  I mean if you can sell to someone else at 60Mm valuation then sure but that's not been the norm in this world.  You can find tons of commentary describing how the quoted returns in VC are largely suspect at best due to the lack of active market.  General PE isn't as bad because a lot of these entities are audited and have comps/established firms but VC valuations should never be treated as accurate off the cuff - only their ability to offload at the stated values.  

The fund literally failed two years ago.  If that's not enough for you then nothing I can say is going to move the needle.  Like again not to be mean but I'm not really here to argue with someone that is trying to tell me a fund that very publicly failed is actually successful.  I can't even begin to wrap my head around what sort of misconception drives that sort of thing.I'm sure he did a great job and has a unique view that helped make Facebook great. He was very lucky to be at the right time and place as well as everyone else at FB. This still doesn't make him some kind of investing genius.Congrats on getting lucky and selling out to someone with less sense. You act as though you made some intelligent investment decision rather than blindly followed a herd. It's a speculative strategy, and obviously there's money to be made, but don't pretend for a minute you made money because Tesla is performing well. You made money because of speculative hype. You could have done that with Bitcoin. Or buying Jack in the Box at the bottom March.Weird how it went from 75% to 90% to fit your criteria.Predicting dollar collapse is basically a scare tactic. If the dollar actually collapsed the entire world economy would be falling apart and gold isn’t going to save you then.^ this. 

I never answer these questions.  And anyone that does is suspect as fuck. 

A good assumption is that everyone in this sub is a teenager or recently was one, until they prove themselves otherwise.  Click on the post histories of some of the people you see here expressing strong opinions, you might be surprised how many of them will tell you with full confidence to do something, and subsequently are asking how to ask a girl to prom.Lol. Think what you want. Dude's net worth is higher than ever.Btw your whole argument boils down to 2 things,

1) The fund was changed into something else = fund failed. This is obviously not a valid argument. It's like saying Bill Gates wanted to do something philantrophic with his life so he failed as a manager. 

2) The valuations are rigged. You say that with little to no evidence.

So in short, I provide numbers, you provide speculation/non-sequiturs.You don't get it. Early executives build companies into what they are. That shit isn't luck.

If the Zuck called you in 2004 and said he had a job for you then Facebook would not have been as successful.That guy is very good at calculating the exact numbers of his returns, but doesn't bother looking up the exact numbers of the companies he's investing in. Not the best way to invest.. Got lucky once and now we all have to keep hearing it.🤣 ok guyYou're missing the forest for the treesAgreed but if you believe if the dollar will just take a hit, not actually collapse, then gold seems like a fairly good investment, no?That isn’t really related to the previous discussion at all.I just can't fathom where to begin addressing the lack of understanding here.  Bill Gates runs a charity.  That's not the same as a failed VC fund.  Believe whatever you want to but man it's just amazing to me how confident you are given your understanding of private investments here.This guy is kind of being a dick and not giving Chamath credit for his billions and genius with facebook, but growing a company like facebook vs allocating capital, are vastly different things. 

Especially trying to allocate capital in a "socially conscious" way like Chamath did, which is frankly why it failed. I could be a bit biased as tobacco stock investor though.Yeah, I mean I was a child so I don't see how that could've worked out in a positive way. 

But, I think you're the one who doesn't get it. I'm not saying that the  FB execs weren't great. I'm not saying Chmamath wasn't great at helping FB grow. I can acknowledge the work they did. But it does require a lot of luck to be at the right place and time grow into one of the largest and powerful companies like FB. It requires a lot of luck to have the opportunity to be part of that - regardless of talent. But don't take it from me, [Mark](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mark-zuckerberg-success-mine-only-190652552.html) and [Chamath](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/business/corner-office-chamath-palihapitiya-social-capital.html) will both tell you it takes luck too.

You can be both great and lucky. And my point is that Chamath made his fortune helping building Facebook, which was a very lucky situation to amass such a fortune from, but this does not necessarily make him a great investor.  Yet, he will go around saying provocative things, throwing around crazy valuations, and people will think he has good investment ideas based on his success from FB. They're not equivalent.You don’t know that for sure. And anyway massage therapists and secretaries in early start ups get stock options too.Gold can be a nice diversifier but it’s more tied to sentiment than fundamentals of any sort so it’s hard to predict. The dollar depreciating vs a basket of currencies is not necessarily a positive for gold.  But all the same gold can add diversity to a portfolio so if you’re looking to lower volatility then it’s worth considering.That depends on your definition of success.  Getting out of the VC game was a very smart move, not a "failure"look at the dudes post about gold lol you should not waste time hereYou literally have no solid arguments here except your don’t understand VC’. Ok. Time to exit the conversation. Enjoy your day.>This guy is kind of being a dick and not giving Chamath credit for his billions and genius with facebook

I gave him credit for the job he did at Facebook. I'm just saying to be that extraordinarily successful from one venture requires quite a bit of luck as well. He probably did great at AOL too, but that went in a very different direction. I'm not sure why everyone has such a hard time acknowledging the role that luck plays in these things. The funny thing is, if you look at my reply below, Zuck and Chamath will both tell you the same thing.

>but growing a company like facebook vs allocating capital, are vastly different things. 

And this is my whole point, which people won't even engage because they apparently got so distressed by the "luck" statement. Yeah， Chamath - smart guy, hard worker, good at growing companies. But, this doesn't make him some kind of genius investor. Yet, he will always say some provocative thing about a company he is interested in, probably to create a narrative around it (growth), and people eat it up. Why? Probably because he made a fortune from FB. Which was not a result of allocating capital.Yeah no.  His fund failed.  Idk why there’s so much revisionist history here among redditors but it was super publicized at the time as a major failure in strategy.  He can say whatever he wants about “getting out” but the reality of the situation is that he lost investors and needed to wind the fund down. That isn’t a choice he made. 

And like nobody cares about net worth.  The point of financial commentary is people who are experts offering insight.  A guy who made billions by getting in early on Facebook is nice but his only public venture in to investing ended in a failed fund so it’s a bit curious why he’d always get interviews - until we remember CNBC makes news to be shared on social media feeds.I'm not arguing.  I'm explaining to you that you're wrong and that the entity you are trying to praise literally quite publicly failed two years ago.

That's the problem with the new people here.  Y'all just assume you have some sort of firm grasp on everything and that you should argue rather than listen and learn.  Someone correcting you isn't an argument.  We're not discussing theory, strategy, or something that is up for debate.  The thing failed.  The legal entity was retained and turned in to an MFO.  Both of those are factual statements.  VC valuation and performance is entirely based on internal valuation.  Also a factual statement.  Nothing up for argument here.   

Good luck out there I guess.> I gave him credit for the job he did at Facebook. I'm just saying to be that extraordinarily successful from one venture requires quite a bit of luck as well.

You literally just repeated both of my points lol[deleted]OkThey're not. 

And this is less of a take on Chalmath personally and more of a take on CNBC deliberately interviewing certain people so that they say certain things that make for extremely clickable social media/reddit fodder.  The gripe here is with media - I'm sure Chalmath is no moron.  But social did indeed fail and his track record as an investor is spotty at best.  The question is if he didn't say such sensational things about certain high profile tech plays would he get airtime?  Probably not.Speaking frankly, MCS has actually learned something over the past couple of years here. You can see it in his comment quality in r/investing and in r/econmonitor. Yes, his punchy style might not be to your taste, but his level of understanding is progressing. Others, sadly, however, don't have a growth mindset and react negatively to new perspectives that don't match their own. (I, for example, don't agree with simplistic Buffettisms that value investors are so fond of, but I definitely haven't ignored what he's said and written.)  My (unsolicited) advice is to not focus so much on stylistic points and proceed with a beginner's mind. Ommm.[deleted][deleted]Do you genuinely think they don't intentionally bring him on to generate content that has higher clickrates?

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*Good quarter, MSFT has run up a lot this year, so I didn't expect them to explode or anything.No surprises here, keep it movingSo I’m new to investing but what the hell is the reason for the drop?

If they performed better then expected why the huge immediate drop off following this announcement.

That was the sharpest decline I’ve seen yet.Impressive. Down after hours though... I guess investors are selling the news.Bing revenue down 18%
Should I buy some Google puts?Azure growth dropped from 59% growth last year to 47%. Covid was supposed to accelerate cloud growth not drop it more.I always enjoy good news.Damn I was hoping it would be slammed below $200 so I could load up on the cheap again.Why did Miscrosoft went down when they beat the earning?Thoughts on the drop and where the stock will be a week or so from now?So if everyone was expecting earning to be good. Why didn't the predicted expectations adjusted to reflect that?Ahh yes, the usual microsoft circlejerk$MSFT down, $TSLA up. $MSFT is clearly vaporware and investors will continue to flock to $TSLA as it is the next cloud giant. Boomers think it's just another car company, but those in the know understand that Tesla is a software company. They will come out with their own AI as a platform service to power driverless cars and share data of roads. They will be the next huge Cloud service as every Tesla driver will act as a node in the cloud network in order to achieve maximum cloud uptime. That's right, Tesla Distributed Cloud Service. Each participant in the network will be compensated with Dogecoin. This will make it essentially free to charge your Tesla. Step aside Natella because Musk is here to take over. Cathie Woods is modest in her call of a valuation of $6800/share for Tesla - holding Tesla stock will essentially be a risk-free asset that does not have a limit to how high it can grow in value. Nations will be holding Tesla stock to increase their wealth. Tesla will power the world.Stock goes down with earnings exceeding expectations... okThey’ve been performing solidly since Satya took over. I think people underestimate Microsoft because they don’t see past their consumer facing products. I’ll never forget the amount of high paid WS analysts playing down Microsoft due to slower console sales completely ignoring the 800lb guerrilla that is Azure.Like TSLA?gotta disagree... CV19 in 2020 has sent shocks everywhere.   only online retail was a certainty.Azure growth was less than expected (+47% vs +55% Est) which is probably the main reason why, but there's also a good chance that when cash markets open MSFT goes up anyway.It happens a lot with stocks that get good earnings but are already very expensive. Happened with Netflix and Dominoes Pizza where great earnings still ended up tanking the stock.Good earnings do not tank stocks. To think this is a logical assumption is beyond stupid. It is more likely that institutional investors needed to exercise their puts and rigged the stock downward during after hours trading. This is generally the hour in which large and powerful investors get to commit large scale fraud without being caught.Profit taking, moving to other more attractive assets, etc. Buy the dip tomorrow.People didn't expect them to do well, so they sold their shares. Happened everytime before earning.

You will see a sharp rising tomorrow morning.

\>That was the sharpest decline I’ve seen yet.

Zoom out the graph, thats less than 3% decline.Expecting the markets to be rational LUL'it was priced in'. everyone knew they were going to beat expectations before hand.people want 40% growth, not 13%Happens to many stocks. People will sell even before the report in anticipation> So I’m new to investing but what the hell is the reason for the drop?

More people wanted to sell than wanted to buy, thus the price had to be lowered to entice buyers.Their only shortfall was less-than-expected growth of Azure. It's a huge source of revenue for MSFT and a good indicator of how well MS is doing compared to their competitors in that market.The physical locations being closed likely. Long term not an issue so I'd you want, it's a good time to buy I guesswhere do you think does Bing searches went ;)I doubt people stopped using bing, it was probably reduced ad rates, which caused revenue to fallLong term adoption sure, but not in 2020, you’re not investing big dollars into a cloud platform when top line revenue is tanking thanks to COVID and you’re looking at an impending cash crunch.

Year | Subscribers | Percent Increase| Number Increase
---|---|---|---
Year 1 | 100 | - | -
Year 2 | 159 | 59% | 59
Year 3 | 234 | 47% | 75

When your percentage growth numbers are that high, they're essentially unsustainable. Their raw number increase would still be an increase over the previous year.What was AWS?  Gaining or losing market share is more important than % growth for an industry that is obviously growing but at variable rates each year.Same, got in at $154 but really wish I had bought more.Maybe cause the fucking thing is up %50 in the past 4 months?I can almost guarantee that you'll make more money buying and holding MSFT then trying to day trade it. It's a solid company with great potential for more growth in cloud computing and MS office looks to be ready to make some serious strides.   


No one can tell you where the stock will be in a week. Satya could die of a heart attack. Bill Gates could sell all his stock at once and send the price crashing down. In the long term though, it's a great company to be a partial owner in.This is the dumbest thing I’ve ever read.I’m into this new copypastaJust imagine if Satya had been around to get in on the mobile phone game. I loved my Windows phone. Great camera, great UI. Just poor management at the time.Azure where everything is always in beta and documentation sucks? Got to give it to MSFT though. Their products are so ingrained into enterprise culture the suits just default to anything MSFT. The other big reason is because Amazon is somehow a competitor and folks refuse to use AWS. As a developer working at a consulting firm I hate working with Azure but as an investor I can see the power behind the Microsoft culture in big enterprises and am bullish on MSFT.>completely ignoring the 800lb guerrilla that is Azure.

\^You need a computer to use online retailers. And an Xbox to play while you wait for your package.Just observing the slides provided in their earnings report, it clearly paints a picture of how not just Azure growth has declined, but other parts of the business as well. 

Even Microsoft subscriptions growth has dropped in half. LinkedIn also, which resulted in layoffs recently.

Gaming is rock solid though.They lost money this quarter. On just 13% revenue growth. How is that good for a 37x P/E established company?I used to think this was a stock market conspiracy theory until a couple years ago when I was tracking AMD. The Nasdaq website tracks blocks of shares being bought/sold. Every few minutes there were blocks of shares (100 or more) sold at ~$0.50 less than asking. Especially on Fridays. There were 1000s of shares being sold over the course of 30 minutes with sellers leaving money on the table. The only reason I could imagine was that institutions were trying to keep the price down to protect their covered callsHow the hell is this comment upvoted?

The question was: If they performed better then expected why the huge immediate drop off **following this announcement**.

And the answer: 
> People didn't expect them to do well, so they sold their shares. Happened everytime before earning.

What??? People didn't expect them to do well, but they did well, so people sold their shares?Alright yeah this is my first quarter announcement that I’ve actually been invested in, so that’s comforting news at least. Thanks.

I meant in the context of the time I’ve been investing lmao which is like right when the market started to become shit again.I mean yeah you’re not wrong 😂

I specified being new for a reason because I feel like that’s definitely not an assumption I should make lmao....it is rational, though. Azure growth slowed unexpectedly. 

Even if you have a really good quarter, if the market was expecting a great quarter your stock drops a bit.[deleted]Oh of course I was hoping for better as well but I didn’t anticipate a sell off like that.

Granted I hardly know what I’m talking about so in the conventional wisdom that may be the right decision for all I know.People expect volatility like Tesla and Shopify. Most of them are not interested in even looking at fundamentals.Is that actually worth it consistently or a gamble based on the report?

Couldn’t you theoretically just buy back everything early on or is it gonna go back up high in pre market hours?I don't think it has anything to with that.  That was announced a while ago.Lol what? This is probably like the least likely reason possible.No where.
First ever non growth quarter for Bing since realignment of divisions.

Google was Strong in Q1 still, gut there has to be some Impact.duck.com?You think Google and FB did the same?
Tomorrow is Verizon if they have a sharp decline too, I can't believe FB and Google will not have the same issue even if by a lower percentage. Because if you have less marketing dollars to spend, you go where you get most bang for your buck.

But yeah with both Alphabet and FB at an all-time high I can't resist the temptetion to play the earnings. Long-term they're fine and better of ofc.Agreed. The speed in which the stock price has increased in the last year doesn’t suggest that though. Market is looking for immediate adaptionAmazon earnings is tmr but the growth for them is at around 33% recently.I don't know why you're being downvoted--this is the right answer. 

People need to expand their time horizon, MSFT had extremely high expectations built in and Cloud growth was underwhelming (47% v. 55% expected).Agree with your points. But Bill Gates doesn’t actually own a large percentage of Microsoft anymore. Various reports have him at 1% or less. He diversified his portfolio a long time ago to make his charity more resilient.It's a memeOpen your mindMSFT should be releasing the Duo phone this fall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kU78s9ExFFA
Could be a game changer, or a flop again. We'll see.Apple is only just now integrating everything that the windows phone 10 had. That thing was ahead of the competition by a few years.Windows phone was the only genuine competition to iPhone.
Encryption out of the box. Fast and intuitive interface. Great build quality and camera by Nokia.

Poor as fuck management.
I hope they bring it back.Windows Phone 10 + yellow Nokia with Carl Zeiss lens was the best shit I ever, ever held in my hand. Hands down. Still salty about the miserable end.Is everyone here missing the fact that Microsoft makes the majority of their money on B2B sales of O365 subscriptions, Windows 10 licenses, SQL Server licenses, Azure subscriptions, etc.? Retail computing and Xbox sales is a fraction of their total revenue.They are doing amazing and a huge beat. Stock going way up tomorrow. If people liked it at $112 today before earnings, they will run it up tomorrow after such great earnings. Beautiful stock, going way up no doubt. Revenue grew 13% and they have beat earnings every quarter for years.They didn’t?Lmao I know. Such a nonsensical answer. I swear r/investing has the most number of newbies and uninformed investors that just repeat and upvote each other in an echo chamber. I’m not going to try to make sense of every price action because earning is always a crapshoot play. It’s not just a simple beat/miss vs expected. In this particular case, I’d say that most people already expect MSFT to beat handily so this is a “sell the news” event.Highly upvoted as well this subreddit is such a joke.If people didn't expect them to do well they wouldn't be sitting at a 37x P/E. Now 40x+ P/E.op was saying they sold their shares before earnings,  ...not after\> What??? People didn't expect them to do well, but they did well, so people sold their shares?

You are twisting what I was saying.

I assumed that people sold it before report came out.I think they are saying that before earnings people expected them to suck, so they sold right before earning came out. Idk if that’s right, but that’s how I read it.MSFT isnt really the kind of stock where you worry about their earnings reports. Just hold it and hold it long! They are born winners.Wtf? Why are people up voting this? This isn't how it works, after hour trading exist, the reason it went went down after hours, is just like why nflx and snap went down, they were priced at above perfection leading up to earnings, so even though they had great quarters, people were gambling that the quarters would be even better leading up to earnings. The stock moves on earnings based on expectations.Good opportunity to add sharesJust be safe out there.  It's fucking crazy man.It's not actual data distributed, its just common sense during a pandemic and the era of online everythingI think last quarter (Microsoft also performed well) there was a steep increase in share price.  So... as always, a good earnings beat could mean stocks go up or stocks go down.Sure, but the company coming out and confirming they dont know what's gonna happen wasnt confirmed a long time agoFrom what I've read its gonna have a big hill to climb. Its going to be running the older snapdragon 855, less ram then most new phones and probabaly more expensive then nost phones.I'm a Microsoft fan....the Duo will not be a have changer lol.I'm interested in it, but I'd personally wait for the Duo 2 lolI'm pretty deep into the iOS ecosystem now so I wouldn't switch back but it was a bit of a letdown when my iPhone 6 couldn't use the wireless charging pad in my car but the Windows phone that I drowned in a lake could.Like what? Tiles that were widgets, as if Android and desktop platforms haven't had those before? how novelYes 100%. I had that phone and the camera with those lenses was insane for macro shots. I was living in Grand Teton National Park and the pictures it took were incredible for the time.I honestly forgot when I posted that comment. Too busy trying to be snarky."Beautiful stock", "$112" is this a bot comment? haha

&#x200B;

In all seriousness, for a growth stock, growth matters more than revenue. Considering growth is slowing, we are unlikely to see anything better than the share price going back to today's open throughout tomorrow.yoinksYeah lost money was a fubar on my part. They had drop in earnings. Doesn't change my position. I still think given the price they should be growing much more quickly.r/investing is so much less knowledgeable than any other investing sub. Yes including r/wallstreetbets. Plenty of people there that really know their shit and glad to spread knowledge when they aren’t memeing 

Which makes sense because this is the gateway sub. But it makes for shitty discourseI think it comes down to Azure

Azure has been MSFT's cash cow recently, but underperformed (47% actual growth, so markedly lower than the 55% estimated)Take my upvote.What you said isn't technically wrong, it's just wrong because the context is discussing earnings report, not just immediate post-market activity - the stock continued to drop after the report came out hence why you are being downvoted[deleted]Netflix missed earnings but you are spot on about both really.  They were overbought and the market sorted it out.I likely will pick up a few more of it dosent recover in the pre market. 

I already had 8 so that sudden plummet was a bit shocking to me lmao.Alright thanks, I’m still learning this and didn’t even know it was end of the year until I saw it go down 3 percent in 5 minutes lmao just hope I can recoup that soon. Thanks> I still think given the price they should be growing much more quickly.

Can you add some numbers behind your argument? What would be a good growth rate for that P/E ratio in this environment of low interests rates that have inflated equities?know any good ones?Only 47% growth lol, better than the accounting fraud Tesla and Musk are up to.Yeah I know the context is wrong due to the time that comment being read. That guy saw my comment 3 hours after the result was posted, whereas I commented it right after the result was posted.

The context was completely different because of the time being discussed.> if it looks like there will be another COVID crash

And how will you make that judgement?Can I borrow your crystal ball when you're finished with it?What’d you buy at? I have 45 shares and am down $50 today so I can’t imagine you lost very much unless you bought super highYou're going to have to wait a bit while he Google's what those words mean.Nah man, earnings reports are available within minutes after the bell, if not instantly for some investors. By the time the op comment was made the market had already reacted to the actual earnings. So no, technically even then the context was not different.Hahaha. I always give someone the benefit of the doubt and hopefully through asking some questions we can get to something more substantial than "it's too high" or "it's too low."**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*Actually bond ETFs did run into liquidity issues and nearly collapsed. The Feds took drastic unprecedented action which prevented the outcome.There was a collapse. The speed of the fall of the market was unprecedented. That was the small exit door. Many ETFs traded far below their NAV.

Then there was huge stimulus by the government, and this liquidity provided by the government (also unprecedented at these levels) helped hugely in the market recovering.

As they say, 'there are no free lunches', so we will have to pay in a different way due to this interventionism.Like Bale says in The Big Short “I may have been early but I’m not wrong.”

Unfortunately after the fed’s insane policies meant to prop up garbage like Blackrock, the other guy’s response of” “they’re the same thing!” Seems more prudent than in the filmHe was right. The only reason we aren't at SPX sub 1000 right now is because the fed basically backstopped the entire bond market. I'm sure he made big bucks shorting this market, like Bill Ackman.I mean, he's not wrong he just misjudged what the fed would do.  He expected the regular \\.  They went with /.  Certainly some shorts got fucked up along their path so it could have been signaled clearer what the plan was, but overall I think markets are back to a relative normal for where interest rates are going.

We're still kinda fucked, interest rates both cannot go up, and they cannot go negative, so that has it's own effect on price signals for risk assets when you both have to rely on the alternative and the market expects that.Okay, you are deluded if you think that Michael Burry's call to fame was just one bet in 2008.

In 2001, his fund was up 55%, sp500 12%

In 2002, his fund was up 16%, sp500 - 22%

In 2003, his fund was up 50%, sp500 28%

you get the ideaYo, we still have massive unemployment and there is still a pandemic changing people's behaviors. You are acting like the market we are living in now isn't a bubble being inflated by a blank check from the Fed.Every great investor, every smart person is wrong frequently, why does that make them a broken clock?It's early yet.On the flip side. Buffett has been wrong multiple times and everyone still blows him with no gag reflex.He is also very wrong about the Real Estate market until he is right.You sound pretty smug about him being wrong, and yet ETFs using oil futures in April showed exactly what can happen when ETFs go wrong. Now the financial institutions are shuttering vix and other funds that have high risk of going pear shaped too.Because even if he’s wrong 1,000 times he only has to be right 1 time for bears to treat him like he’s some sort of prophet.As everyone said here, he wasnt wrong. Fed went crazy.

Curious what your response is u/boyinahouseMichael Burry was also "wrong" about the Housing Market for a year until it fucked up.

The thing is, Burry uses actual logic to base his investment decisions on and everything that happened this year was in direct opposite of logic (and even morality, depending on your perspective). How was he supposed to know the entire US government would band together in unprecedented and grossly corruptive fashion to create a 2 trillion dollar stimulus package to buy all the bad debt of the country's largest corporations, allow real estate investors to write off losses, stemming even *before* the virus, and throw citizens a one-off 1.5k "fuck off" check whilst lazily putting all state governments on the hook for providing unemployment benefits using outdated and poorly-maintained unemployment systems? 

How was Burry supposed to guess Tesla, the meme stock of the year, would fly to the moon on memes and... memes? How was Burry supposed to know that Republicans would force all politicians to vote on removing all liability for Coronavirus cases stemming from work, thus elminating the biggest and most catastrophic burden companies could face? How was Burry supposed to know the U.S. would do the polar opposite of every other country in the world?

It's not that nobody "noticed" he was wrong. Literally, every person making predictions this whole year has been wrong. Like seriously, JP Morgan still lists Tesla's Fair Market value at something like $250 now. It's nearing 2k in price.He didn't anticipate the Fed lowering interest rates to zero, pumping money into the economy, and doing unprecedented stuff like buying corporate bonds. Can't really fault him for that, did anyone predict that?

> Before the market crash in Feb/March, I'd see a new post every other day about the "index fund bubble" that was being touted around by Burry. His key premise was that a massive sell-off would lead to a major market collapse due to the "small exit door" theory. Three or however many circuit breakers later, we saw that index funds held up remarkably well.  

Also, he predicted these things under the presumption of normal (i.e, non-pandemic) market conditions. Both fiscal and monetary policy have been so extreme in response to the pandemic that it'd throw the old model of thinking right out the window.Not really fair to judge the guy when the Fed played the Deus Ex Machina card.ETFs did have valaution issues, which if sustained could prompted their collapse. The mistake of Blurry was to rely on fundamentals/understimate FED's ability to emerge from thin air

 [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-29/fed-becomes-no-3-holder-of-world-s-biggest-corporate-bond-etf](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-29/fed-becomes-no-3-holder-of-world-s-biggest-corporate-bond-etf)"You just have to make a big bet and be right once; you're famous and set for life."

That was about as good as it could get for Burry. A lot of his long positions didn't even make sense. Long Gamestop? Seriously? Look at how that turns out.

For all the famous shortsellers, they make $$ like once a decade.The only ones who take his words as gospel are Business Insider. Everyone else knows he's just another voice thinking he can predict dice rolls better than everyone else.His small exit door arguement is fundamentally sound, I think part of the issue of it not playing out that way is as money floods back into us paper and equities it creates an artificially soft landing when you contrast it with the stark economic data 

I guess another way to put it is yes index funds have some bubble built in but if people keep flying into us assets it wont matter, supply and demand.He wasn't just right in 2008, he's be right since like '98 or whenever he started his internet blog.Dumb bot removed my comment. Rearrange the letters in Burry’s name. 

Y u [the rest]

Just like in 08. He has no idea just how rigged it all is.Nope. He was right. Without FED intervention, the markets would have collapsed. Basically, the FED cheated to save the "free" market.Did you sleep through March and April? Surely you must have at least seen all the JPOW memes.. anything??Actually, you are wrong , OP. Thank the Feds for not having to deal with his correct call.Winter is comingHey OP, you're missing the key part.  Burry wasn't saying the market was going to crash.  He said people are investing in these large cap index funds too much, causing small caps to be undervalued, so we should all start investing in small caps.

This is and was horrible advice.  If you look back in the last 100 years you'll be hard pressed to find a time at the top of the market where small caps did well.  One of the reasons for this is small caps fall quite a bit more than large cap stocks during a recession.  As people become risk adverse they begin to avoid small caps during the late stage economic cycle.

So either Burry didn't realize the market was going to collapse, which is absurd.  Small caps not getting the love they should be is a tell-tell sign there is going to be a recession within the next 6 months to 4 years, but there was all sorts of 101 common investor tells like the yield curve inverting (6 to 16 month heads up), how the Fed changed interest rates (6 months heads up), and so on.  So I'd like to believe the guy isn't that off and he saw what everyone else did, but then why did he suggest buying small cap stocks knowing a recession is around the corner?  Michael Burry's advice is often wrong.  I think this is just a case of people not doing their homework and blindly following what they think is a leader.Past performance is no guarantee of future results[removed]We’ve only been in the crisis for 5ish months and the crisis is far from over. I’m not sure what’s gonna happen and I’m sure Burry doesn’t know either but I think it’s a bit too early to say who’s right.

*Before anyone says I’m just salty that I didn’t buy during the dip or anything, I bought in April and I’m satisfied with the gains. Didn’t catch the bottom, but it doesn’t rly matter*Burry wasn't really touting the small exit door so much as others were. Burry's ideas are more about under- or over-valuations related to index inclusion/exclusion.     

[**Full breakdown of all those different arguments here**](https://bestinterest.blog/index-fund-bubble/)**.**OP is getting shat on in this thread[removed]It happened just as most people expected. Large liquid equity ETFs had no issues completely contrary to what he predicted. 


Small illiquid bond ETFs had no bids because the bonds were illiquid and potentially worthless.


He was wrong, no collapse or anything of the like came as a result of indexing.Burry is the kind of guy who will tell you there is a stock market bubble every day for the next 5 billion years and then when the sun finally burns out and the solar system becomes a frozen wasteland and all life ends, he'll turn and say he told you so.I felt he is just saying things to advertise his fund.Was wrong about TLRD. Also, lot of Burry fanboys riding to his defense in this thread.I don't recall fully what he said though I believe his main premise was that ETFs and passive investing would cause certain small caps to be volatile and mispriced, providing and opportunity for arbitrage.

I may be wrong but I don't think he ever expected the whole market to crash.If the other comments are right then I can't imagine he wouldn't see the government coming to the rescue again 🙄 He still has hope the system isn't rigged!Lol noHe wasn't wrong, just early.We're still at half time give it timeDoom and gloom predictions that turn out to be correct get all the attention, while the many, MANY, **MANY** wrong ones are ignored.

In the vast majority of cases, when the market tells you that you are wrong, you are actually wrong.  Going short, betting against everyone else and conventional wisdom, especially on never before occurred events, pays off so rarely that when it does, there is a movie about it.  

I wonder how much money that overrated movie the Big Short has cost short sellers, put buyers, and cash holders in the past few years.  Even now you read comments saying "hE wAs RiGhT bUt ThE FeD!!!!!!!!"He was right about water.You’re flat out wrong, not Burry. There were major liquidity crashes. The Fed decided to unleash unlimited money.He was right, the fed just used cheat codesGosh. The arrogance of OP.And how his performance so far? Like multiyear performance.

Actually he was right! 

I was ready for a crisis and bet on it, exactly as he did. And it give me a very nice result in the middle of march storm.

What was the game changing, a Covid-19. No one could predict it. A crisis was multiplied by many folds by it, and FED acted like crazy. And when FED printing money, any crisis could hold. It has another consequence, but this is a different story.If was only a problem for ETFs. Well “only” might be a bad choice of word, but what I mean is that for regular index funds, it’s not a problem. All their assets are very liquid and can be sold during the day and paid out the day after to whoever sold their share of the fund. ETFs are different as they need to adjust their holdings (with some leeway) in real-time. Those were the funds saved by the federal reserve.100% this.

Not sure what OP wanted. 15 circuit breaker days in a row ?Yep, he was right, but of course couldn't forsee the Fed intervening in such a direct way and in such a massive scale.

So in a sense the pandemic and the Feds response short-circuited the collapse. The Fed would have probably stepped in even without the pandemic.

I think we now have a pretty clear mandate since 08, the Fed will backstop the markets like never before... It can do this because of USD global reserve currency powers, there's no need for any large important industries to collapse, even if they get greedy..  isn't socialized Capitalism great?Sounds like Michael Burry was 100% right.Can you cite a source? Matt Levine talked about these bond liquidity issues and wrote quite a bit about how none of the fears came to pass, since traders were able to transact through the relatively liquid ETF and not with illiquid bonds.

Source: [Bond market liquidity did great](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-11/bond-market-liquidity-did-great)The Fed to OP: Am I a joke to you?I 100% disagree , bond ETFs held up quite well.

Now how could I say this when the ETFs were trading at huge percentages under NAV? Well I would argue those NAV prices were wrong. 

Bonds have pretty low liquidity , how do you price a corporate bond that hasn't traded in days? Or 10 billion bonds who had $100 trade today with a huge spread? Well you sort of just guess and that how those bonds were priced .

To me the ETFs were pricing bonds property the very liquid bonds prices were not being priced correctly because no one knew what price to put on them because there was no volumeBOND ETF’s?! Are we investing or sticking our money in the bank? Give me a break. 

He’s discussing equities, specifically the s/p 500. Burry was referencing the s/p. Want to know why bond etfs have had liquidity issues? Because bond returns are a joke and will be a joke for the foreseeable future, and it doesn’t make sense to hold them. 

Even some of the big players are predicting the traditional retirement model of 60/40 which has been the standard practice for a century needs to be adjusted more to equities (Morgan Stanley predicting 2.8%/year) since these bond-heavy portfolios are barely keeping up with inflation.And it’s not like the underlying cause has gone away.

The predominance of passive index investing is still only increasing. It’s only like 50% right now, but that number has grown steadily over the last 30 years.

Price discovery will eventually die and when that happens who the fuck knows.I think it's not completely wrong to argue that in such times the NAV of a liquid asset is more realistic than the value of the illiquid underlying asset. So if you held the bonds instead of the ETF instead, you couldn't have sold them at "NAV" either.>Many ETFs traded far below their NAV.

To be fare the NAV for those bonds were priced wrong

If you held some BBB bond and it was priced at $100 you probably couldn't get $100 for it if you wanted to sell it. If you wanted to sell maybe you could get $90 but again the bond offical price was $100

Knowing that when the ETF traded below NAV it seems to me they were pricing the bonds correctly , the NAV was off.I remember seeing FLOT at like a 12% discount to NAV.IT'S THE SAME THINGIts pretty crazy how many people thing the markets naturally go up and that this whole movement wasn't straight up manipulation.

Nancy Pelosi literally confirmed today what we all knew, and the funny thing is she wasn't even asked about it, she kind of just blurted it out in an interview. There is a floor to the market that the fed / administration allows it to drop, which is clearly S&P 3000, and then at that point they throw the whole farm at it to pump it back up.

Her exact quote from todays interview with Wolf Blitzer:

"So, you know, they're bolstering the stock market.  Okay, there's a floor to the stock market.  Everybody knows it's not going below a certain place.  That's okay.  Let's have a floor for America's working families.">We're still kinda fucked, interest rates both cannot go up, and they cannot go negative

Why do you think they cannot go negative?Europe went negative.>I mean, he's not wrong he just misjudged what the fed would do.

That's being wrong, though.> I think markets are back to a relative normal for where interest rates are going.

I'd say they're at minimum 25% inflated even for an optimistic outcome to this year, and they're completely ignoring any outcomes from Q2 earnings as if it doesn't even exist. 

Basically they decided it's a given that everyone is screwed this quarter, and everyone will recover at some point in the future, so current valuations don't matter and we're basing valuations on 5 years down the road after this crisis is over.So if I  interpret this correctly though.

Current stock market recovery is fully because of the US government/Fed keeping the stock market afloat.

At some point though knowing how politics will work this  stimulus has to/will end and depending on how things are going the markets can go either way correct?what are you talking about?

even 18 years old with $500 in robinhood account thinks they knew better about investment than Warren Buffet nowadays.There are also multiple phase 3 vaccine trials already underway and these vaccines are already being mass produced before even being approved because that’s how confident they are that they’ll be giving out doses before 2020 is over*"A generally accurate clock is wrong occasionally due to leap seconds, general relativistic effects, etc."*That dick has gave the market plenty of joy for years, excuse them if they got attached to it.Because he is right more than he is wrong by a huge margin.Those aren’t really index funds though? It’s hardly reasonable to call out ETFs following all manner of weird and wacky indexes, while ignoring the fact that the funds following the major indices (NASDAQ, S and P) hardly cared.How are oil futures relevant for index fund etfs? Even the problems with the ETFs using those futures wasn't with them being ETFs, it was with the oil futures. And neither of those things have anything to do with index funds.This is a fair observation. Could do without the "you sound pretty smug about him being wrong". :)>Can't really fault him for that, did anyone predict that?

Doesn't mean he wasn't wrong, though.The fuck he is trying to predict then, if he can’t include this potential outcome in his forecasts? 
All the rhetoric about “market is going to crash” is getting really boring. All of those forecasts(especially the ones being compared to Great Depression) condemning us to collapse leaving nothing except of feeling of sensationalism and wasted money.Of course you can fault him for that.

The only reason it didn't eventuate into a bigger problem was because of Fed liquid cash injection.No idea what you're talking about, the credit spread was ridiculous and all the illiquid bonds were trading far below NAV. If the Feds didn't pump liquid cash straight into the bond market, we would very likely have seen a bigger crash for all assets.>Because bond returns are a joke and will be a joke for the foreseeable future, and it doesn’t make sense to hold them.

Long term bonds return 20% in the last year, not sure how 20% is a jokeMy understanding was that Burry was referring to bond ETFs, and as far as I'm aware never mentioned SP500. Happy to be proven wrong if you have a source claiming otherwise.BND has been up 4.38% since 2007. I put most of my emergency fund in them.If you want good return with moderate risk and exposure to bonds, the leveraged bond ETFs like TMF have performed pretty well.  That would kind of suck to be holding that thinking you're doing pretty well and then the fund collapses.Bond markets have more liquidity than any shitty ETF, if you meet the bid.It's not completely wrong, only mostly wrong. When you buy an ETF, it's a basket of securities, so there is no way of identifying the price of any particular security within the basket. You can only go the other way. You can construct the baskets with the underlying prices, but not the other way around.

So if the ETF diverges, it's meaningless to say it's more realistic than the value of the underlying.

And there were lots of instances where the bond market was more liquid and deeper than the ETF, and I personally know people who profited off that arbitrage.The number of bond market experts after reading Matt Levine...

The ETF is a basket. You cannot reverse engineer the individual bond prices from the basket price. So if the price is not the same as the NAV, then you can't even compare them.I see you're a cultured gentleman as well.Loòóôõöøől that quote

Ok bears u got your once a decade moment of glory. Back to pumping!

Also that working families phrase. Alluding to the fact that the stock market is armericas pension system. Its mental it ever got to that pointCentral banks have said it messes up price signals, so they will try to avoid it here.Yes, and we won't because central banks saw it messes up price signals there and is therefore not good policy.Problem is the markets can ignore the problem until the economy starts to recover. Think about it — if you had gotten a bargain in march and were sitting on +40% why would you sell? The market wants this to be a V so it will be a V. It will hold onto the gains until something catastrophic happens and that may never come. 

The market, through force of sheer will, can erase the impact of corona until such time as normal growth can take hold.Are you aware of how sensitive equity prices are to discount rate changes when using something like discounted cash flow? A change from a 4 percent to 3 percent rate, if expected to hold for a while, can massively boost present valueYea, literally none of the experts who are game planning this scenario have us back to normal until the end of next year, at the earliest and that assumes a successful vaccine with full public buy in to be vaccinated. Good luck with that.

The financials of this economy will not continue on as they are for another year and a half. They just won't.I admire your optimism.The damage is already done. Uncertainty leads to decrease in investments. It will take time to build it back up.>Those aren’t really index funds though?

Although index funds aren't exclusively ETFs, it's the way a lot of the indexes are traded. And the most likely component to melt down since the customer can directly sell them instantly.

> while ignoring the fact that the funds following the major indices (NASDAQ, S and P) hardly cared

I'm not sure why an ETF tracking a market index would be expected to care about a crisis in another ETF, just like if an S&P ETF melts down it won't have a *direct* impact on a Russell 2000 ETF.

My point was the overall principle of how the meltdown works - you have a financial instrument whether it's a future or an equity - and because of outside forces you get a lack of buyers. The ETFs being forced to balance their holdings as their shares are sold off amplifies the flood of selling.

Realistically in that scenario you have more circuit breakers and much longer timespan before you go to zero, because we've already had full market meltdowns and tried to put artificial measures in place to stop them. And based on their recent actions the fed would step in and buy ETFs at a certain point to save the retirements and pension funds.Yes, while those ETFs have their own set of issues, Burry's problem was not with those.

It's wrong to say 'they hardly cared'. The sell-off was probably the quickest and most violent in the history of markets. The Nasdaq performed well due to the nature of the disaster (tech benefited in some ways), and the historic level of stimulus and money pumping was a big factor in the S&P recovering.>Could do without the "you sound pretty smug about him being wrong". :)

I mean the whole OP is basically gloating about how other people were wrong, there isn't actually any valuable observation in it, just a dickhead trying to stick his thumb in the eye of someone he doesn't like and thinks is overrated.

I'm not a Burry follower, but I'll take someone useful and sometimes right any day over someone who only knows how to be salty about people with a higher profile than themselves.If OP hasn't sounded so smug, it would have not needed it, but OP was smug and doesn't seem to actually know what he's on about, so should get called out.>The fuck he is trying to predict then, if he can’t include this potential outcome in his forecasts?

The COVID-19 pandemic is the very definition of a black swan event. I don't think it's fair to condemn anyone for not seeing this, and the government's response, coming. Did anyone even predict it this way?

> All the rhetoric about “market is going to crash” is getting really boring. All of those forecasts(especially the ones being compared to Great Depression) condemning us to collapse leaving nothing except of feeling of sensationalism and wasted money. 

Then ignore it and continue dumping all your money into the stock market. The good thing about investing is that it lets you put your money where your mouth is and have skin in the game by betting money on what you believe in.Yes, that's going to happen with a weak business that had been mismanaged for years - a crisis is going to accelerate something that was already in considerable decline. Burry thought that there was one more puff in the cigar like his terrible short squeeze nonsense with Gamestop. He's not looking to improve these businesses, he's hoping for a short squeeze or other financial engineering and then moving on before they crumble. That's hope - whether during a crisis or not - and sometimes it doesn't work out, especially when dealing with a business like TLRD that was not in good shape even before this.was the ETF priced wrong or was the NAV priced wrong. There is an argument those NAV pricings were way off the and the ETFs were priced correctlyWhere are you seeing this? On the feds balance sheet, they've only put 40b into their SPVs for corporate etf bonds to date (75% of which came from the treasury CARES act). Is there somewhere else I should be looking?They didnt get smashed because of liquidity. They got smashed because those companies were insolvent and would not be able to pay the bonds that came due until the Fed came in and rained free funny money on everyone> illiquid bonds were trading far below NAV

I am confused; why think bond ETF failed because they were trading below NAV when you admit the underlying bond themselfs were trading below their own NAV?

Your argument is mostly against liquid bonds , not the ETFs . To me yes the bond priceing was messed up, you couldn't sell those individaul bonds for what they were priced

some BBB bond was priced at $100 but the spread was huge , if you were a holder and you wanted to sell you wouldn't get $100 you maybe would get $90.

All the ETF does is reflect the underlying assets if the underlying assets were priced at $100 but really worth $90, the bond ETFs priced them correctly by trading 10% under their NAV because NAV was priced wrong/r/investing has turned into /r/wallstreetbets since the fed intervened because they think that their prediction of 'market goes up' makes them smart rather than the fed buying trillions worth of securitiesbut that's the future of bonds? because we're at super low interest rates. odds of rates staying stable or going up seem much higher than going lower/negative and increasing the value of the bonds. right?[deleted]While also paying a monthly dividend of around 2%.Not all bonds are created equal. With your username, you should know that.

And bids were low.Did you watch/read big short? Sometimes there is no "bid". No company will actually buy at the quoted priceMy argument basically goes as follows:

> Ideally the price of the ETF would closely track the price of the underlying bonds. The way ETFs are supposed to work is that, if the ETF trades below net asset value, arbitrageurs will buy the ETF and sell the underlying bonds to make a risk-free profit, moving the prices back in line. If they trade out of line then something has gone wrong.

> (...)

> But one plausible interpretation here is that the ETFs were right and the underlying bonds were wrong. The ETFs traded liquidly, in large volumes between willing buyers and sellers; if they fell a lot, it’s because people were really worried about credit. The bonds traded less liquidly and were more fragmented (many bonds versus a single ETF). If they didn’t fall so much, it might be because no one wanted to trade at the new, lower, “correct” prices; if bonds just don’t trade, then you can’t see their price go down. It’s not that the ETF provides an illusion of liquidity; it’s that the bond market provides an illusion of stability.

https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-11/bond-market-liquidity-did-greatcould you sell the individual  bonds at what they were priced when calculating nav?For context, she actually wasn't talking about stocks being americas pension system. She was asked about the enhanced unemployment, and how republicans dont bat an eye at spending trillions to put a floor on the stock market. When it comes to working class people though, there is no floor, and she wants there to be a floor there just like there is with stocks so they are protected when shit hits the fan.Wealthiest 10% own 92% of all stocks, truly sounds like working families' pensions.Oh so *that* messes up price signals.... But buying bond etfs, then directly buying specific company bonds doesn't?Some central banks do it though. It's not like *changing* the interest rate either way doesn't mess up price signals, why should going a couple points down below zero should be any different than going a couple points down to one percent? I think when push comes to shove the FOMC may do it too.Price signals for when the economy recovers?I don't really see it as a *problem* so much as an absurdity to arbitrarily change valuation tactics when you don't like the results of the market has been using for a century. It isn't a problem because the market is a market, so if everyone decides to value companies based on how many unicorn farts they can bottle in a year that's the value.

The problem comes in if/when everyone realizes and acknowledges we're in a recession for real, and the market begrudgingly admits that unicorn farts may not be the best valuation method. Then there's a reckoning between the *"oh it'll be okay eventually"* values and the hard numbers each company has actually been reporting.A lot of people use that as an excuse, but I don't agree with that or the bond vs equity parity arguments unless we're talking about concrete impacts like stock buybacks, which in this environment are all but dead except for a few giants with huge cash piles like Apple.How much money have you put on this thesis, and in what way?

I have multiple times my current net worth leveraged on the opposite bet, in a 100% equities portfolio including a decent chunk of options. Do you have your money where your mouth is? What are you short? Or are you just commenting without skin in the game?you can admire whatever you want. multiple vaccines have shown immune response and no severe adverse events in early trials and are in phase 3 already. unless you have a logical response or reason to believe that they are mass producing the vaccines for nothing, i think a sarcastic admiration of presumably unrealistic optimism doesn't belong in an investing sub and you might be investing based on emotion, ignoring the factsI was responding to the “still a pandemic” comment. It is true, but there is light at the end of the tunnel and markets are forward looking. S&P had made tremendous gains before unemployment even got close to normal levels after 2008Well, we just went through an awful market meltdown, and it seems to me most equity index ETFs had few issues meeting redemptions. Spreads widened, of course, so the MM's could cover themselves given the excessive volatility, but that's to be expected. We didn't see any kind of "wholesale meltdown" that saw equity ETFs trading far below NAV. It happened to bond ETFs to a much greater extent, but those underlyings are much more thinly traded and illiquid.It's not that - My understanding of Burry's complaints is that these index funds would cause problems when we run into a rough patch - indiscriminate selling, stocks part of the index being inflated, liquidity etc. We just went through probably the worst market meltdown (in terms of speed and volatility) in recent memory and most ETF's with liquid underlying had no problem maintaining buy/sell spreads - they widened a bit, but hardly all that bad. They had little problem meeting redemptions, so long as they weren't on a naturally illiquid underlying or using some manner of derivative.> The COVID-19 pandemic is the very definition of a black swan event.

Taleb, the very guy who coined the term Black Swan, [literally said that the pandemic is not a Black Swan event.](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-pandemic-isnt-a-black-swan-but-a-portent-of-a-more-fragile-global-system)This is not about me or anyone else particularly. This is about massive media storm which influents people and puts ideas in their, sometimes not really developed, brains. Storm which dictates upcoming doom, meanwhile buying positions foreseeing different outcome.The maths behind it is a bit more than that, but in a way the two listed actually mean the same thing, and the reason for that discrepancy was because of liquidity issues.The persistence in which you are arguing your point makes me think you must work for iShares :)

Yep it’s all fair to say questions around bond pricing vs ETF pricing. Just thought I’d point out that promising daily liquidity in an asset class that is not daily liquid by any stretch of the imagination can have issues. ETFs solve for this by transacting at a price that is either a premium or discount to NAV, but the Fed also stepped in at the exact time needed. If that doesn’t happen, whose to say the discount doesn’t reach even more ridiculous levels, shaking confidence of people on the efficacy of this going forward (the experience this year has actually made many credit ETFs lag benchmarks considerably over long term)? Or in an ETF like BKLN where promising daily liquidity is really laughable (bank loan settlement still takes two weeks!), they actually have legit issues in continuing to exist? 

For what it’s worth, these issues create fantastic opportunities for folks who are aware of the liquidity dynamics right now in the bond market.Illiquid bond ETFs bundle a lot of the illiquid bonds, and the ETF is only as liquid as the most illiquid element. Michael Burry had the right idea about that, and I think it's widely accepted that it would have been catastrophic or at least far more severe if the Feds didn't execute a highly unprecedented move of purchasing bond ETFs directly and injecting liquidity.That number includes the dividend.In that case there’s a bid, it just meets the ask, meaning there’s no spread.Too many readers of Matt Levine out there...

You cannot reverse engineer the individual prices from the basket (ETF price). So it's meaningless to say the ETF price is correct.

It's a nice theory he has there, but it's really not something I'd put much store in. Why? Because the exact same thing was observed across ETFs, in many cases less liquid than the underlying.How can you possibly answer this question without any more details?

You could probably sell those bonds at the ask price that dealers were quoting.Yeah I dont disagree but 401k is the defacto retirement plan for most boomers.I don’t agree. There’s enough money floating around the system to keep this thing propped up until interest rates need hiking. Who knows how long they can kick this can down the road.

A lot of us want another opportunity to get into the market — and that’s exactly why it won’t happen. Markets are definitionally zero sum games — for every winner there is a loser.  The money that controls/influences the market isn’t going to just hand you another bite at the apple — or at least not until you least expect it.... you don’t agree with what? The idea that the discount rate can make huge differences in DCF valuations? Because that’s not really something you can disagree with, DCF valuations are formulaic. Or, are you trying to say you don’t think DCF valuations are meaningful? Because that is something I think has merit as an argument tbhLmfao[deleted]That assumes that these idiots will take the vaccine.While there was a response, we don’t know if it’s sufficient, we don’t know how long it lasts, we don’t know if it affects everybody the same (will older/immunocompromised elicit the same response). Until we get these answers, I’m staying on my fence.

Edit: Just completed Phase 1, not in 3 yet.Taleb did not coin the term Black Swan. It's literally been used for over a millennium.He did? TIL. I stand corrected, then.With all due respect to Mr. taleb, covid-19 seems like a black swan. Outside of a few in the public health arena (nod to bill gates here), nobody last autumn could have imagined what was in store 2020.> This is about massive media storm which influents people and puts ideas in their, sometimes not really developed, brains. Storm which dictates upcoming doom, meanwhile buying positions foreseeing different outcome.

I don't know what news you're looking at, but financial media as well as social media are incredibly bullish and are pushing retail investors, many of them beginners, to invest in stuff like Tesla and Amazon. The only people screaming doom and gloom are the contrarians.So what  Burry warned was index fund and ETF would become disconnected from their NAV.

During March it almost looked like he was right as some bond ETF where trading 15% under their NAV.

However he was wrong because the bond pricing was wrong the spreads were huge so the pricing was just a random guess in the middle. Some BBB rated bond that was priced at $100, however if you held the individual bond you probably couldn't sell for $100 maybe you could sell for $90. $90 was what the bond was "worth" but it was priced at $100.

the ETF was reflecting the real price what was $90, but because the NAV was priced wrong $100 it looked like the ETF was trading below NAV.

To me the ETF pricing reflected the actual value and the NAV of the individual bonds were wrongOk so the bond marked would have crashed if the FED didn't inject liquidity true

Also the ETF that follow the bond market would have crashed because thats what ETF do they follow the underlying assets , if the underlying assets crash, the ETF crashes.

Because the bond market crashed and bond ETF crashed too doesn't prove Blurry right here. If the bond market crashed and ETF didn't that would be more troubling then what happened

Blurry was saying ETF would become disconnected from their NAV that simply didn't happen

yes bonds crashed, guess what ETF following those bonds crash just like they shouldIf you are going to comment on the market you should educate yourself so you stop being such a fucking idiot. If there is no bid, there is no bid. Period. You seem to have never encountered markets in which there is no bid, but let me assure you that they exist. Look at any low delta contracts on underlyings with generally less-liquid options, for example.

If there is no bid, nobody is willing to buy. This is what happens in the depth of market crises and is what the Fed is attempting to avert with liquidity injections and bond buying programs.Yes, but NAV is calculated using last traded price, not ask price or bid price.

Bid prices were way low. And for corporates, a lot of those names weren’t trading for days.

This was not seen in treasury bond etfs, only corporates (and munis?) where the underlying is less liquid.True
>Markets are definitionally zero sum games — for every winner there is a loser.

That's simply not true. Why do you think so?I don't think interest rates down equals equity price up as a universal constant that's true in every environment, especially our current one. I understand how it can be true in some circumstances, or for some specific companies. But that's based on what and how they borrow, on a case by case basis.  

If we're talking about the valuation of the current market I don't think it has anything at all to do with any sort of valuation, including DCF, I think it's running purely on hope and sentiment.

There's no real fear in the finance industry to drag anything down right now because the fed has been backstopping any dangers that appear. 

Look at oil for instance, it's been up nearly 3% in the past couple days on absolutely terrible news, merely because more free money is flowing out of the ECB. Most of the metals commodities are skyrocketing even more than that, with no bad news to pull them down.So that's a "none, I'm just jerking myself off commenting on Reddit"? If so, just say so - no shame in being a commentator instead of an investor. But it is important to distinguish between the two, because there are 10 people willing to prognosticate on the economy for every 1 who is willing to put their money behind their opinions.> Yep, this explains the irrational bull run.

Actually I think the bull run is mostly made on the backs of tech companies that will benefit in the long run from COVID. Even if you’re correct that a vaccine won’t be out for over a year I’d still gladly buy Apple at current prices.

Now what I have a hard time believing is why a large pharma company would be mass producing vaccines in order to have 100,000,000 doses by the end of 2020 if they really should be pessimistic about it passing phase 3 that soon. That sounds like a really expensive mistake.You don’t need to vaccinate everyone, so I am not basing my investment on the assumption that everyone will be vaccinated.> It's literally been used for over a millennium.

But not in the sense that it is used by Taleb (impossible event vs. event not on the radar)If you're talking about the specific year, yes. If we're talking about a pandemic, it was 100% clear there was one coming, just as it is 100% clear that there will be a worse one within the next 100 years.His justification here is that he believes reasonable information predicting the likely scope was available as early as January, but lesser (or no) actions at that time at a more reasonable cost created the costly situation in which we now find ourselves. 



>“Had we used masks then”—in late January—“we could have saved ourselves the stimulus,” Taleb told me.



The article is critical of his position, but that may be partly owing to how Taleb does not exactly mince words in his criticism of journalists (especially financial and economic reporting).If you look on sentiments which were present in may(before we’ve seen decrease of jobless claims) - you will see that most of “analytics” predicted long painful recession spanning for decades. That was in the middle of fed involvement.>To me the ETF pricing reflected the actual value and the NAV of the individual bonds were wrong

This is circular logic. You also have to explain why prior to the liquidity event NAV was equal to ETF pricing.It seems like a lot of people spewing this bullshit have never transacted in illiquid markets and never seen a security for which there is no reasonable bid - or no bid at all.Are you serious? Or being facetious? I didn’t know it was possible not to think they were zero sum. There is always a winning and losing side of a trade — definitionally, both parties cannot win. If you have a stock and you sell it to me for 100 and it goes to 110 then I’ve won and you’ve lost opportunity costs. If it goes to 90 then you got out at the top and I’m holding the bag at 100. 

This is the essence of trading and it’s why you often see buyers and sellers ‘fighting’ over areas of resistance/support.

Not to be snarky, but I’d love to hear a perspective on how markets are non zero sum.> I don't think interest rates down equals equity price up as a universal constant that's true in every environment

The argument is that rates going down, *holding all else equal*, makes the asset worth more because it’s future earnings are discounted less. They don’t have to have borrowed *anything*.

> If we're talking about the valuation of the current market I don't think it has anything at all to do with any sort of valuation, including DCF, I think it's running purely on hope and sentiment.

So this is a separate argument - that equity prices are not based on discounted future cash flows. I’m not sure I agree, I think big tech companies will see huge future cash flows people are realizing now, but it’s entirely separate from the original assertion that rates going lower makes equities more valuable, I mean just by virtue of dividends being less discounted, that is true.LMFAOThe pharma companies are producing to those volumes because the federal governments around the world are fully funding the production, whether the vaccine plays out or nit.

If the 100,000,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine fails testing and gets dumped on the ground, the US government is going to pay for it anyway

You are living in a fucking fantasy and its fucking dangerous to yourself and those around you wake the fuck up and be an adult and responsible citizen. Jesus Christ.Lol okWhat percentage do you think need to be vaccinated to get herd immunity for this specific disease? The numbers I've seen are pretty high for this one.Even in that context it was used centuries before Taleb. He himself will agree he didn't coin it.

He obviously wrote a very nice book applying it to the markets and real world, and popularised the concept. But that's it. He's no authority on what is a black swan. I know that one day mount st. Helen's is going to erupt again or that a major earth quake is going to occur in California. Probably in the next 100 years. If it happens next week, I still want to call it a black swan event.>If you look on sentiments which were present in may(before we’ve seen decrease of jobless claims) - you will see that most of “analytics” predicted long painful recession spanning for decades. That was in the middle of fed involvement.

But the world *is* in the middle of a recession. The stock market =/= the economy.Most "analytics" did not predict a long painful recession spanning **decades**.Because the individual bonds were priced right their NAV wasn't wrong. During march the prices of the individual bonds were wrong or not updating fast enough to reflect realityYour view is not shared by economists who know far more about stock markets than either of us. 

As a thought exercise, say I am a company who needs money to build a new factory. To raise money, I sell you stock for $1M. I use this money to build a factory and expand my business, making it more valuable. The stock is now worth $1.3M.

Which one of us was the winner and which one of us was the loser in this trade?A zero sum game implies that there is never wealth or value created over time. Over time the market expands, buying power increases, and company values increase. We're not all fighting over pieces of a static pie.

In your example, if I'm the seller and take my $100, to start a business, invest in real estate, or reallocate into other securities with a greater than 10% return, does that in turn make the you the looser by missing the opportunity of an 11% return vs a 10%? 

Trading is closer to a zero sum game, but this is r/investing, where IMO it's just not."Zero-sum" does not only require that there is only a winner and losing side to a game, it requires that the total gain equals the total loss (adding up the gains and losses returns a *sum* of *zero*).


Companies' actions that expand/contract their earnings and (especially) being able to return capital to shareholders (through dividends or buybacks) is the reason why this fails to represent a zero-sum game. There are also external factors such as transaction friction and taxes that input to the equation, and a need to account for different timeframes amongst participants (I can 'lose' a trade to you short-term and still come out ahead after holding the position for some time). You have to focus extremely specifically just at the transaction point (ignoring all external factors) to justify a zero-sum assessment. In 1991, William Sharpe (of Sharpe Ratio fame) described a negative-sum case related to active management.



In your example, how can you say that a person who sold lost opportunity cost when they have cash and can freely re-enter the position (or select any other)?As expected, just another stupid child pretending to be an investor.Oh I see you deleted your other profanity-laced comment where you called me a “chartist”. It sounds like you’re angry and making a lot of assumptions about me and my lifestyle based solely on my comments about investing. Maybe you envision me at the grocery store without a mask, yelling at people who ask me to put one on? Either way, your comment is needlessly aggressive and definitely breaks the rules of an investment sub that’s supposed to be for civil discussion.> The numbers I’ve seen

... are likely based on naive interpretations of oversimplified formulas like 1-1/R0, but R0 assumes everyone is equally susceptible. There have been papers which talk about how variations in individual susceptibility can make the herd immunity threshold as low as 20% or lower. Nonetheless even if we assume it is quite high, far more transmissible diseases have been controlled by vaccination campaigns (measles) and so I don’t think there are enough antivaxxers to derail the COVID vaccination campaignI mean even if it’s 80%, anti vaxxers are a (vocal) fringe part of society.

People may be hesitant to try these vaccines because they’re rushed, but way less than 20% of people are antivaxCould you provide just one example from those centuries of use where it is used in this way?I recall from some RealVision interview that there was literally no trading in individual issues, and the prices were simply marked from corp/junk bond ETFs. All the trading was in either trading the index or derivative products. So if anything, the prices reverted to where they probably should be trading. And consequently, FED stepped in and backstopped that process from happening.So lets say if SP500 suddenly traded at 20% lower than the value of the individual shares within the index, then instead of saying there's an issue with liquidity, you'd argue that the individual shares within the index are priced incorrectly?

You do realize your entire argument is circular right?In this case you have a point. But it’s also not what i was referring to; I’m not talking about firms issuing new equity to generate capital. However, in the secondary market (where buyers and sellers are competing against each other) the market is mathematically zero sum.LOLOLOLOLOLI called you a chartist because everything you said indicates that you are a chartist. I deleted it because of the profanity.That's not what the statistics show. 

https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/06/just-50-americans-plan-get-covid-19-vaccine-here-s-how-win-over-restJohn Stuart Mill wrote: "No amount of observations of white swans can allow the inference that all swans are white, but the observation of a single black swan is sufficient to refute that conclusion."If you could actually sell the individual stocks at their "value" then 100% yes it would be an issue with liquidity, but that is not what actually happened with bonds during march.

What happened is some bonds were assigned a price of $100. However if you held the individual bond itself and tried to sell it for $100 you couldn't there were no buyers ; yet that was the offical price used to calculate NAV on the bond funds.OK, we are in a secondary market. I own shares of Tesla and I want to buy a house. I sell you my shares of Tesla and go buy a house. Now it's a year later, and I have a house and you have some shares of Tesla which have appreciated in value. Which one of us is the loser?Ok. I never look at charts, hate anything remotely resembling technical analysis and I don’t know what gave you that idea. But have fun with it> No amount of observations of white swans can allow the inference that all swans are white, but the observation of a single black swan is sufficient to refute that conclusion

That's a philosophical argument from Hume regarding the dangers of using induction to describe laws of nature.>If you could actually sell the individual stocks at their "value" then 100% yes it would be an issue with liquidity, but that is not what actually happened with bonds during march.

Most of the components were indeed able to be redeemed at a much lower credit spread, however the ETF was not able to due to the less liquid elements.The guy who sold you the Tesla shares at a stupid low price for one. 

Look, we can rationalize this a million different ways and assess all the externalities to justify whatever position you want. Reality is that for every winner there is a loser.Yes, that's the same thing as what Taleb talks about. A black swan is an event that has not occurred yet, but has a non-zero probability of occurring.You don't seem open to having your mind changed, so I'll just leave it at:  most people who work or study in this field think you're wrong.Please stop being an idiot. The principle that transactions can occur with mutual benefit is a foundational part of every market, including the secondary equity market.

And I shouldn't even need to tell you this, it's so fucking obvious. If you're going to run your mouth so much about finance, please learn something about it first.

The relative needs of both side of the transaction are not "externalities". They are precisely why mutual benefit is possible: not everyone is looking for the same thing in every transaction.

Here's another good example:

I can invest in a niche market that you can't. I hold a bunch of a stock that has done really well, but I need some capital for an investment in this other market. I sell a bunch of the stock to you, because you can't invest in this new market (whether because you're not accredited, or it's a deal with limited access, or because it's in a foreign country where you can't invest).

This is a mutual benefit for both of us. Neither my position - of having a better option that isn't available to you - nor your position are "externalities".Taleb describes a black swan event as being an outlier (unobserved or very rarely observed) with a large impact (he notes unlike the actual discovery of black swans) that was predictable (and that often gets rationalized ex post facto). He chose this term based on his observation of the way the use of "black swan" in expressions completely changed meanings after they were discovered to actually exist; it was a meta observation (and, I think, him just trying to be witty).


There's nuance to consider between a black swan being used as a metaphor for something unexpected (originally: non-existant) and being used to specifically describe very significant economic events that seem to occur far more frequently than expected (and in consideration of which we should make changes to society and business to be less fragile to their disruption).That’s not a mutual benefit you knob. It’s a pump and dump and you’re a moronThat is *nothing* remotely similar to a pump and dump. You are a fucking imbecile.**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

The fact that leadership at Vanguard think it is a good idea to entrust critical infrastructure with a 3rd party lowest common denominator outsourcing firm is a sign that they are not steering the ship properly. 

Suggestions for where to move funds?Infosys workers are the worst. Nice people, but terrible employees. You get what you pay for.How much outsourcing do the other brokerages do?

I have an IRA with Schwab that I was thinking of moving to Vanguard since my new 401k is over there. But idk, I've heard Vanguard's software isn't the best and this isn't particularly comforting news.Unrelated to this particular news item, I don't really understand the value proposition of Vanguard at this point.  Their platform is limited and dated.  I can buy their funds at other brokerages. Merrill does everything and more and links to BoA accounts.  TDA has ToS and better interface plus futures trading.The best part about Vanguard is it encourages passive investing.....nobody wants to log in and play with that interfaceJust Google Infosys problems. There was a whistle blower issue just last year.

 I am seriously thinking it's time to move out of Vanguard.I moved out of vanguard a while ago because of their outdated UI and no 2FA option that wasn't SMS based. I can't imagine how a huge financial firm still offers SMS based 2fA without realizing how huge of a security flaw it is with sim swapping. At least fidelity and Schwab offer an authenticator-like app with symantec VIP. Vanguard has been behind on the times for a while now and shows no signs of getting with it.

With all of the great brokerage account options out there, there's very little reason to use Vanguard. Don't get me wrong, I love the Vanguard funds, but you can access all of their ETFs in many other platforms. For example, you can literally buy fractional shares of Vanguard ETFs in Fidelity for no extra cost at the same expense ratio as you get in Vanguard. That's something that you can't even do in Vanguard itself!I hope SSN info will not be shared offshore. Most likely \*\*\* -\*\*-\*\*12 will be transparent there.UghhhhhhhhhhThat's not good news. I should transfer my stocks away from them maybe.Oh, hell no. I hope Infosys isn't going to be working on the trading software. KCG lost over 400 million within 45 minutes: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight\_Capital\_Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Capital_Group)

I'm going to have to research how to move my funds to Fidelity, and I recommend you all do the same. If Infosys is touching those critical parts, it's not if but when there's going to be a multi-billion dollar loss day, and class action lawsuits against Vanguard. Infosys are literally bottom of the barrel programmers who couldn't get jobs anywhere else.Glad I just moved over to fidelity. I don't trust this shit nor do I want someone I cannot understand on the phone when I need help. Didn't help that vanguard's platform is dogshit for active traders. Passively it was fine, but fidelity and schwab are much better platforms at least on a technical level.Oh sht. This is where VG go downhill.Uh oh, time to move money out of vanguard.Are there any (tax or otherwise) repercussions if I want to transfer my Roth IRA and brokerage account to something like Fidelity?Time to take money out from my Vanguard accountSo third party, third world people will have access to your social security number and financial data.

There's no possible way THAT could possibly go wrong.This will be awkward.  I get going to cloud services being the smart and efficient move, but outsourcing when most clients are in the USA is a bad idea.  Also Infosys uses AWS infrastructure, so they could have gone to AWS directly.  If not AWS, at least Microsoft Azure.All your funds now belong to ....Was thinking about Vanguard over the weekend. Glad I sat on my hands.Vanguard Client here. Reading these comments? Is it actually this bad guys?We used to use them for EDI integration with utilities.   They were a pain in the ass to work with.Great my 401k is stuck with themThe employees of these companies like Infosys are most of the time obsessed about immigrating to the US. In my opinion, it has a negative effect on their productivity and the quality of work.For someone buying Vanguard funds via Schwab or another broker, would this have any impact at all? 

It does make me question if I want to have too many in funds from a single provider now.*(complains about trading fees and commissions)*

*(fees and commissions get abolished)*

*(complains about expense ratios)*

*(expense ratios get reduced)*

...

*(US workforce replaced with lower-cost Indian workforce to account for reduced revenue)*

*(complains about reliance on cheap foreign labor)*As a developer by profession, I have yet seen a good developer from their house. You know why Boeings are dropping from the sky? It’s because they outsource to garbage consultancies like InfosysThis seems like much ado about nothing. Okay, Vanguard is moving jobs to Infosys. That’s a win for Infosys and a win for Vanguard. Vanguard gets to eliminate a portion of their expenses while offloading some of their tasks. Infosys gains a new revenue stream. 

I’m missing the reason why folks are getting upset. No jobs have been eliminated (yet), and even if they were going to eliminate jobs, they’ve provided plenty of warning so if you work there and want to get out, you could start looking today. 

For those that have employer sponsored plans through Vanguard, your contributions will continue to look and feel the same.

Nothing is changing from the Vanguard platform perspective; that is, you’ll still be able to buy and hold securities like you do today. You’ll also be able to trade derivatives, just like you do today. Your tax documents will arrive just like they’ve arrived every year. So again I ask, what’s the problem?[deleted]ACATS'd my accounts to Fidelity awhile ago, Vanguard's tech story is a shitshow. Lots of inertia, no motivation to improve, they're an old financial services firm who doesn't comprehend that tech is the differentiator now (and they'll just outsource it to Infosys).

Expense ratios are so low across the board for non-actively managed funds, it makes no sense to be at Vanguard anymore. I keep Schwab for investment income management and a checking account that reimburses ATM fees globally, Fidelity for tax advantaged accounts, 529, etc (their cash management account is good as well, but only domestic ATM fee reimbursement).

Disclosure: I work in financial services, but not for any of the orgs mentioned in this comment.Of course it will. Infosys is terrible if you expect them to do work that requires actual thought. I've seen 50 person infosys teams barely deliver the minimum requirements of a very simple project that could have easily been done with 2 people better. 

Anyone they send to you that's good gets pulled off eventually and replaced with a 'senior resource' remotely that is super green, and they don't even properly train each other themselves.Fidelity or Charles Schwab.  Both are great choices, but Fidelity has free Index mutual funds and fractional share purchasing ability for all stocks and ETFs.  Schwab has great travel perks and slightly better customer service.This is common in the IT space and has happened forever. Non-technical suits see outsourcing tech as an easy way to save money, so they outsource it all to India, then when sh\*t starts hitting the fan and breaking they try to fix it with bandaids and the infrastructure limps along until eventually they insource everything back to the US. Then another group of non-technical suits sees outsourcing tech as an easy way to save money....It's funny. I was just noticing how much more complete Vanguard's annual reports were circa 2014 than this year's equivalent report, for some of my funds.

But hey! Who cares what the "yield to maturity" on a bond fund is. That sounds like a boring detail. Let's just omit that. Or worse, are they omitting numbers that don't look so great? Like, just give me the numbers guys...I think Schwab is a good choice. I've delt with their customer service and I was happy with it (their customer service center is first party and based in Texas I believe).It's so frightening that the people in charge genuinely think this is a good idea. Very clear how wildly out of touch they are. They will lose many customers over this.Google uses Infosys, Wipro, Deloitte, others too. Are you deleting GMail account too?every company outsources.  half of the engineers at google are contractorsThere are many other companies across different domains who outsource their infra, support and operations. Most likely firms like TCS, Infosys, Wipro gets that work. It shouldnt really matter to the end user as who is running the operations, as long as system stay stable and perform as expected. Companies saves a lot of money doing that.I will take that you have not worked with TCS employeesVanguard's website is absolutely horrible compared to Schwab if you are looking for tools to help you trade. 

However, it doesn't make a difference to me, because my IRA is just index funds that I throw money into and hold for the long term. It's totally fine for buy and hold, but people who are constantly trading (which they probably shouldn't be doing in the first place) would probably see Vanguard as inadequate. 

I would also personally rather use Vanguard's shitty interface with a lack of tools because it helps me stay grounded and avoid making those sorts of day trades that others might make during volatile times, especially with the advent of free trades and low/no fees across the board as brokerages compete. In my thinking, a Jack Bogle book is far better than Schwab's trading tools.Most young people's retirement investments are with Fidelity, Charles Schwab, or M1 Finance nowadays.  

M1 finance does automatic rebalancing and has low cost ETFs that can be bought using fractional shares.Lol so true. At this point it's where my automated monthly contributions to VTSAX go. Very much 😴😴😴 

Everything else goes elsewhere, especially after this shit show.I think they’ve realized that they have an outdated UI as they’re slowly rolling out incremental updates. It’s still jarring to switch between the two interface versions though.HaHaHa, PI will be compromised.I don't think Infosys will be taking over the trading software, at least not yet.  My read is that Infosys is taking over the maintenance and development of the processes underpinning the 401k (and other defined contribution) plans.  The contributions get (automatically) put into Vanguard funds, which would be invested into the market using software that Vanguard currently uses.

That is to say, if you have a 401k or other DC plan with Vanguard, this news affects you most directly.Indian here. Companies like Infosys really are as bad as people here say. I wrote a post a while ago mentioning exactly why I don't invest in Indian IT companies despite them making a bank.

It's very much relevant here. https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/hd7j22/why_i_dont_invest_in_it_companies_censored_from

These really are the worst engineers you can find in India as well. It's unfortunate really that these folks are the ones most western people are exposed to and end up giving a bad name to the rest of us.

Judge the person you're working with, not the entire nation. Just keep that in mind and it'd help you get a better understanding of things. I see people here hating on Indian engineers as a whole and that's unfortunate because not all Indian engineers work for infosys. The ones who can't get a job anywhere else do.

Infosys are the pioneers of Garbage in, Garbage out. Boomer managers keep falling for them though.It's very easy I just did it. Literally just put in the account number and some other small details. It only took like 3-4 days to move over. No fees whatsoever moving out, although if there were fidelity would have credited them.No, as long as you do the transfer properly (don't withdraw the funds yourself). The broker you are transferring to handles it. I moved a roth IRA from Vanguard to TDA awhile back with no issues. You just have to supply the account info to the new brokerage and initiate the transfer process.

Edit: this may result in liquidating your current holdings to a settlement fund if the target brokerage doesn't offer the funds you're currently invested in. In which case you can rebuy into whatever you want after the transfer.Same question.[removed]Fidelity has thousands of people working for them and through Infosys in India for many years. Clearly there’s no issues.Third world people?  WtfAWS don't actually do the large scale cloud transformations for you, that's why you have vendors who would come in and help you journey to the cloud.I work at Vanguard. 99% of the people here have no idea what they’re talking about.Leave. This is going to blow up terriblyIt's just back end mechanics related to defined contribution plans.  My guess is if you didn't see this post  you'd never notice a change. 

But outsourcing is a buzzword on reddit so people are gonna sensationalize.Yes, get out.Corrected it for you

(US workforce replaced with lower-cost incompetent Indian workforce to account for reduced revenue)Security, mostly. Outsourcing to India your especially large 401K funds is scary. Outsourcing is done for cost, so you'd expect worse programmers to work on it. Just being dangerous with something you shouldn't be dangerous with.Yeah jobs are growing on trees these days.I agree with stacking libraries, its the plumbing we're worried about. Someone that knows how to plumb things together without leaks and done right every time is hard to find both in actual plumbing, and in software.> Vanguard's tech story is a shitshow. Lots of inertia, no motivation to improve, they're an old financial services firm who doesn't comprehend that tech is the differentiator now (and they'll just outsource it to Infosys).

This is the worst way to outsource to Infosys. If they are not told exactly what to do and how to do it and left on their own, they'll milk them and deliver very little. Outsourcing only works if you have a strong tech team that has mature processes where you want to outsource mundane $#!+ work, not when you want them to build that for you (they won't).I also feel that Vanguard has lost its edge. Being the originator of the low cost index fund made them a shit ton of money. That plus the fact that its owned by the funds itself. However, they no longer have that competitive edge or (RIP) Jack. Personally I think newer money is going to flow towards Fid, Sch, or even Robinhood.Fidelity is not particularly stellar in terms of technology eitherYa outsourcing sucks because any semi competent indian is already working in the us on an h1b1Schwab also has fractional share purchasing ability now. Also, both brokerages have physical branches throughout the US.Does anyone know if any of these services let you group stocks together? For example id like to group all the REITs together and growth stocks in another group etc.  And then see how much is in each group and how each has performed.what are their travel perks?Schwab outsourced it another Indian company a long time backI know. I get paid to clean this stuff up.It's surprising to see them do this now. After so many big failures, it felt like outsourcing, at least the main parts, of software development was all but over. There's definitely less companies doing it. It simply does not work well and this will end badly for Vanguard.See: Boeing 737 MaxLmao, I worked for an accounting firm that did this, they outsourced some tax and auditing procedures to an Indian company and most of the time we ended up fixing the work. Sometimes there's staff there that will just hide rows and columns in excel hoping we wouldn't see any errors and just sign off on their work. Even more idiotic, some of the work was outsource work were doing in-house for another corporation that decided to fire their accountants and pay us to do it instead....which was outsourced to India by us. Needless to say our clients didn't like that work.I can't tell you how many times this has happened (im in IT). These decisions are ALWAYS made by executives that dont understand technology. They see $ bottom line....sad. boomer decisions.Exactly. IBM does this every 5 years or soThis is what killed IBM.This is a common problem in consulting engineering too.Currently working on a project for one of the big firms. 35 or so people on the project. All but a handful are H1-B. Anything to lower cost.Come on haha Deloitte is on a whole another level than Infosys and Wipro. And I say that working at Capgemini (onshore) which is in between Deloitte and Infosys/WiproI use DuckDuck Go for search engine and Brave browser, looking an alternative email> every company outsources

This is my favorite story about outsourcing.  It involves UCSF medicine.  Physicians record their verbal notes and those recordings need to be transcribed to text:

> For two decades, UCSF has outsourced a portion of its transcription work to Transcription Stat. Kim Kaneko, the owner of the Sausalito firm, said she maintains a network of 15 subcontractors throughout the country to handle the "hundreds of files a day" received by her office.
> 
> One of those subcontractors is a Florida woman named Sonya Newburn, whom Kaneko said she'd been using steadily for about a year and a half. Kaneko knew that Newburn herself used subcontractors but assumed that was as far as it went.
> 
> What Kaneko said she didn't know is that one of Newburn's transcribers, a Texas man named Tom Spires, had his own network of subcontractors. One of these, apparently, was a Pakistani woman named Lubna Baloch.
> 
> On Oct. 7, UCSF officials received an e-mail from Baloch, who described herself as "a medical doctor by profession." She said Spires owed her money and had cut off all communication. Baloch demanded that UCSF find Spires and remedy the situation.
> 
> She wrote: "Your patient records are out in the open to be exposed, so you better track that person and make him pay my dues or otherwise I will expose all the voice files and patient records of UCSF Parnassus and Mt. Zion campuses on the Internet."

From https://www.sfgate.com/health/article/A-tough-lesson-on-medical-privacy-Pakistani-2552427.phpIndividual engineers. They are not outsourcing entire divisions to off-shore code farms with little to no supervision. There is a big difference. 

Do you want to live in the house built by master craftsmen and their apprentices, or do you want to live in the house built by nothing but apprentices, who also are in a totally different timezone and difficult to understand?I find it hard to believe that google outsources more than 50% of engineers. I can’t find a source. It seems the number is much, much lower.> as long as system stay stable and perform as expected

That's the problem. A big part of my job is fixing the issues outsourced companies create; especially from India. The culture over there is to promise the world, and do whatever it takes to keep that promise (usually at the cost of quality, and security). They will usually deliver on time, but what gets delivered is riddled with bugs (some very serious). This has been my experience working with outsourced developers from that region, from multiple places.

Usually, the developers from these places are plucked straight out of school or bootcamps. The ones that are _actually_ good at it move on to other places that pay competitively. The only ones that stay are the ones that aren't so great at it.

Knowing what I know, its hard for me to feel comfortable trusting my life savings in the hands of sub-par developers who will do anything to serve a deadline. "You get what you pay for in life" comes to mind.Well said!Even buy and hold investors should be rebalancing as their risk tolerance changes. 

Unless you are 100% VT, you are active investing.Yeah, the shitty interface is why I moved back to vanguard from Schwab. Lost 40k in March due to panicCrap I just opened up a Vanguard IRA as a first time investor. Thankfully its for index funds but maybe i should transfer my funds to Sch 🙄M1 Fiance is my go to. Easy to setup and they are growing like crazy. Fractional shares on anything really wins over all these "slices" or only ETFs nonsense. 

Support is lacking but I've always had success.Whatever they're doing, they're just making the UI worse.  Oddly the app is really fantastic.That's good to hear. I'll be auditing my statements more closely now for sure.Yeah, I work with plenty of Indian engineers at a FAANG, and they're awesome, really talented people. I differentiate them from those who work at WITCH bodyshops. I would have no problem with an Indian team at Amazon or Microsoft working on Vanguard cloud migration, but Infosys...Wouldn’t you have capital gains if goes into a settlement fund. For example, do my shares of AAPL just go through without selling, but something like VTSAX has to go into a settlement to be bought into a Fidelity equivalent?Nothing to do with race, everything to do with foreign nationals and data security.Where have you observed this "companies making people feel racist" bit? It's always either "we need to cut costs to stay competitive", "it's due to the economy" (even if the economy is booming), or management just doesn't care enough what anyone else thinks to bother making something up.Fidelity's customer service is local.  Also many of the features Fidelity uses are from Google Cloud now.  More of an H1-B visa population that is managed locally than 100% outsourced.So who is an alternative that doesn’t outsource like this?Yeah OK bud.

Selling Fidelity as well.Yup figured as much.  This sub is full of morons.Right, but are you saying they’re going to be completely negligent with their data handling and practices surrounding which teams and who get access to sensitive information like SSNs? 

It sounds like folks are making a bunch of assumptions here without any evidence to say that things will be done poorly. We partner with India and other countries and handle very sensitive data (PII, PHI, etc.). Our outsourced teams don’t have access to most of it. The data is masked and scrubbed with identifiers being removed. Strict access control pattens and protocols are followed. That’s why I’m skeptical that Vanguard is just going to let Infosys operate in a manner which doesn’t have full traceability. 

Additionally, since they’re talking about going into the cloud, the data architecture is going to need to be audited by a third party if that’s where they are storing it.In engineering and software (+ related tracks ... Project managers, Scrum masters, BSAs, etc.), they pretty much are. Not trying to be a jackal at all, but I personally know of plenty of new jobs that have been created since this started. We even opened up 30 jobs on our group that pay a minimum of $100,000/year. It entirely depends on your field. For jobs that don't require specialized skills, I would entirely agree with your sentiment and state that there are many jobs being eliminated from the economy.Lol @ robinhoodI think its just fine.Different strokes. I think their app and website are the tits compared to Vanguard and other brokerages.This right here. Also Schwab's customer service is 100% US based, which I love after transferring from RH.

Most of my family swears by Vanguard, but I always find a company with good service first since money is our most important asset.M1 Finance does.

The hard part is figuring out the weighted allocation.A debt card with atm fee reimbursement world wide and no foreign exchange fees.  Also a premium travel credit card with CS Amex Platinum.Last I heard was that they were moving to Texas and using Google cloud services.  Some of Google employees are H1-B employees, but they are still managed locally.

Also as mentioned above, the customer service is 100% US based.I want some horror stories.

(I work in IT myself).How much money are they saving from outsourcing and then paying someone like you?How is that related to outsourcing in any way?Deloitte Audit is pretty much run out of india these daysProtonMailmailbox.orgFastMailCheap and easy never turns out well.ah i see, i missed that about the original article how infosys would actually be controlling the projectsahh, i was referring to this article https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/technology/google-temp-workers.html#:~:text=As%20of%20March%2C%20Google%20worked,by%20The%20New%20York%20Times. but it mentions all workers, not just engineers.  i don't see a number on engineers specificallyIrony is the same out of school recruits files for H1B and are sent through same companies doing the same work. Unfortunately the cycle repeats.I agree with the post above. I have both vanguard and Schwab. Vanguard's online site is quite garbage. Schwab's is far better.

Vanguard lack of utility in their website is good to keep you focused on just throwing money to the retirement fund. They like to resolve things by phone, which makes me worry if I'm talking to a near incomprehensible Indian person.

Schwab's is just as good product wise, they have funds that match most of vanguard. Their only downside is that their fund expense fees is still slightly higher compared to vanguard admiral funds. But trust me when I say, this tiny difference is TINY.

Overall I don't think I can move out of vanguard as Schwab does not provide a solo i401k option (Roth IRA). 

If you are capable, then open both accounts and get your own feel for them. Really the only way to know what you prefer.Yeah, if it's in taxable you would incur LTCG/STCG if something had to be liquidated. Look into ACATS system. You'll most likely be able to xfer the whole portfolio without realizing a taxable event.That’s true. The customer service is local. I was mostly commenting on the OP implying that third world back office employees who have access to personal data is more dangerous than Americans having that data.Not sure. Some google searches would probably give you that info. If I had to guess it’s the smaller brokerages like robinhood, M1 Finance, etc.There def aren’t any. There is a reason why they outsourceI agree, it's just a bad signal. If it requires a bunch of hoops and regulations, often there is not much to be gained.Not in this instance. It looks like they eliminated an entire branch of their company from the top on down, including specialized positions.Hopefully no one is trying to outsource those positions in your company. Lots of laid off people looking, including those in software, engineering etc. Wasn’t Infosys the company behind the outsourcing of Verizon’s IT employees last year? It seems like any job that can be done remotely can be outsourced to someone cheaper if the company wants to save some money.it will not stop at robinhood though, it keeps flowing through it to the hedgefunds and option traders.Also once TD Ameritrade is integrated with Schwab, that will make Schwab very attractive from a tech view assuming they keep think or swimM1.is stupid you can't buy at your allocation without manually doing itz say if you're overweight somewhere

What I mean is let's say you have an allocation of 10 sticks at 10%>> one stock drops 20% but you believe in it, so you buy up more of that stock and now it's actually 15% of your portfolio.

I'd you buy your pie it will only buy all the other stocks. I get it tries to rebalancy by buying, but should be an option to just buy at your allocation or buy towards your balance 

Folio gives you more flexibility but man they are super old and if you deposit money the wrong way it's stuck for 4 months before you can withdraw..

M1 has good visualization sort of .You don't need to have any money in the brokerage account to have the debit card fyi.I have the fee free card already.I used to live in Austin and knew some of Schwab's tech people there. They're one of the top employers in the area.That may be but in my experience the quality of their customer service dropped a lot about 3 years ago. It's still good, but not what it used to be, their people seem a lot less trained. They're still good, but they used to be great.r/talesfromtechsupportIt's a negative amount. I've had to fix up crap outsourced CAD or FEA before and usually I end up having to spend so much time figuring out what was done and attempting to fix it that I could have done it from scratch just as fast.H1-B visas mean sourcing work from other countries, also called outsourcing.USI is immense and serves not only Deloitte US but also offices in Europe, Canada and Australia.I used proton but i got a lot of phishing emails, do you get those?Yeah i only have roth IRA so far. Going to be independent contractor 1099, so no 401k through my employer. Probably open up solo 401k but still don’t know enoughThanks!Are you implying it ISNT? I have a bridge to sell you if so!That makes sense. Par for the course then.That’s fair. Thank you for your comment.Sounds like you're working too fast and hard. Slow down.H1B doesn't mean outsourcing.I also did basically immediately, before I could even give out my address anywhere. Their spam filter has gotten a little bit better but it's still not great.none at all. I actually got the paid subscription now. But no phishing emails everVanguard is a simple to follow process and you should definitely open one.

Solo i401k is post tax and limit is 19.5k. best way to save and not worry about any tax at 59.5 years old.

Coupled this with a Roth IRA, you are banking 25k per year at least. Assuming you can save that much, try your best to.Out of curiosity, do you work in IT?I appreciate all of your help!!Nope**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*So are we headed to a "massive acceleration of money and credit, inflation, oil and commodity prices"?Did Ray Dalio ever address the possibility that the Fed would buy stocks and corporate bonds?

It seems that a lot of his theories fail due to this seemingly unprecedented (and some would say illegal) action by the Fed. But is it truly unprecedented and if not what are the best historical analogies? Perhaps the closest analogy I can think of is in socialist countries that have nationalized their failing industries.It's kind of obvious that more money in the system will lead to inflation of *some* kind: goods and services and/or assets. Fed's action make it clear that holding cash (except for six months of expenses) is stupid. The price of cash-rich equities, real estate, and gold will shoot up in the coming years.If anyone wants to go down a rabbit hole take a look at the articles by this guy [Jeffrey Snider](https://twitter.com/JeffSnider_AIP?s=21). According to him there is no threat of inflation at all, in fact what we should be worrying about is massive deflation as there is currently a worldwide dollar shortage. I really don’t have the knowledge to comment on whether he’s right or Ray Dalio is right, but it is interesting to see how much his opinions contrast with the majority who thinks we’ll soon see runaway inflation.But at the end of the cycle does the new order have to be some other country coming to power?  Maybe the US already went through this cycle with the great depression followed by the new deal.  Every election is an opportunity for revolution.Is he basing this on the last century? If so, that doesn't seem to provide enough data points. How many true world superpowers have there been in history? I think some of this is genius, and some of it is weird political mumbo-jumbo: primarily the parts about a "new world order." Bleh.Totally unrelated question, anybody know how pure alpha and the all weather fund are performing lately? Also how many times has Dalio called for the end of the long-term debt cycle?And to think if we just taxed the rich during the good times and paid for infrastructure projects that employ the masses during the bad times, things would mostly go fine. 

But no, there must be growth no matter how artificial.It’s all indisputable... just doesn’t happen overnightWhat emerging power can replace the US though? I cannot see a realistic competitor for decades. This has been discussed on the sub at length many times. The EU nor China are anywhere close to taking the reigns from the US.Funny enough I'm reading principles right now. Are these chapters that are online going to be included in the book he's got coming out in November?Remindme 5 monthsWhich letter are we at now? F - Printing lots of money? Or are we at C - central banks lowering interest rates and providing more credit?Gold has a higher volatility than US stocks for a slightly worse return over the last 50 years.  Additionally it doesn't even hedge well against inflation in normal times; it was a very poor hedge between 1981 and 2002 and again from 2012 to 2018.  Pretty sure we had inflation during those periods.

It seems like its OK during times of unexpected/higher-than-expected inflation or anticipation of it.  I find it hard to square this with the fact that the 10-year TIPS yield just seems to be decreasing steadily.His thoughts are really good,

The situation was never be more clear than today, it will help the smart investor to make more and more money.

And others will see some spike in their portfolios and then lasting death.

Good luck.I really love his perspective on the 1000 ft macro picture. It is interesting to see things playing out now with the central bank moving to both monetary stimulus and supporting fiscal stimulus through asset purchases. This is leading to (yet again) unprecedented measures. For now, there will be a deflationary effect from the residual of the coronavirus damage and change in consumer behavior, but it could only be a matter of time before the fed backed fiscal stimulus will create an inflationary environment (not to mention the rising protectionist measures adopted by developed countries). 

With the adoption of MMT, the focus of fed is placed on employment + redistribution of wealth since it recognizes that the mechanics behind inflation and unemployment / monetary action are much more complicated than traditional economic theory would suggest. It defines the government as a currency issuer and not a currency user, which gives it a free pass to print print print to support full employment regardless of what the deficit is. Given wealth inequality, rise of populism and the economic recession we are facing, I can easily see this new mentality being adopted by more politicians since it is politically untenable to reduce government spending while people are suffering and become used to the aid in name of correcting wealth inequality. Like the old adage goes, there is nothing so permanent as a  temporary government solution. 

I wonder how long the consequences Dalio talks about will take to play out and what are some markers. I also wonder if MMT is going to just be a story within the "cycle" and another debunked theory through time, or if it will actually work to counteract this trend/prolong it.Yes, buy his fonds and you will be fine.I thought the western world was shunning Chinese Propaganda these days...why do we discuss Dalio?  He is an arm of the CCP.  Nothing he says is earnest.>(i.e., the cheaper money and credit are, the more expensive asset prices are) 

doesn't line up at all with what is happening in the market right now?

I see a lot of value stocks, heavy in assets, that are stuck at valuations below the pre-corona highs. The stocks with low price-book ratios.

Meanwhile you see the opposite with stocks that involve very few assets and a high price-book ratio, sky-rocketing.Yep. He said in a recent interview asset prices don't matter.  P/E doesn't matter.  Printing will keep going because it can't stop.What you say is correct and he did address it in this chapter. These are just some handpicked quotes that I found interesting. You should definitely read full chapter.Is the Fed buying stocks yet though? The only thing I could find is this article which talks about the Fed might buy stocks at some point in the future: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevincoldiron/2020/07/18/the-fed-is-going-to-buy-stocks/#4e846520eb49](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevincoldiron/2020/07/18/the-fed-is-going-to-buy-stocks/#4e846520eb49)  


This could be wrong, so please share information if you have it. Thank you![deleted]He refers to this as Monetary Policy 3, or MP3.Definitely will have a look. Thanks.Ted spread came down; the dollar shortsqueeze is barely there. Dollar devaluation vs other currencies are proof. Inflation is comingDalio is talking longer term. That the devaluation of the Dollar will be the paradigm of this decade. Just as QE driving leveraged assets (stocks, real estate) up, and as such the expected returns down, was the paradigm of the last decade. He also agrees that the money printing would not necessarily be inflationary as it's offsetting deflation, just cause a currency depreciation relative to gold and longer term lead to an end of the USD as the Reserve Currency.

 He's not helping any of us time the market. You can see AMA's where he talked about a potential short term deflationary force, but either the Fed will make it whole by printing, people will default, or some combination of the 2. In the end, the Dollar denominated debt will be restructured. Longer term, if money is being printed and interest rates are effectively 0, I think his thesis that people will not want to own those bonds is correct. The 60/40 portfolio is not as safe as it has been in past decades basically. And you want to own some gold to hedge that.

Edit: They could be wrong, but when it comes to interpreting the Macro Environment, I'm of the view that Bridgewater is the best fund in the World. I'd take what he says seriously in terms of a long term strategic asset allocation. I think Dalio is biased on China because he has interests there and won't criticize them directly, but his thesis that there will be a restructuring of the Dollar is accurate. And what happens after that happens remains to be seen.This seems like the biggest hole in the theory. It implies we're heading towards a war, which after the winner will emerge as the new order. In todays climate, that would obviously be China and friends vs the US and friends. But as much power as China does have, they could absolutely not win that war especially being bordered by other legitimate powers such as India, South Korea and Japan that would side with the US. I suppose one of the US's allies could take the power (India comes to mind as a possibility) but in any war the US is obviously going to be the powerhouse.He did analyse dominant world empires over the last 500 year. You can read about it here: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/big-cycles-over-last-500-years-ray-dalio/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/big-cycles-over-last-500-years-ray-dalio/) 

To simplify, the history has shown that a nation becomes world power, over time becomes more hedonistic until rival nation appears and takes over. As far as I remember it went from Netherlands to Britain to America. Over the lifetime of empire, however, there are many economic cycles that happens within its economy.Correct, no one is for a few decades at least.You should read previous chapters. He analysed major empires in the last 500 years but this chapter is focused on US. Really interesting analysis!

New world order doesn't mean illuminati or some other stupid shit. It just means that one empire is the strongest and is on top for a while. So the old world order in this context is that the British Empire was the strongest world power and GBP was the world reserve currency. After WW2 new world order emerged. British Empire vaned and US became the dominant power and USD became world reserve currency.So there are normal economic cycles like we had 1999 and then it went bust and then there was bull run and it got to 2007 and it went bust again and so on and so forth.  And we have long therm cycle which lasts for few hundred years and at the end of it there is new world power and new world currency. Like GBP to USD. Nobody go on the news and says long term cycle is over every few years. However, speaking of short term cycles, in 2008 he accurately predicted  short term cycle and made massive gains. While everyone lost money his fund made like +20% or something like that. On the other hand, his alpha fund did not perform very well this time and he did admit he missed opportunities. Having that said it still performed well and its not like it lost 30% in value or anything like that. All weather if different thing and you can backtest it yourself.This is why Trump’s calls for negative interest rates, tax cuts, and running record deficits during a period of very low unemployment and decent growth scared me so much. Anyone with a brain knew this would leave us without ammunition during the bad times and now the bad times are here.Right? I’m thinking about those tax cuts the president pushed so hard for that were passed in 2017 when the economy was doing well.I think its separate.Also reading principles right now, what do you think? I find myself nodding along to most of his ideas.That’s an obviously silly statement?? Stocks are all considered assets, and there are always under/over performers. 

This statement perfectly reflects the current scenario: 

* Dollar weakening
* Fed interest rates at zero, credit easily available
* Stock prices mooning back to all time highs amidst a massive recession

Election would bring the change in tax structure to redistribute wealth, then war with China to follow and then cycle is complete. To me, a totally reasonable scenario he describes.In that case, dollar cash is trash and we should all stockpile on gold. 

Seems easy, but I suspect that there are issues with this statement. 

Educate me?Then why is inflation projected to be sub 1% this year and has been sub 3% since like 2008?I’m really interested to see how he resolves this current episode in his *Big Debt Cycle* theory. We seem to have completely skipped multiple steps in his debt cycle but perhaps it’s too early to tell. We may just be in a bull trap and equity prices will actually drop and deleveraging will occur as he predicts and then the debt cycle will be complete.The Fed isn’t buying stocks and doesn’t plan to.Yes sorry, the Fed is not buying stocks, just bonds and bond ETFs.It has to be tested in court for it to be illegal in a common law system. Since this action by the Fed is unprecedented we actually don’t know if it is legal. But for the sake of discussion, let’s say it was illegal.

It was illegal because the Federal Reserve Act does not allow the Fed to purchase ~~stocks~~ ~~and~~ corporate bonds. The Fed thinks it found a workaround by having the Treasury provide collateral. However, if the ~~stocks~~ ~~and~~ bonds lose more than 10% of their value, it’s not clear who is on the hook. I don’t think the Fed would be able to foot the bill so the Treasury must be taking all of the liability. So this is central banking not by the Fed but actually by the Treasury (with the Fed’s blessing).

The whole reason the Federal Reserve Act was signed into law was to prevent the central bank (which was the Treasury at the time) from being influenced by politics. They created the Fed specifically so the incumbent politicians would not go on spending sprees right before elections to stay in power. This action by the Fed is not only illegal by the letter of the law but also in the spirit of the law because this is the exact scenario that the Fed is supposed to prevent.Yes I believe this. Thing is, dollar devaluation is what the current administration always wanted and will be good for US businesses and their exports. Now Europe is going to start printing 1800 trillion euros to help the European Union's economies so it might start to level off again.He doesn't say that events will necessarily transpire into a hot war although historically that has often been the case when there's a rising power. The US was able to supplant the UK as hegemon and also 'defeated' the Soviet Union without a hot war. He's just pointed out a historical tendency to conflict which can take many forms e.g. economic war and possibly military conflictIndia would need to have such massive unprecedented growth to reach that level.

They are not a first world country still. It’s quite a leap to go from that to dominant power. Actually seems downright impossible.I don't think war with China will be a troops on the ground or drones in the air kind of war. That's now how China plays. They play not with might, but by "cheating". China will defeat us by defeating our economy and government though espionage, stealing trade secrets, manipulating the supply chain, inciting riots, owning land in other countries (for mineral rights, rentals), etc... just like how they have several South American and African countries under their thumb through the belt and road program. Those countries have Chinese infrastructure and Chinese workers, and owe China for the privilege. They owe so much money and they are so poor, they pay China with commodities like oil. 

We are in an age where you don't win by collecting body counts or physical prisoners at gun point. Today, you win through controlling the system that controls these people.India?  Very likely not a possibility, not for several generations at least.  Not sure if you've been but things there 'just don't work' like they do in developed countries.  Requires a massive change in DNA at the core.I would actually argue that it went Netherlands, Britain, Austria, America.I think democracy is a game changer for this.  The rival nation can just be the Yang Gang political/cultural takeover.  When have we had a dominant democracy before?Who's next? China? India?Thanks for responding so reasonably. I definitely want to read his books now. I must admit that I learned a ton by watching his "economic machine" video about boom and bust cycles in the economy; the man definitely knows some things.

Doesn't mean I'd make him supreme ruler of the world, but would like to know more of his thoughts on the economy, even some I may disagree with (or predictions I agree will happen but think are bad, which he may think are good)

There are a lot of politics tied into these types of discussions, especially when predicting the futures of different sectors of the economy. Some people say X industry is leaving America, then that group is split into those who think this is good and those who think this is bad. Generally, it's a bad thing when your economy becomes too reliant on a handful of industries, especially ones that don't supply you with your most critical goods.

Medicine and drugs, for example, are pretty important. Having antibiotics made overseas is risky because in supply chain problems or international conflict, your people are going to have a bigger hurdle getting the medicine they need. Just an example.

Thus, predicting the demise of the US as supreme power could be accurate, but it could be a very bad thing for the world and something we should be actively fighting to prevent.

It could also prove a very inaccurate prediction. 

Regardless, we should all want the world's superpowers to be countries with strong respect for civil liberties, personal freedoms, privacy, security, property, etc. Never a dictatorship or totalitarian society. Even if that becomes more profitable to some.There is no way the RMB will become the world's reserve currency.Look I like ray Dalio, but he said the long-term debt cycle happens when the fed hits the lower bound, that happened in 2008 and he made that prediction and he did it again this time around. The concept you have to understand here is the us’s status as a reserve currency and the ability that gives the fed to increase credit. Pure Alpha hasn’t generated alpha in 10 years. All weather is down big this year as well. Again he has a lot of interesting points but I think makes the mistake of extrapolating too much from history.I'm enjoying it so far. It's made me reevaluate a lot of the ways my own mind works and thinks.

I'm just about to start chapter 4 of the life portion (out of 5 or 6 chapters I think?) Then moving onto the work one.Totally silly.  He is completely neutral in his criticism of chinese debt bubbles.  Furthermore, his current dialogue on chinese capital controls and the nationalization of banks and insurance companies in the last week was illuminating.  

The time period he uses to make his point is unbiased and not slanted towards the modern chinese form of government.  Most importantly, his balanced view of the Chinese problems with fresh water and domestic food security is world class.

/sHis point is that it seems to be the "ownership" if you will of assets increasing, rather than the underlying assets increasing.

For example, an asset light consulting company may be seeing is rise, but a holding company is missing on this inflation as its assets are behind a second "layer" of ownership if you will, even though if inflation is occurring the holding (i.e BIP.UN) company's assets should also be increasing.cash is absolutely trash.

people dont understand gold at all. they think its just some shiny metal thats always been valuable but has no purpose in modern society. that is wrong. gold is simply a better store of value than the dollar. it is better than the dollar at storing wealth.

remember though - gold is really a base layer currency a la the dollar or the euro. you arent investing in a company, you're  choosing to store your savings in a currency with better store of value  properties than the dollar. in this way - gold should be thought of more as an alternative to keeping money in a savings account as opposed to being someones investment portfolio.

and just as an example - one thing people like to point to today is how college tuition has skyrocketed over the last 50 years. but look at the below chart: if you price the tuition of yale in grams of gold, tuition is actually cheaper now than it was in 1960.

invest in stocks and real estate. save in gold.This is what im doing. We printed 3 trillion with another trillion seemingly on its way. I loaded up in March and have seen 20-150% return so far. I dont think we will ever go back to a gold standard in my lifetime but gold popped after the last two recessions. Also the gold silver ratio is off balance atm so silver has even more room to rungold drops just the same as stocks, it is a commodity used in industry.  Its commonly referred to as a hedge against inflation but thats not even true. The sp500 is a better one. The only time gold would be valuable is if the entire system collapses, goes through a long drawn out dark age, then begins to rebuild.  Guns ammo and food would be much more valuable until that time.I \*know\* I'm gonna get trashed, but please also consider Bitcoin. It has all the properties of Gold, but better. Great thread about it (readable in 30 sec):  
[https://twitter.com/QWQiao/status/1285740364851220485](https://twitter.com/QWQiao/status/1285740364851220485)

And if (if) Bitcoin goes where it's supposed to go, the upside potential is a 1000:1. This is not financial advice, but make your own research.Are people / institutions just stashing cash?  I may be misremembering, but I think Japan tried to prevent deflation at one point, and started giving out (I’m betting it was more of a 2-for-1 kind of deal) tender with expiration dates to get people to spend it rather than just save it / stash under mattress / etc.  If this extra currency going around is being stashed away and not being spent on goods, prices won’t increase as fast.

Heck, now that I think about it, if all the extra currency is being consumed in Government bonds, it’s essentially being taken out of circulation, at least until people stop buying T-bills and Government bonds and decide to cash out.  I would think that would be a monumental change in the amount of currency being actively spent.>just[deleted]was Austria truely a world power like the others?Austria wasn't really a world power in that sense. They didn't control trade and the high seas like NL, nor have a large (or in fact, any) overseas empire like the UK. It may have been dominant culturally and socially in its time but that is soft power more than anything.I would disagree. During which period do you believe Austria supplanted the United Kingdom as world power?At which point in time did the Austrian Empire overtake the British Empire?Do you genuinely believe that?> When have we had a dominant democracy before? 

The British Empire.I hope it's Canada, they seem nice.He thinks China for sure.I hope its a United States of Europe :) better for everyone.I see what you mean. And I know people get super touchy on any political topics on the Internet. On the other hand, you literary cannot do any serious analysis without mentioning politics because like it or not its part of our economy and part of our life.

However, I really like how Dalio described his world view. It's not exact quote but he views world as a mechanic. He just looks at different parts and how they interact together and then what do they do. Which makes sense to me if you try to compose serious macro analysis (or understand the world). Yes China has huge human rights issues, yes China steals intellectual property and there are many other issues that make me deeply sad and emotional. But thats not helping me to see the full picture. Thats why I try to use this mechanic approach. Instead I look at the facts, I try to understand what those facts mean (without emotional backdrop) and I think thats helping me way more. I do have my own opinion of course, maybe I like China or maybe I hate it. Either way, it doesn't matter what I like if I want to understand big picture.

I personally think that it is accurate prediction. However, I have suspicion that it could all come to pass long after I'm dead. Maybe in the year 2200 China will rule the world and US will be tiny country. I'll be long dead though so why does it matter. On the other hand, if I was British in the 18th century I would have done very well if I invested in that new growing country called USA instead of going full in on homeland. 

By the way, on topic of China and investing I found Jim Rogers' opinions very interesting and very contrarian which I love.He's not always right, but I can't think of any commentator that I appreciate more than him about investing. He knows his stuff. Definitely must read.> Thus, predicting the demise of the US as supreme power could be accurate, but it could be a very bad thing for the world and something we should be actively fighting to prevent.

Completely depends on who 'takes over'. Everyone is assuming China or some other developing nation like India, but I don't see that happening. I think a more likely scenario is a 'States of Europe' as it's pretty possible the EU marches towards a federal entity like the US.Based on the current CCP regime, no. But eventually, it will probably be the world’s biggest economy and although recently it has been less and less democratic, it likely will be more democratic in the future.Ok, I did not know that Pure Alpha did not generate any alpha for 10 years. In fact, based on casual internet searches I read reports that it did not perform too bad. Not saying you are wrong but can you point where did you read that?

Regarding long term cycle, I'm pretty sure that he never said that. I think you might confuse it with monetary policy (as defined by him):
"Then in 2008 the bubble burst and interest rates hit 0% for the first time since the Great Depression, that changed.  As explained more comprehensively in my book Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises there are three types of monetary policy [...] 2) printing money and buying financial assets, most importantly bonds (which I call Monetary Policy 2 and is now popularly called “quantitative easing”),"Your data on all weather being down this year is incorrect. http://www.lazyportfolioetf.com/allocation/ray-dalio-all-weather/[deleted]>save in gold.

So in that case, buy psychical gold only?  or GLD and such will do the same?Why would you price it against gold and not say the average wage of the population?if its a hedge against the dollar, than shouldn't its cost in dollars rise significantly?What about Bitcoin?

Aren't stocks still a good investment long term? They are real businesses after all? Gold doesn't produce anything.does this sound crazy? I bought a used truck as a second vehicle for 5500 bc it's a desirable truck and if cash truly ends up being trash the truck is a commodity and in the meantime I get the utility of the truck.Silver is up 18% this week.It's not just for industry though its it? It's been used as money for centuries. Sure feels nice to hold some wealth... than just a few numbers in a computer. Can't print gold!So why everyone are running for gold and silver right now like it's the dark ages?Kminder 5 monthsWhy do I always feel like bitcoin is the Linux of investing? 

and I am still waiting for my desktop Linux! 

Thank you I will check it out.Bitcoin follows stock market, so seems like Bitcoin is not "digital gold" at all.I’m not a lawyer but I think you’re confusing Civil Law and Common Law. The US legal system is Common Law, which is based on case law made by the Judicial Branch, while Civil Law is codified in the way you are suggesting. Most of the world has Civil Law but the US, UK and Australia have Common Law.Yes, if you research anything about Austria in depth you will find evidence of it. Vienna was basically the economic and political capital of the world for like 60+ years. It's one of the main reasons I don't put too much stock in the "400 year empire" theory. You have to ignore a LOT of history to make that thesis work.Yes! Metternich is said to have been the greatest foreign minister in history.Depending on how you define Austria (Germanic and Franco alliances and extension of associatio) then yes - it was a major world power leading into WW1They had second or third largest gdp for like 40 years, and not to the same countries either. They were also the center of the political and cultural world at the time. No they didn’t have a navy or water trade routes, but they had allies that did and they had power over them.I answered this same question to another. Feel free to see it for my answer.Overtake in which way? monetarily? They had the second largest economy from like 1870 to 1910ish? (it was pretty big even before that but it was growing extremely fast and not quite at the top). Britain had the largest economy until about the 1880s. At that points China and even Germany took over as #1 GDP but Austria-Hungary was pretty much always #2 or #3. By 1900 the US and Germany started taking over. I'd say that Austria-Hungary had more political and cultural power at the time, which to me makes them the most important Country. If you want to argue specifically GDP-wise, then technically never. But it's not like the US took over right away, it took like 20-30 years in which other countries popped up and faded. I'd argue that for 50-60 years Austria-Hungary was the most important superpower in the world.?? When England was an Empire, it had a king.  Switching to democracy was part of dismantling the empire.

IMO it is incorrect to ever describe a democracy as an empire because an empire is ruled by an emperor (or a king).One thing Dalio didn't touch upon is geography, one of the greatest influences on history. China is neighbors with two nuclear states, one of which it has an ongoing border dispute with and a comparable population size.Nobody is a fan of China so I’d imagine they’d have to take reserve currency status by force. I simply do not see it happen. Demand for US dollars is still super high and nobody is going to endorse a damn digital yuan like they just released. I’d love for someone to play devils advocate to me though 😉Why China though? There's nothing unique about China that could make it rival any regional powers. Making cheap products is cool and all but is it enough to give China an innovative edge over its competitors?long $BABAI like how you automatically knew we were talking about China :)

I guess it's a matter of priorities. I don't think China behaves in a way right now that aligns with my values, and I think that's more important than who's "on top" economically (or worse!! Militarily... let's hope it does not come to that point...?)

\---I also really don't agree with the Keynesian retort of "in the long run we are all dead." You could say this is a weird infusion of humanism and capitalism, but I think in the long run, it matters how the economy is poised for our children and their children. We want the world to be a better place in all ways, including the economy and the environment, not either/or.

The fact that we live in a world where money and debt are power, rather than who has the most nukes or troops to send to the slaughter, is definitely an improvement so far. I say that as a sort of comparison between the 21st and 20th centuries. Definitely want the governments "in charge" to care about freedoms etc though.Agree, and I think that would be an OK outcome, but we should definitely care who "controls" the world, and what their values are.Here’s a public article showing all weather down 12-14% as of March https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/dalio-says-firm-s-slump-what-i-would-have-expected-in-crisis

Wrt to him calling for end of long term debt cycle in 2008 this is well documented, but not in his latest publication of course.I didn’t read it online, I work for a hedge fund and have access to a hedge fund database that has monthly performance by fund (data sources include HFRI and HSBC performance weekly). Not saying it’s been losing money, just no alpha generationThat’s not the all weather fund, that’s a nonsense ETF/asset allocation. You really think bridgewater gets paid 75 basis points on ~$100b in aum for that???Here’s a public article showing all weather down 12-14% as of March https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/dalio-says-firm-s-slump-what-i-would-have-expected-in-crisisSilly indeed.  Will be interesting how he glosses over the inevitable food riots there later this year after the floods.  

My bet:  he doesn't mention them, but his son will be back in Connecticut.Both. 

Buy some coinage for security and some ETFs for liquidity.Physical is the best way for long term savings. For every ounce of gold there are 100+ claims, and it’s worse for silverBitcoin is still speculative, but if nothing particularly negative happens to disrupt it then it's going to be at least fine. And at best will outperform everything several times over as usual.

It gets way too much disrespect for being a consistently well performing asset. If you're not a sheep buying top of bubbles, then there is no reason to hate.i like bitcoin. bullish on gold and btc long term. yes stocks are still a good investment long term, that's not the point. the point is that due to the scarcity of gold (and bitcoin), alongside its other properties as money, you are to maintain purchasing power by simply holding the money. the money itself allows you to store wealth. as i said in my earlier comment - INVEST in stocks, SAVE in gold. as little cash as youre comfortable with.if you bought the truck because you need or have use for a second vehicle, then it was a fine purchase. if you bought it with the intent to resell, no i am not sure it was a great idea.It's been a good week for sure. While I don't forsee this type of gain occurring on a weekly basis I do foresee a steady incline with some healthy pullbacks for the remainder of the year at a minimumGold is not primarily an industrial metal. It is primarily a monetary metal. Even its use as jewelry is as a store of value and not industrial usage. The amount of misunderstanding of gold, monetary history and current financial positioning of the US on this subreddit is mind-boggling. I, along with a handful of others, have been warning users here for years of the corner the Fed has painted itself into. I've noticed an overall slightly more appreciative tone towards our concerns but the general consensus remains to paint us as tinfoil hat wearing conspiracy gold bugs. It's amazing to me the level of denial given how enormous and obvious the monetary problems are.No, but what are you going to do with it yourself other than eventually trade it anyway?But that is my exact point. It is stupid to buy gold “stock” (etfs) if you’re ever going to buy it you buy bullion. But my other point is that it would be even more worthless to buy gold if you don’t have a survival plan in place. Ammo will be 1000x more valuable than gold initially.

Edit:

I bought gold bullion in February. In late March I looked and saw the spot price had dropped with the market.  However, and that’s a huge however, no seller was even accepting the spot price anymore. The actual demand of physical gold had far exceeded the spot price and the two were no longer related. 

This is huge in my opinion it shows a flaw in the gold spot price and shows that it doesn’t actually track the true demand for gold. I haven’t figured it out but my whole point was don’t buy gold unless you’re buying physical gold. Don’t do that unless you’re prepared to survive for along time on your own> Can't print gold!

I’m not a physics guy, but it seems like at some point, someone could figure out how to make gold, no?Gold and silver have monetary premiums which will continue to grow if people lose faith in their national currencies. It's something you can rely on in uncertain timesWhen the real interest rate is so close to zero the opportunity cost of owning gold as a hedge is almost zero. People still consider it as a safe haven so you try to front run the concerns and get out before a liquidity crunchThey're not. You're just falling for logical fallacies.I like this.

Somebody evaluating operating system popularity based only on desktop usage has no idea what they're taking about. 

I'll keep it brief. Desktops are really drops in the bucket when you consider outlooks of continued growth from cloud and IoT businesses. Most IoT platforms and damn near everything in the cloud runs a flavor of Linux and there's nothing looming on the horizon that seems to be threatening its dominance.It seems complicated, but it isn't.

It's a non-sovereign, hard-capped supply, global, immutable, decentralized, digital store of value.I don't have the time to search through the thread so we'll have to leave it there unless you care to copy/paste. At no point in the 19th/20th centuries did Austria surpass the UK as World Power and that's presumably the timeframe we would have to be looking at if you're arguing Netherlands -> UK -> Austria -> US. As a cultural center maybe, but certainly not economically or militarily.Incorrect. The British Empire was administered by the UK which was/is a constitutional Monarchy complete with parliament. The Monarch had very little power. Pretty much limited to appointing a Prime Minister at the request of Parliament and dissolving Parliament for a new general election at the request of that appointed Prime Minister.  The UK has been a democracy for hundreds of years at this point, it didn't suddenly switch to being one when the Empire was replaced by the Commonwealth, or the UK surpassed by the US as a world power.No, the UK  has been a constitutional monarchy with power ultimately held by Parliament since 1688.

The Reform / Representation of the People acts in the 19th Century made it firmly democratic, though short of the universal franchise.It borders 4 nuclear states - India, Russia, Pakistan and North Korea.The British pound remained a reserve currency all the way up to the 1950’s and 1960’s, even though the US had eclipsed the British Empire by the time the US had entered WW1.Does it count if you steal innovation from other countries?china is HUGE. It has more people than the US and EU combined. If they manage to reach western levels on per capital levels then their total output would eclipse the west.I like BABA, TCEHY, and a few of the semiconductor companies heavily reliant in china like CSIQ. That said I don't think the change over to China as our overlords is a sure thing like Dalio does. I think it's more likely that a global economy takes over before any other Super Power really emerges.Cool, thanks for linking that.Think I need a sub to read that. I think I read your comment as referring to the all weather portfolio... Not the all weather fund. My badThey over sell the product? 

Problem is storage.wait what? so just like crypto they are creating value out of thin air? 

will it really matter if no one is actually going to be claiming the gold, just buying and selling hte security? I guess if enough of the security is sold people can't pay? So we constantly just engineer fake wealth and money through various financial instruments - I don't know why I keep fighting the tide and doing a real job\> Bitcoin is still speculative  


Gold isn't?

\> If you're not a sheep buying top of bubbles, then there is no reason to hate.

&#x200B;

According to this sentence anyone buying gold now is a "sheep", correct?I just resold and made $1,100 profit. I think I’m going to try to keep flipping my way up to a brand new truck. Wish me luck.Timeline is always relevant. Until now, government bonds made more sense than gold in most scenarios. At ZIRP, that changes. I just took 10% of my portfolio into paper gold last week.I hear you but why did the spot price drop dramatically in March with the entire market? 

Gold is used in many industrial applications, computers, cables, electronics. If all that shit slows down then the demand does too. The mints had to stop. And yet the demand for physical bullion increased. To the point where dealers weren’t even accepting the spot price anymore.Money supply can grow forever. Inflation can grow forever. The risks start to emerge when overdoing it to counter deflationary pressures and the snap back cause some bigger disruptions. It's a high wire act for sure but nothing the Fed is doing is painting them into a corner other than politically because the investing class will not like to see M2 and low rates pared back. The biggest problem with M2 acceleration is the wealth equality gap widens proportionally and that will eventually break society well before a near term above GDP pegged inflation target.I see it as just another currency really, which I can swap for another currency. The theory being, if the dollar or my own currency crashes... I will be able to ride out the turmoil and swap my gold for whatever currency it is replaced byThat's what money is. A good which holds value because you can trade it for other goodsYeah....same as money. Its a store of value that you trade for something you need.But will it be less expensive to synthesize than purchasing gold?I guess at some point could have quantum computers which can crack all encryption also? Our ones and zeros in the bank might be in trouble.Could you elaborate which logical fallacies in particular?Hmm, mine didn’t work. I think it needs an exclamation mark. 

kminder! 5 months.

Btw, I am setting a reminder because I disagree with you and expect that in ~5 months time you’ll be proven dead wrong in that it doesn’t take an apocalypse to move the price of gold materially higher. Currency debasements do the job just fine of inflating the prices of assets.

It doesn't smell good.But you have the time to write another comment? Haha, okay.It was a slow transition.Oh wow. There can be 2 reserve currencies? Honestly didn’t know thatI wouldn't think so.  Anyone can steal technology. That won't give them a path to a role as a world leader.Yes they're a large country but they don't have anything special about them besides having a lot of people.  They export no culture unlike western countries. They don't create new ideas they simply make cheap knockoffs based on other countries ideas. 

As far as I see it they're just a sweatshop with money. There's just no way to compete if you can't innovate.Sure, I want to reiterate that I like ray and appreciate you linking the book, I may read it. Just want to point out some of his predictions have been wrong on this topic (just like all of us he makes mistakes)Buy a safe.Just put it in a fire proof box in a closet. Don't tell people about it. People have this fear that I will be stolen. While theoretically true, this risk is insignificant. There is a much better chance you experience a home invasion and get tragically murdered or worseHahaha anything paper is created out of thin air. The dollar , paper gold , paper silver ..Lol massive dumbass, where in my sentence did I educate you on how to identify top of bubbles and where did I mention gold?Indeed. Why would I have bought gold last  year at a 0.4% expense ratio when I could have bought inflation protected bonds with 1% real yield that I could hold with zero expense ratio? Now real yields are negative. It’s a different ball game where it makes sense to buy gold even if it costs money to store it.Gold makes sense now as real yields are negative. Focusing on ZIRP only takes into account nominal rates.People speculate that there was a liquidity crunch and people sold all assets to obtain fiat. Gold was not spared. Who knows if that's the true reason though.

Industrial usage makes up a tiny fraction of gold's use. Slowing of industrial demand won't have an appreciable effect on price. Most gold is simply minted as bars or coins or fashioned into jewelry as a store of value. Demand outpaced supply a few months ago as mints shut down due to COVID and dealers were unable to meet that demand. Retail prices for coins and bars sold at significant premiums over spot. That's a sign of strength as far as I'm concerned.I think that's a pragmatic way to look at it.At first probably not. In fact I think we can theoretically do it now but it’s expensive. But eventually, probably? I dunno, again I’m not a physicist but I know we can produce diamondsI also want an earlier reminder

kminder! 2 months 15 daysRemindMe! 5 monthsOk so let’s compare the returns of the spy to the returns of gold then. 

I’m NOT saying gold won’t go up (of course it will due to all the money that was just printed) I am just saying it’s not a hedge against inflation.

To really understand Bitcoin, you have to understand how money works. Most people don't have a clue. Once you start learning about Bitcoin, you go down the rabbit hole. You learn how banks work, how money is being printed, who are benefitting and suffering from it, and then you see that Bitcoin is just a superior form of money in every. single. way.

And personally I'm a software engineer, I'm also fascinated by the technical aspect of it and the problem it resolves (how to prevent the copy of a digital piece of information without any centralization).

Again, do as you please. Do your own research. I'll just reiterate: If Bitcoin goes where it's supposed to go, you are looking at a 1000:1 return. Bitcoin is either going to 0 or to incredible high amounts, not in-between. It's been here for 12 years, survived multiple bubbles, and today the network fundamentals are stronger than ever.

I'm not saying go all-in. But putting 1% to 5% of your net worth "just in case" doesn't seem too irresponsible.Yeah a lot of people think its a ponzi but it really is just digital gold that you dont really have to store anywhere but in your brain. Super convenient.Yes, I'm at work so it's quite easy for me to check for replies to my own comments, but I'm not about to waste 10-15 minutes chasing down another posters comment to someone else in the thread when they could have just as easily quoted themselves. Haha, okay.A reserve currency just means generally that central banks hold that currency as part of their forex reserves. Many central banks actually hold several currencies in reserve. Currently, the USD holds a 60% share of global reserve currencies, with the Euro holding 20%. USD is actually lower than pound sterling in WW2, as 80% of global central bank holdings were in pound sterling at that time. However, in the 1950s, the pound sterling had fallen to 55% of global central bank reserves, but this will drastically decline as the value of the pound sterling took a beating over the next 2 decades. 

Looking at current global central bank holdings, the Euro is generally considered a reserve currency and the USD is the primary one. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#Global_currency_reserves

There is no inherent reason other countries must use USD as reserves. The USD is selected primarily because (1) exchange rate stability, (2) liquidity, and (3) incumbency. If you look at the GPB/USD exchange rate historically, the pound sterling was remarkably stable from 1800 until WW2.You are absolutely right to say this. I have a lot of respect for Dalio but I also hate when famous investors are being idolized as if they make no mistakes. So you comments are very welcomed.no shit, but you can't suddenly say oh this 1 dollar bill is going to 'fork' into 2 dollars.How am I dumbass? I never said you told to identify bubbles and you did not mention gold.

  
You said that sheep are buying top of bubbles.

&#x200B;

God was low and now it is near ATH, that is a bubble. And sheep are buying now, so people buying now gold are stupid?And, importantly, I see no realistic option for the government moving forward other than continued dollar devaluation/LIRP + ZIRP/printing. The debt has gotten too big to manage any other way. Those conditions favor appreciation in gold price.And, importantly, I see no realistic option for the government moving forward other than continued dollar devaluation/LIRP + ZIRP/printing. The debt has gotten too big to manage any other way. Those conditions favor appreciation in gold price.That’s a bad comparison. Diamonds are made of carbon and synthetic diamonds are made of compressed carbon, doing the work of time and pressure. 

Gold is an element. You would have to synthetically create real gold from other elements. Possible? Yes. Easy? No. Orders of magnitude harder than making a synthetic diamond.Naturally formed diamonds and man-made diamonds are differentiated and detectable; it's not as difficult as you think.

Furthermore; company like De Beers (that still has a large influence on diamond supply chains) spend millions upon millions a year to enforce and R&D methods to track/detect natural diamonds vs man-made diamonds...There is a 18 hour delay fetching comments.

|-|-|-|-|I will gladly take that bet. I’m also not saying the S&P won’t go up (or down) but I think gold will appreciate significantly more than SPY through the end of the year. Looking forward to seeing where things are at in 5 months!I own Bitcoin, I use bitcoin, I develop cryptographic solutions, but it's not better than a central bank for a society at large and will remain a niche, barring some catastroohic shift in the entire global order that no one has even imagined, because it is good for two things only. 
1) speculation
2) transferring money outside of the financial regulatory systems and even that isn't very great considering the high spreads and liquidity. 

It does not allow for the elasticity of monetary policy. 
Unless you are going to get banks involved to act as escrow have no purchase protection. 
If you fuck up and lose your keys your Bitcoin is gone forever. If you propose the layman keeps their Bitcoin with an exchange (aka bank), when the bank gets hacked it is insolvent and your money is all gone.
It can't be insured without leverage and that is what most people claim Bitcoin solves is preventing leverage (inflation).

I don't care if the system is built on Bitcoin, dollars, toenail clippings... You can't run commerce and economic policy on scale without the institutions you are inferring are bad that Bitcoin can replace. What would prevent treasury from issuing debt even if it were ran on Bitcoin until the money supply was exhausted and you have a deflationary spiral? What would prevent public corps from just monopolizing the network and forking and causing a shit storm? Now you have execs and boards at PTCs running monetary policy. 

Bitcoin is amazing for collecting that win from your out of state bookie or sending profits from a shady enterprise back to your bosses in South America. For everything else it pretty much sucks compared to having a bank card.The problem is that governments can kill it if they want to, which means the banks can kill it through their influence over the government, if they want to.Cool.Just go to their profile it will be right there. I found their comment in 10 seconds, just to give an actual data point. No animosity here, just trying to be usefulGreat info thanks!Well that’s one way to solve our national debt...Isn't that literally what the fed is doing lol.Ah yes blindly calling people “sheep” so one can feel superior. Its the reddit way.Yes, but it would require coordinated killing to work. Any one government will not have a huge effect. Even if it's the US/China, that would be a big blow initially, but not a fatal one.yup.I mean, i wasnt complaining. Poof, you now have more money.**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*I think he’s just waiting for interest rate hikes down the road , when the fed increases interest rates the price of bank stocks will increase due to their margins growingBAC is surprisingly solid...but Wells Fargo were good fellas once too...Great can't wait for the 9 Motley Fool Podcasts about this this week.Really good value. Probably  means he thinks the second dip isn't going to be as big as he initially thought. I've actually been increasing my stake in BRKB recently. Value investing in a really good value investing corporation seems like too good of a deal to pass up.Real question... Who is taking over when Buffett dies?  How does that impact, and the uncertainty of the competency of the successor, affect the value of Berkshire Hathaway?I think I made a good call buying BAC the other week at under 23Are these the only buys he did during the pandemic? Did he buy BoA or anything else  in the month of March after prices fell off a cliff or even in April?I thought he always kept his stakes in banks under 10%?Good for me, I own BAC stockGreat now buy mine slightly above my cost basis please.Good thing that I bought it two weeks ago!This doesn't make sense.  Wouldn't he want to keep it under 10% to not risk being labeled as a BHC?  Or was it a higher %?I wanted to make a long term bet on banks and was leaning towards JP Morgan but Berkshire believing made up my mind.It could be worse. He's been betting on banks for a long time now and so far it really hasn't paid off, but I hope my Berkshire shares will take off soon.Don’t forget, interest rate hikes will take years to undo the current lows. Everyone is racing to refinance mortgages right now. That’s a 30-year loan period at next to no return for the bank. 


Think of it like this, any loan that was in existence is now at a minimum rate. If the same amount of new loans go out after hike, that’s 1/30th of mortgages at a decent return for the bank.


Edit: when do the new lobs outweigh the old, year 15? Is that when banks profits begin to increase at considerable margins?Big banks always win is probably his DD lolBrb about to copy him. Can't go wrong.Outside of stealing from low income customers, how does BOA make money?[removed]Why doesn't he just take his own advice and buy an S&P fund?He should just dump his cash in ARK and let Cathie manage it for him. Insurance, gas and banking pfffI think Buffet is old fashioned and doesn't understand the current market.That might not happen in his lifetimeYup. A couple of Buffett quotes from last year:

“I think stocks are ridiculously cheap if you believe ... that 3% on the 30-year bonds makes sense.” 

“Since money doesn't cost anything, you can print lots of money and have full employment and no inflation. … I wouldn't think you can have these things at these levels — long-term rates, interest rates, budget deficits — have that at a stable situation for a long period of time.”The problem with this is banks are extremely vulnerable right now because people could start mass defaulting on unsecured credit lines and then these banks will have to take billions in losses.Wouldn't raising interest rates cause too many bankruptcies? Companies are too overleveraged.Is there an etf that follows bank stocks?If interest rates go up, we will collapse. The greatest depression of all time, is what it'll be called in the history books, if they dare raising rates.The difference is that Wells Fargo did it to themselves.It's lagging the SP so hard. If you look at past history this has never happened for long!They've been planning the succession for a long time...kudos for being one of the few ppl on reddit to ask this impt question!

He has two longtime lieutenants running half of brk businesses each... ajit jain and Greg abelCathie Wood from ARK might succeed him.

She's already considered the "Warren Buffett of Tech".

Also, Dave Portnoy might be an option, since he has taken the throne of investing!Hold on tight.
I bought my big chunk the day the markets seized in March. I need to keep building more.Cool storyThis was disclosed right away because it puts Berkshire above 10% ownership of BAC. No one knows how much stock Berkshire bought until the quarterly report comes out in a few weeks. The quarterly report will reveal the amount of cash flowing into equities. The specific buys will not be revealed until the 13f comes out in the middle of August.

TLDR: The information isn’t public yetHe was selling at that point IIRCBought a shitload of natural gas pipelines not too long ago.This makes me think they must see really compelling value here because they've always had a policy of keeping equity stakes under 10% from my memory.That's what I'm trying to figure out now. If he sold out of his massive Wells Fargo holding he'd have to disclose that. And if he did then they'd tank even more. But that's not the case. Unless some regulatory things have changed and he can get away with that or just literally I have no idea.Both are awesome. JPM blew it out of the water recently. BAC not so much. Either one is a solid long term hold I think.BH shares are down 20% so far this year.I don't think buffet logs into TD Ameritrade and buys stocks.  I'm sure he got a good deal that retail investors couldn't replicate.Ripping customers off is how banks make money. Customers don’t seem to care. Bank of America is huge, they’ve made it through all the other banking consolidation. They just had a good quarter. 

Your reasoning for not investing is because they have poor customer service? Their “ripping off” apparently isn’t illegal so.......BoA over the past 5 years has vastly outperformed its sector and I believe wells fargo will outperform its sector over the next 5-10. Scharf is doing a fantastic jobEither a stock is cheap or it isn’t. You can account for all sorts of things with a large enough margin of safety.His life is investing. He recommends index funds for random 9-5 people who got something in their Roth or 401k.because he can make better gains.Why are so many people dick-riding Cathie?Yea it’s all those 20 year old Robin Hood traders who understand the market perfectly well, until the bubble bursts.Go back to wall street bets young oneactually you don't need too many innovation to grow your money.

I don't know why Warren Buffet buy BoA, but it still makes much more sense than buying Tesla.

Don't get me wrong, Tesla to me is obviously much better company than BoA. But as investment at its current price, i would trust Buffet more than random robinhood trader.He's got a net worth in the neighborhood of $90B, he doesn't care about his lifetime at this point. What fund manager at almost 90 years old is still being a fund manager to make money? Only really bad ones. He's doing this for the chase, the game, and the mental exercise that goes into these decisions and he knows the return on these investments is likely very many years down the road.Tomorrow might not happen in his lifetime.  😂

At this point I have to think he is more of a senior advisor and is not as hands on as he was.  But it is useful to be the face.He knows something more than us obviously. Generally when money is cheap , like low interest rates , asset prices will increase dramatically. To bring them to norm, Fed raises interest rates at much faster rate than usual. I think that will happen in 2022. Didn't he say that it reminds him of Paul Volcker in his last meeting?Buffet has enough money to retire and live his life 100x over with a much less frugal lifestyle than he currently has, and still not worry about money...

He clearly doesn't do this for himself, but because he's passionate about itI doubt he'll cash out before he diesSo like a few months then?

The guy is 89.Is that second one out of context? WtfPeople are being handed zillions in government aid. That will keep defaults under control.

I'd worry about the effects of all the money the government is printing, not the banks.xlfYes.[VFH](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VFH?p=VFH)Value investing doesn’t care what is trailing the S&P 500, it cares what is and also shouldn’t be.This question is being asked and answered in almost every thread about BRK on reddit... or is this sarcasm?Lol nope it'll be Greg abel or ajit jain>Also, Dave Portnoy might be an option, since he has taken the throne of investing!

Haha!Berkshire is beneath Portnoy. DDTG Global is the new king of the street.Cool story *bro*

FTFYI believe [this](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-05/buffett-s-berkshire-ends-deal-drought-with-dominion-energy-bet) is Buffet's only other buy during COVID. Dominion EnergyIf you combine the below links and others in the recent years , there seems to be a clear pattern that banks invest in new technology and BOA is clearly ahead compared to other US banks. Many people in the financial industry have said that blockchain technology will be one of the disrupting technologies in the sector.

Berkshire's performance over the last few years has left much to be desired.You’re right, he uses RobinhoodIt's the Comcast model.She was ridiculed on cnbc etc with her disruptive tech portfolio and tesla price targets. Whilst they were, in your terms, Dick-riding Buffet and his airline plays. She proved them all wrong.What bubble? The government has shown us they won't let the market crash.Warren (Bitcoin is a scam) Buffet sold the bottom of the airlines and bought the top of the banks. He's becoming one of those meme investor, like Andrew Left, where you should reverse his moves. Apple has been his best STOCK investment in the last decade, but he was super late on it and everything else he has touched has instantly become a dumpster fire.I think he’s making these decisions to put his successors in as optimal a position as possible. Once he & Munger have passed away, Berkshire will have a huge question mark hanging over it’s head. With deals like these (that may take a decade or more to start working), he can pave that path for them to maintain Berkshire’s reputation & track record.He is doing it for his wife. When he dies he is leaving his wealth to his wife.Tomorrow may not happen in any of our lifetimes🤷🏻‍♀️Tomorrow might not happen in our lifetime buddy.

Nothing is guaranteed to anyone.The issue is if they raise rates people are in such a poor economic state they will struggle to make repayments. Otherwise they would have done it a long time ago.If the fed raises interest rates too fast, they'll create another 2008 mortgage/debt crisis pretty damn fastMaybe 2032what would he even do after cashing out? 

Would laugh if he did something wild and just bought every super yatch in the world and made them race accross the Atlantic for no apparent reason89 is not what is used to be. Buffet could have another 20 years on him.

The ever-popular Dr. Fauci is 79 for example. Does he look like it? He runs 3 miles every day or something.

We're in the 2020s, not 1920s. People are going to be living a lot longer than they used to. Especially when you have money.Buffett *doesn’t* think it’s sustainable. As he goes on to explain: “The convergence of these factors would seem impossible to me. Generally if I feel something is impossible, it's going to change over time. I don't know in what way, but I don't think we can continue to have these variables in this relationship.”

They're sharp for their age but they're still old.Yeah, possibly.I think Abel, specially after he was sitting next to him at the online meeting and the Dominion deal. Too bad he seems to lack the charisma Buffet oozesShe hasn’t proved anyone wrong. You’ve got to judge over a longer timeframe than a few years late into a bull market. Ark is simply taking advantage of the disruption hype.How long is her track record?A bubble inflated by the fed is still a bubbleThe government tries to support the economy. They can’t protect the market from crashing. Nobody knows what’s going to happen. Who needs cash? Who loses his or her business, how will unemployment rates develop. What will all those new investors do when there is a dip of of 20%? Will they lose their cool? Nobody knows, let’s see where it goes.Because his wife needs more money in addition to the 90 billion...Hey Buffet its me, your wife.Except that he isn't, in that he's pledged 99% of his wealth to charity through "The Giving Pledge."Yes, they would have done that little faster in the last decade. But , I think it would not take many years for them to raise rate like how people are expecting. It happened at one time in 70's or 80's and many companies with heavy debt plummeted badly and went out of business too.Remember that the Fed raised rates leading into and during the Great Depression (1928 and 1929) as a means of limiting speculation in the markets. Yeah people will struggle to make repayments but that's the cost they're willing to let others pay.The fed won't even raise rates in a good economy, so I doubt they will raise rates in a bad one.  When they try raise rates and reduce balance sheet a little bit, the market didn't like it and they backed off immediately and start expanding their balance sheet to calm the market.Human lifespan has not significantly increased in the last 100 years. Life expectancy of the average human has, which is the largely due to a decrease in early life deaths.Ah duh I seeIt started as a shit post, but feck it I'm committed now. 

We both know that Buffet has underperformed to the S&P500 over the last decade. So not sure why you bring that up against someone who has outperformed his returns in a decade within a year. 

 If you want to wait a number of years to see how Cathie ARK does before you rate her, that's cool. I don't hold any investment in ARK but sure as hell I take note of her major buys.

The underlaying thing behind this all, is that Buffet does not invest in tech, cause he does not invest in things he does not understand.

What industry had the most growth in the last years? Tech.

Now, his arguably most succesful investment in the recent years is actually in tech: Apple. One of his employees took a stake in Apple and Buffet liked his/her reasoning and copied the move with significant capital. Can you imagine his returns if he did not own any Apple?

So the crux is, if he does not understand Tech and therefore not invest in it. He should find and hire the best person on the planet that does.There has already been a >20% dip just a few months ago and at the end of 2018 what are you even talking aboutIf you spent 5 million everyday for the next  30 years, you'd barely spend 55 billion. Anyone worth over $50 billion is basically royalty in the US.Good point with your last sentence. Many have over leveraged themselves with the cheap supply of money. Raising rates would shake out those groups.This exact thing happened in 1999. There were multiple fund managers that similarly outperformed Buffett that year. By 2001 they had all lost most of their investors money....

So how long is her track record?This is rampant speculation from someone who has zero knowledge beyond popular financial media.   Read a book... or better yet a berkshire investor letterThose 20% dips do nothing to robinhood investors. The average robinhood investor is up several thousand percentage points. Granted turning 1k into 10k doesn't change much.in the ~~US~~ world*The main difference is the treasury market today is practically useless. Then you could look at solid 4% returns, whereas now you're experiencing negative real rates in the treasury market. 

The liquidity pump of today will have its day of reckoning, whether we get higher income taxes, higher corporate taxes, higher interest rates, or a combination of all three. Something has to give due to this cash dump in regards to getting our debt/GDP under control.I reacted on the anticipation you would answer 'durr, too short track record, Buffet has 50 years experience'. But guess I'm playing chess and you are looking at a checkers board.Please point out the speculation or errors in my post. There is no speculation as I give no financial advice, tickers, strategies or anything. I think you are extrapolating a persona upon me from how you read this comment.“The average Robinhood investor is up several thousand percentage points”.  There is no way you actually believe that.Not in Zimbabwe, they ain'tWrong.

Cathie has only ‘proven’ herself by investing in high beta stocks during the strongest bull market in history.He’ll be one of the first to panic and sell everything.They are once they start making it rain.If you had $50B in Zimbabwe you might own the country.Exactly. To tout her as superior to Buffet is insane. They also have different aims. Buffet is all about secured cash flow companies, why he was so opposed to airlines until he wasn't and got burned for it. The growth of a company for Buffet isn't targeted at 20%/yr like some of these tech companies that are surviving off low cost of debt and a low interest rate market where the ultra wealthy have fewer places to park cash than these blank check companies.They are outperforming Buffet and so am I. If this crash does happen it'll bring BAC (which Buffet owns now) down with it too.It's 50B Zimbabwean dollars.I don't see any comment saying she's superior to Buffett? Just that she was right on this one specific play.Everybody's a genius in a bull marketThere is a 50% chance of being "right on one specific play" every time. It's a coin flip. I think people are scrutinizing you due to your comment not even attempting to address the question on Cathie's track record. Any idiot can be right on one specific play or a handful of plays in a short term (i.e. one of the most rapid recoveries in the market along with an insane growth in tech in the short term) vs someone who has consistently, over the long term, delivered consistent and high performing results.I wasn't the person making the comment about her vs Buffett or track records.  
  
Also, I don't agree at all that being right is a coin flip. Yes there are two outcomes, but they don't have an equal probability.**Hi, welcome to /r/investing. Please note that as a topic focused subreddit we have higher posting standards than much of Reddit:**

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*Just to be clear, here.... you sold at the bottom of a historic crash and now you are considering buying at all time highs? AND you are looking at Reddit to tell you what to do?

My dude. VOO all in. DCA any new funds right the fuck into it and forget about it for a few years.Reflect on your experience of this expensive lesson

Understand what made you decide to invest originally, and then what made you decide to sell

Say out loud about 1000 times: “I cannot time the market.”

Accept that the realized losses and missed opportunities are in the past and unrecoverable, but it’s not the end is the world.  There are more profits to be had in the future. 

Pick an asset allocation that is suitable for buying and holding both during all time highs and also black swan lows. 

Lump sum into your all-weather portfolio if you’re up for it (statistically prudent) or dollar cost average over a couple months at most.zoom out and you will see it is just one big bull market.We know for a fact that the moment you buy back in the market will crash, but at the same time if you keep waiting the market will keep going up and no matter how long you wait on the sideline, the market will still crash the moment you buy in, so it's better to just buy in now and watch the market crash now then to wait and have it crash you uby in later.Bull market or not, there will be another dip. Markets are irrational as people don’t spend and live the way they did before the pandemic and markets act like e erything will be back to normal by the end of the year/mid 2021. Question is when they will correct and how.. double dip or flatten out for a year.. I have no clue.

So Jump in and spread your buys in time for the long run.As someone who sold 75% of my holdings at nearly the bottom and have been waiting and regretting, I'm very interested in what people have to say..DCA over the coming months and learn the lesson of never timing the market with your entire portfolio. In the last couple of years people on here coming to the conclusion of "just sell everything" way too easily when it should be something done very rarely - if ever. Take *some* profits into strength if you feel that it is prudent to do so and wait to re-deploy.First step: Realize that you can't get out of a pickle with the same kind of thinking that got you into the pickle.

So what got you into the pickle? Thinking you can play crashes and make the dips work for you.

So "Slowly drip feed when there is a dip" will not get you out of the pickle. It's the exact same faulty kind of thinking. 

Work out an asset allocation that suits your risk tolerance (I guess you have low risk tolerance if you cashed out in March...) and invest in that. And since you are risk averse, you should probably dollar-cost-average. Lump sum is better, statistically, but takes more stomach.Buy value stocks, especially the ones that haven't recovered to their February prices.This is an extremely difficult position to be in. Here is what I would do: I would DCA into the market because you're likely to make a sharp reaction if you go all in and the market beings to drop. I would also allocate toward value, both domestic and international. If not value, at least a market-weighted index fund. Even if tech continues to outperform, you're in too much of a difficult spot to chase a trend, and given your past actions, you're likely to make a mistake by taking on more volatility. The best thing to do is to learn from your mistake. A value tilt gives you the best risk-reward. Diversification gives you peace-of-mind and the opportunity to achieve out-performance.Big thing to realize is you were most likely invested over your risk tolerance.

Most people way over estimate their risk tolerance, probably realize this and investing more conservatively and add bonds to reduce risk.Theory says invest it all right now if you plan to hold and aren't into market timing.Wait a couple more months. Justification: 

Stimulus checks end / the number of new cases doesn't go down, instead, it keeps going up / FED can't keep doing it indefinitely / some states started to close down again / the companies started to declare their Q2 results and so on...

What is important, there is no bull run now, it is more or less staying on the same level. Even if you assume that crisis is over, in the worst case you will lose 2-3 months of appreciation.   


I didn't sell in March, just a portion of it by the end of May when it had mostly recovered. I am also waiting for it to fall a bit before I pump back again.This is why we're going to head much, much higher in the weeks to come. There is OCEANS of cash caught on the sidelines, and eventually they're going to cave to the FOMO and buy back in, and that's when the fun REALLY starts. We haven't seen nothing yet :-)What were you planning for back in March? As in, back then when would you have expected and how to get back in or what was that going to be based on? What was your plan and are you executing it? What kind of investor are you trying to be? What was your plan with the money when you put it in?I got out just before the drop through pure luck (transferring my 401k to vanguard)

I've stayed out since. I'm not sure when I'll get back in if there's no drop. 

I am not confident at all that Congress will continue to bail out individuals. If that stops company profits will drop. The current level of unemployment in the US is  really bad and these people will not be able to just return to work when a vaccine is widely available. In many cases their employers no longer exist.I would focus on value investing. Plenty of blue chips are still down 20%> as everyone keeps saying the probability of "March crash" to repeat is slim to none as investors now know that the Fed has got their back.

What does this mean if corporate profits are tanking?   

The "fed has your back" (if true) because everything sucks.One thing I read that has helped me: "The price is the price."

The lesson I've taken from it is that I should not be emotionally anchored to my previous buys/sells. The price is the price it is at now. Do you want it now or not?Sit on your ass like an idiot and say well... at least I made the same decision as Stan Druckenmiller.Everything looks like trash to me. I havent done what you did, but I still had and do have cash. 

Since fundamentals dont matter and faith in fiat is getting shaken, precious metals are expensive, then that leaves bitcoin. It similarly did a stage a big recovery, but it also is under half of its previous all time high. I dont see any other option for myself.It sounds like you're thinking with a short-term view in mind. If you take a long term view and you're content with your money being tied up then you should proceed as normal, do your own research, find investments which you are confident will perform well over the long term. 

You can take advantage of the short-term volatility by dollar-cost averaging.What's wrong with a 60-40 split. Whenever your actual allocations misalign with target by more than, say, 5%, then rebalance. There isn't much thinking.put it all in VOO and forget about itIf you didnt go in during the massive crash in march, I dont see how you would ever be comfortable going in. Sounds like you will always make the excuse "well itll probably  go down more" no matter if it drips 10, 20, or 60%. Stocks maybe aren't for youWait, the virus is getting worse so things will get worse. Personally I'd just trade for now and not invest.If you cash out on March 23 you’re a fool. Buy high sell low always wins.Take your loss and learn the lesson. 
Or invest in hihi interest saving account.

You are not made for stocks.I finally took some off the table this last week. Monday of last week to be specific. I think Tech leads the way up and the way down. And I think we are seeing too many tech stocks with blow off top type upward moves. I'm missing some gains but I didn't go full cash and am still letting 60% of my 401k alone. The election uncertainty alone is normally good enough for people to follow the "sell in May and go away" advice. But this has been an extraordinary market. My hope is to take my 40% that is now in bonds and rotate them back into Tech heavy index funds once the market cools off. I could be wrong but experience tells me that I just need to be patient and stick to my plan. Just FYI, I did buy the March lows. I increased my 401k contributions drastically to 34% of my income and capitalized on the blood in the streets while many of my co-workers were selling their stocks at quite possibly the worst time.lol can we talk about the fact I cashed out of both NIO and TSLA bc I was afraid of NIO bankruptcy and that TSLA was at way too high of a valuation? 

Everything I cashed out of to have money on the side to buy during this dip ended up costing me massivelyGo all in TSLA for a week and make back your paper loses.The dollar is fucked. You need to not sit on cashI cashed out in late 2019, expecting a correction... sat out most of the run up, and now am about even YoY. Spent most of it in treasuries, so up a little. I don’t feel too bad... the first rule is “don’t lose money.” I couldn’t afford to lose my retirement on a double dip. I’m now back in the market in some hedged funds which limit upside, and hedge downside (VQT, PHDG, BTAL, TAIL) as well as gold and LT treasuries.People here will tell you you can't time the market. I think this is just the opinion of reddit "investors" who regurgitate whatever was fed to them when they first started.

One can time the market very easily, otherwise there won't be successful stock market traders jobs.

I also sold in March, but then got back in immediately after they announced infinite QE and the stimulus plans. I don't think there will be another dip for a long time as the Fed and government cannot have all their work go to waste

Get in now in lump sum rather than DCA so you can achieve good gains much fasterVegas, baby.  You can't be this unlucky twice.When did you cash out hope it wasn't the circuit breaksGOD DAMNHow much cash in absolute numbers  are we talking about?Precious metals seem to be a decent buy right now.I guess don't feel so bad, 2020 is the year of black swan events.  I understand your thinking pulling out because things can still get worse:

&#x200B;

\- A possible Hail Mary attempt at some sort of disruption by anti-Trump forces

\- Iran - Israel tensions 

\- The real second wave or winter edition of Covid (viruses spread better in dry winter air) and school re-openings will probably wreak havoc making the current uptick look like nothing. Priced in? Maybe, but to what level of carnage?

\- Post election implosion:

\----- If Biden wins due to increased taxes on corporations

\----- If Trump winds, money printers slow down / turn off since this can't be sustained for ever

&#x200B;

I've seen articles across the internet and YouTube saying we are in a bubble for some reason and its going to implode for another. 

The smart people who saw Covid coming before it caused the dip could be seeing something else and could be waiting to bail for the right moment.  Things can be predicted.

Get a financial advisor to salvage what you have and don't beat yourself up about it.

&#x200B;

Just an amateurs opinion, do I belong in WSB?>What does one do with the money they cashed out? where do they invest?

For me (stock picker) the most risky thing right now is insolvency/bankruptcy or CRs due to business being affected by Covid, so I rebalanced into stocks with healthy balance sheets, in industries less likely to be affected negatively (eg tech, medical etc).

There's really not a huge amount of great investment options outside of the stock market at the moment and cash isn't ideal either, so I just went searching for healthy growth stocks.All in on QQQ and stop trying to time the market, you tried and failed and now you know betterBruh if you really have no idea what to do, just DCA into ETFs like VOO/VUG. 

No one knows what is gonna happen but you're just gonna be forever missing out on gains / losing money to inflation if you keep it in cash forever because you don't want to pull the trigger.You sold your entire portfolio in March? RIP RIP>cashing out in March

lmao, wtf r u doin man, you are supposed to BUY the dip not SELL it. BUY!I've been using Cash Secured Puts to tip toe back into the market.  Either the puts expire out of the money and I just keep the premium, or the stock dips to the strike price I sold the puts at and I now own the stock.  I've only been doing this with stocks I'm familiar with already and willing to own at the strike price I'm selling the puts at.

If you never get assigned, you're at least collecting way more than the money you would earn parked in a high yield savings account.Small cap valueSell cash secured puts to rake in money and get a lower basis if you are assigned.I'm buying BRK B, it's well diversified and still "on sale" compared to tech/SPY/etc.

Some people think Buffett is too old/cautious for this market, and they're right maybe, but this market is too crazy for me so some of my money is with WarrenB's "timing".Your money and ultimately your choice but I’m takin on a more drip feed approachLets say Amazon hit its bottom at 10 bucks.  Now it is up to 15 bucks.

Should you get back in?  Or wait for a dip?There is so much money outside. Big players will have to invest more and more in near future. Old metrics and evaluation methods do not hold anymore in these crazy times.I'm still holding 95% cash. I'm in no hurry. I've been ready to invest since 2017, I've trades a bit. 

Made $10 per share on FAZ, in one weekYou are making the classic investor mistake. You are looking in hindsight trying to predict the future. For someone like you I'd say just buy a good distribution many sectors or diversified etfs the majors get some dividends and buy more significant dips. Do not put all your money into stocks diversify.

Never make the mistake of thinking anyone knows better than you do. No one know what will happen next they are liars if they say they know anything for certain or insider trading. Some people are just better at handling driving blind than others doesn't mean they won't go off a ledge one day.You probably need to target specific sectors, because not all have recovered like tech and pharma. Aerospace is an extreme example because they won't recover for several years.I still have 30% bond and did not buy in during March crash. I am afraid to buy it now and patiently waiting for another correction.stop trying to time the market and average into it consistently and you never lose long term... and take reddit financial advices with grain of salt.Thanks mate!! I'm trying to get over the mistake I made in March but agree, I cannot time the market.

I will start DCA soon, lets see how it goes.I get the "time in the market" mantra, but even averaging in is better than sitting on the sidelines. And it allows OP to avoid the regret that would invariable occur if their one lump sum investment went in exactly before the market did make a small correction.

So yeah, if it was a friend of mine that was on the sidelines afraid, I'd suggest they dip their toes in the water and commit to weekly purchases. Long-term in an upward market, that obviously isn't as good, but it helps add a cushion against an adverse move that causes the person to cash out and flee again.

Good reco on the All-Weather portfolio, certainly one of the portfolios thats shown itself to be much lower risk than many others.And for those of us who sold a little on the way down and bought a lot at the bottom? The lesson is probably that having a high and safe income, alongside balls to buy when everyone is panicking, is probably more important than any advice you'll see on a reddit thread"Accept that the realized losses and missed opportunities are in the past and unrecoverable, but it’s not the end is the world"

This guy just miss the buy low part.Thanks just bought Zoom...Facts.Underated comment here.This is my position, and I think a lot of people that are holding cash are getting those FOMO feels right now. Real talk: unemployment is >10%, US/China relations continue to degrade, and the virus continues to spread, interrupting business and trade. 

The current stock market price reflects all the money governments have pumped into the economy (I'm seeing numbers as high as $15 trillion globally). It's not based on tangible business growth. I think the downside risk is much higher than the upside potential right now.That's a huge misunderstanding of how much money is on the sidelines in a thread about money being on the sidelines.Don’t spend? Well that sounds like savings!

Moar amo for all the new amateur quarantine day traders.

THERE IS NO OTHER ASSET!
 
Just accept it may be halved when you need it, but then again everyone will be fucked so prices will come down too for a while until a couple years go by and everyone is stock market rich again!Since you're on reddit I assume you're in your 20s or 30s. You shouldn't have sold anything. You should have doubled down, reinvested dividends, maxed out 401k, maxed out IRA, etc.

By the time most people decide and react to sell during a downturn, it's usually too late. I rode out the .com bubble, the financial crisis bubble, and I'll ride out this one. Each time making an absolute killing at the end of the day because I reacted not by selling, but by investing heavily.Do you know why you did that?  If you do, you might be able to make better decisions in the future.  If you do not, you might want to move to an investment advisor who can prevent you from selling in the future, or you might want to do some additional research.  Some people do not have the temperament to be good investors, just like some people aren't good cooks, or good teachers, or good carpenters.  No shame in it.

I made a similar decision at SPX 2850, and have moved largely to gold and individual stocks with a large amount of cash on the sidelines.  The stocks I've picked have been large companies that I feel are in excellent shape to survive this recession.  I have avoid the big tech names, because they all appear to be overvalued to me.

FWIW, As a general rule I do not sell stocks, or worry about my retirement.  Last time I sold I had some stock in the dot com I was working for, and had lost my job.  It seemed likely that the company was not going to recover (it didn't) and I was better off taking my loss and moving on.

IMHO, the current economic news is not good, and that has not changed since I got out.  If anything it has gotten worse.  I am keeping a close eye on the market, educating myself, and waiting to see what happens next.

As for regrets, I do not envy people who have been lucky, and I consider a lot of people who have made gains in this market to have been extremely lucky.  There has never been a period where the Fed has injected 3 Trillion into the market while Congress passed a stimulus bill for another $2 Trillion.  Anybody who tells you that they planned on that happening is lying.  The current actions of the market are unusual, a sentiment echoed by a large number of experienced investors.  There is no shame in waiting for a good opportunity, or turning down ones you think are poor, as long as it's not fear and fear alone making the decisions.I just sold all my holdings this week. If nothing happens and the market goes up a bit between now and the end of the year, I’m not concerned. However, there’s a reasonable chance that Covid surging causes big volatility in the market and I have an opportunity to come back in at a 30% or more discount.

If nothing extraordinary happens, I’ll get back in after hopefully a more sane president is in office.Oh man that sucks why would you sell when you are down 30 to 40 percent ? I get scared to buy but why not just hold and tough.it outYep, I'm not opposed to market timing. But I really only move 5-10% away from my ideal portfolio allocation.Even with its recent run-up, BRK B has no reason to be this cheap.What do the February prices have anything to do with analysing a stock.

Focusing on past prices is just probably going to lead to anchoring biasAnd not tourism or travelSuch as?So you're going to let others pick stocks for you and then pick those they deemed not as valuable?Why?Big banks it isIn March, I was like let me get out before I actually make a loss and I will go back in if it dips more - It never did or even came close to the low of  that day.

I had invested in 2016 mainly in Tech and was up 40% in Feb 2020, I had never planned to cash out as I did not need that cash yet. But I do not know what took over, I panicked in the middle of the night and instructed to sell.

Now I have same level of cash I had back in 2016 with most of my earnings erased in March . If I go back in now and there is a dip I would be so livid, I can wait for longer and see how the elections plan out? 

If I go back in, I will not cash out unless absolutely necessary - 10 years?I'm in almost the exact same position and decided to go extreme value investing today and buy shares that are based on actual real world value. In this case today I purchased about 15% of my portfolio in BRK.BFeds are giving out loans, buying corporate bonds and etc. basically stock market is strong because people don’t think corporations can fail whether profitable or not. So sentiment is that if the corporations can’t fail when they are not profitable then they must go to the moon once they are back to be profitable. Can’t lose.Yup - i am hating myself for doing that so many times - March, April, May & June!I have been - the market has become immune to it..literally even VIX is going down steadily.I was up 12% on my investments at the time and feared going negative. I regret it very deeply....just lost on what to do now.Whoa we got a real investing genius here.🤞50kWe can't easily predict geopolitical tensions, however election years do tend to be good years for stock markets overall.    19 of the last 23 election years were up years for the stock market.     I think those in power want to keep that power and the best way to do so is having those who make money to continue to have money.   

There's still some nice investments you can make in the tech sector which is doing quite well.  The PS5/Xbox X are coming out.   Even if Covid doesn't go away those are going to sell quite well, probably even better because of Covid.Lesson learned!cannot trade on my ISA account in UKThis makes no sense?Yes - just going to invest in Funds rather than specific stocksYou get what you paid for./r/investing doomsday shills have cost the readers here a fortune.  Perhaps that was by design.[deleted]I'm in this boat, however I went cash in summer of 19 and when the end of March 2020 arrived, I figured we were looking at a swoosh or L recovery.  C'est la vie, you win some (I missed the crash of March) and you lose some (I missed the recover after March)

For me, I'm waiting to see what happens in the US after July 26.  A lot of support is at risk of getting ripped out from under those who lost jobs.  Yes, the stock market != the real world economy, but I think if that support goes, there will be a downturn in the markets, at least temporarily.  Beyond that, with multiple vaccines in the pipeline and oceans of liquidity from the Fed, I won't wait as long to get back in this next time, but will be "all weathering" my portfolio.Don't be in a rush to get in. This market is bonkers inflated unless you're willing to take a gamble on the beaten down industries, which is pretty much everything except tech. If you look at the indices they are highly concentrated in a few names. 49% of the NASDAQ is in 6 companies. There is no diversification there. 25% of the S&P is in the same names. These are concentration levels not seen since the dotcom bubble.

Everyone thinks they're smart when the trade narrows and prices get bid up when someone wipes their ass the right way, but you'll never hear from them if things go pear shaped.

Don't chase the trade unless you're going to try and time your exit. Profit is made on the sale, not the hold. No one here has made anything unless they are out of the market.

There are a lot of cheaper names to pick up, but again you have to take the recovery risk. And they absolutely could/will get cheaper. There are expensive names to pick up, but you have to ask yourself when will the euphoria end and should you try and ride the wave in the meantime even though fundamentals in no way support their prices.

It's a shit market either way. Follow the herd or buy the out of favor? Either way, don't rush in. People think we've had the bear market and it's time for another bull. They are wrong. There is still lots of risk ahead. Consider the last two busts took 18-24 months to bottom. No rush. And if thr market is going to continue higher at this pace, we have much bigger problems. And again, when will you time your exit? Because if you don't you'll be buying at the peak of the largest bubble we've ever seen and your long term returns will almost guaranteed to be shit.

So if you're going to DCA in, take time with your lump sum. Maybe over the next couple of years.RPAR and SWAN are both nicely packaged all-weather portfolio etfs that have a lot less volatility than stocks in general while also having better returns than bonds.... and the vast majority of retail traders make less money the more trades they make. maybe “you can’t time the market” should be replaced with “you are overwhelmingly likely to underperform if you try to time the market”$ZM $420Been thinking this when the market was 12% lower then today. I think market will even go higher, so I got long positions, but covered them with a small put warrant and got cash enough to spread my buys.. tbh there are too many regular people discussing the stock market. Meaning it’s time to stay away. When everyone wants stock you want to sell. Timing is the biggest X in the whole equation.That doesn't mean that its going to go down? It means that money is performing the job it was supposed to. Stop Gap until eventually activity returns to normal, which on the news of the oxford vaccine yesterday will likely be sooner than later so people are rushing into any undervalued equities that are left.Then buy some bonds and dca the rest.

(Probably) cry when you realise that the next dip doesn't even come as low as today.

Disclaimer: am a r/wallstreetbets subscriberAmateur traders don’t move the market mate, they just ride the waves.Most forget to keep cash aside for these dips.I was poorly trying to time the market.. I had waited so long and the market just kept going down. Originally I was going to pull 50% out of the market in late Febraury but I decided against it. I figured I'd cut my losses, switch to cash. Wait to see if the market would tank further so that I can re-enter at a better price.. But then the J.Pow printer ramped up and now we're here.

> Edited because I used a banned word that starts with a B and ends with an rrr..Being absolutely honest - I started investing back in 2015, no clue just bought some tech funds/ developed countries equities and some EM funds. I never looked at them as I was busy with work etc. 

Fast forward to Feb, I checked my portfolio and said I will leave it alone (I do not need the cash), I was up 40%. Then the drip began, I had some tiny amount of cash at the time and I bought a bit more tech funds, then it kept falling and falling, it reached to a point where I was just 12% up (over 5 years) and I was like I rather cash out now as its going down and I will buy more when its lower. I did zero research (i only started on reddit after the crash) - in the middle of the night I woke up and I instructed to sell everything (with zero logic) and f'ckd myself. Worst is I could have just bought the next day (it was only up 2%) but I believed it will drop more. More worse is that on March 31 some of the funds were close to the same price as March 23 and I did not react, again being stubborn that it going to fall more (looking at history and reading articles that the bottom is not in)

Anyways, I tried to make quick money but lost more with Oil and VIX - so I have decided those are not for me to trade. I just belong in funds and that's it.

I think I will start DCA when I see a small correction, until then IMHO.[removed]I started buying again after taking a break the past few weeks.  It looks like we will have the vaccine available to the masses by January.  This is a hated bull market rally and general sentiment is bearish but the trend is up.  Its not just US money piling into US equities - international investors have also been buying and there is a lot of cash floating around looking to park their cash.  I would love for there to be at least a 10% pullback but if all this bad news is unable to bring the stock market down, I'm not going to fight the trend or the FED.What if it goes up 10 or 15 percent, I learnt to keep holding (never sell ) and keep buying when a good oppurtunity arises . Up around 170 percent in under 5 years . What seems expensive today looks like a great buy 5 year later especially forstable  mega cap techI don't market time to jump in and out of the market, but I think it is prudent to let valuations inform allocations. I'm a few years from retirement, conventional wisdom is that I should be 30% - 50% stocks, because valuations seem high I'm on the low end of that scale. I don't consider that market timing at all.I added to my position a month ago. Those businesses are cash-generating machines, even if investors got spooked when Warren dumped his airlines. I expect significant recovery to come. Tons of cash for stock buybacks or another acquisition if the opportunity presents itself.It's just a screen to check which stocks could be potentially undervalued and which haven't been pumped up by the recent bull run.RaytheonIndustrial sector still has some great choices, especially in the defense industry.>So you're going to let others pick stocks for you and then pick those they deemed not as valuable?

Where did I say that I let others pick stocks for me, particularly those that other people have deemed not valuable?What are the alternatives?

FOMO into growth stocks? Buy commodities or (lol) bonds? Just keep everything in cash? None of the other options seem attractive.I know you want to go funds but to be honest, even at these valuations for a lot of companies the risk is to the downside. Tech is the way, but even then only a portion of the tech market. The behemoths. Massive books. Huge industry moats. Giant scale. Those are probably the only ones you sound like you can sleep at night with in your portfolio. Sure they are expensive. But you’re paying a premium for less financial risk.Sounds like u need a financial advisor (check for those that is a sworn fiduciary or smth)In terms of getting back in, I was in a similar position to some extent and ended up going into mutual funds that performed well over the past 6 months as well as in the long term. The hope being that if there is another corona related crash, these will be the ones that again recover more quickly, and if not, then they're good funds to be in anyway.I put about 5% of my cash into HBI 2 weeks ago. (similar to you going for value) I have FOMO, but thusfar I'm not in a huge rush to get back in to being fully invested.> So sentiment is that if the corporations can’t fail when they are not profitable then they must go to the moon once they are back to be profitable

They they are already 'at the moon' (Late 2019 prices) when they were doing just dandy.

Why would they go beyond the moon, if they just barely survive, indebted, with Fed help?

Labored analogy: Your grandad was doing great, but getting a bit old.  BAM ... he gets hit by a bus; everyone thinks he's a goner ... they get ready for the funeral.    Yet the doctors save him, and now he's in the ICU hooked up to every imaginable machine  - *beep beep beep*.  That's the market today.  There's no reason to imagine grandad will jump out of bed and be a young man of 30.Have at it then. Good luckStart buying in little by little. Go for value and hope for a pull back on the stocks that have run up. It’s hard to time the market. Buy stocks you don’t mind holding for a few years.What’s wrong with going negative? If you can’t handle at least -30% from deposited money then stay away from stocks... 

Actually S&P500 last 150 years statistics helps a lot, to take it easier.If you’re up 12% year-to-date, I wouldn’t beat yourself up too bad. The s&p 500 just went positive for the year. You’re ahead of the game. I have a buddy who got into some financial trouble in mid January. He cashed his whole 401k out, I mean very penny of that thing. I gave him so much shit. Then came March. He didn’t look so dumb then. Your choice wasn’t so bad.Thats trivial compared to what you will make over 20 years. Dont worry about it. You have missed out on a bit, but nothing to take too seriously.If you are putting that kind of money in the market, you have decide if you are a trader or a long term investor or something in between after figuring out if you need the money in the next 10 years. Assuming you got all your other bases covered (emergency fund, debt, income, savings rate etc)

If you are a long term investor, then it makes sense to buy, add more during dips and major corrections. This is really a small amount in the larger scheme of things 20 years out. 

so if I were you, I would

1. Determine if I need this money in the next 10 years. If no,
2. How much new money I can save for investing every month (let's say X)
3. I would scale in 5K + X every month into the market.

That's just me. Got to be in the game to win the game.Good points, though my theory is based on "ItS DifFerReNt ThIs TiMe" considering all of the current instability.  

Yeah people are gaming much more now I can imagine, thank you for the advice.You either pay upfront or later, but there’s no such thing as a free lunch.50 pesos?"Now that you've learned not to time the market, you should probably time the market"The real problem is that those people have no patience. Including myself.I can’t see stimulus lasting long enough until this is all over. The only reason those 10% unemployed are impacting the economy is because the government borrowed money to give them $600/week.

So what’s the potential upside?I’m not sure the opportunity cost even makes it worth it to do that. The other school of thought is that cash aside is cash that could have been earning dividends and not waiting for a dip.Honestly, without the printer this would be a very different market.  Even with it might still roll over.Honestly, you got out with a profit, which is good.  Nothing wrong with cash.  Otoh, if you're doing it out of fear then maybe time to put it back into some indexes and forget it.Your submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

I am seeing too many people state they will hold out until the side effects can be reasoned vs. its effectiveness.I wouldn’t call it a hated bull market. I would call it a bull market diverged from reality. People don’t know how to make sense of the market because it doesn’t seem to respond logically to earnings or the macroeconomy. The only way to make sense of it is to say that quantitative easing and low interest rates are causing a never ending rally. If that is the prevailing opinion, then my opinion (not really my opinion but the one I believe) is that there is no way it is sustainable. At some point, there will be a reckoning.   What better time for a reckoning than unemployment at a record high, business earnings down significantly, and the most unstable president in the history of the US coming up for re-election. 

You could be right. Maybe the election will come and go without issue, maybe the vaccine will come out sometime in 2021, and maybe the market will continue to rise between now and then. But I’m more than happy to be sitting this one out.It’s possible and I will miss out if that happens. I’ve accepted that possibility and I’m ok with it. Normally, I would totally agree with you but something just isn’t right with this market. It’s detached from reality.  Most of the market feels more like gambling than investing right now.  You might feel comfortable investing, but I don’t. That doesn’t make either of us right or wrong. Just personal preference.True, but avoid certain sectors that are due to have a difficult time ahead such as travel (airlines and cruises). You could probably get a better ROI on holding a general S&P500 ETF than waiting for travel sector to pick back up.I havent looked into the balance sheets but is raytheon in a stronger financial position than lockheed?Wouldn't touch defence until after the election.You mean when Biden wins the election and slashes the defense budget? Don't see it as a wise investment.The price is determined by the market, so not you. And ontop of that you suggest to buy the stocks that haven't recovered yet, so those that others have deemed bad right now. Ergo you let others pick for you.Just because you invest into growth stocks does not mean it is necessarily FOMO. Investing in (tech) growth stocks has by far been the best strategy the last years. Noone knows what will happen in the future though, but the same applies to value investing.I’m not sure on the investment platform you are using but you could play it safe with VOO and use fractional share investing so you don’t have to buy entire shares at once. This way you could just setup a recurring transfer every week and slowly trickle money in to at least see your money make some gains over time. Better then just sitting on the side lines holding liquid.I know - I have no idea what happened to me, maybe it was the media but I f'ckd myself over. I was negative hugely when I first invested in 2015 (August) but I stuck on with it, some of the funds returned 130% in 5 years (tech).

Very expensive lesson learned.he didn't say 12% year to date, he said for the total time in the investment.[removed]If I move the payments back far enough I'll die first.  :)Basically the advice is hold cash that will be negatively impacted by money printing instead of stocks that are being positively impacted by money printing. I swear some people on this sub are more interested in being right about their predictions than making money.You're always timing the market aren't you? Whether you go all in lump sum or DCA, you're timing the market. That's the problem with disconnecting price from the fundamentals. You're more concerned about when to get in versus what you're buying and at what price. Not a good long term strategy.Fair, thats really what is holding everything in the balance.

The one thing I would say is that a lot of those unemployed weren't participating in the market anyway and made up proportionally less of the spending than those unaffected. I also think there is a influx of people with more spending money who made out like bandits in the market during this time. Anyone who has auto buying set up on their equity purchases and just left it alone every paycheck is sitting pretty.If you don't have cash on the side you can't take advantage of the corrections.My cash is mostly coming from a position I sold that imo had enough return. Then keeping that cash for new opportunities. Sometimes that cash stays longer in the cash account then other times but I always TRY to keep +- 15 to 20% cash for opportunities. Sometimes I miss out, sometimes you guess right. Risks that come with the “game” right..Unless Bernie Sanders, Ron Paul, or AOC are on the ballot, defense should be fine.Two things are certain in life: death and military spending of the US.If you truly believe that America would create an entire new branch of the military, and then go on to cut funding just because a Democrat becomes President, then you have a point.  I just don't see it that way, especially since a lot of the contracts have already been given out to the likes of LMT, NOC, RTX, LXH, GD, and BA.

If nothing else, bet on LMT, the entire world is buying up F-35s to the point the company has billions of dollars worth of production in their backlogs.  The U.S. Armed Forces are not the only buyers for these companies.Biden ain't gonna cut sh!t.By this logic, purchase of stock for any other reason is also "letting others pick for you" since every stock purchase is informed in some way by its current price.Sure, but not right now. OP was asking what to do right now, where the market, particularly tech growth stocks, have been pumped to high heaven.While you did make a mistake, you weren't alone.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*If you receive a lump sum and then immediately invest it, I would argue that you're not timing the market (as the barrier that prevented you from entering the market earlier was possession of funds, not market status)So what do you suggest? Never buy in until the market drops 30% again to "fair" values which may or may not happen?However on the other end if you have cash on the side you're not taking advantage of growth and only losing money to inflation.Holding cash until a dip performs worse than simply lump sum investing cash into the market as it becomes available, historically.
https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-a-buy-the-dip-stock-market-strategy-is-inferior-to-buy-and-hold-2017-05-22Not necessarily. I have an 80/20 stock/bond portfolio and when the initial crash happened my bonds were up heavily, so my portfolio was more like 70/30. So then I sold some bonds and bought some stocks to bring it back to 80/20.See I think you do yourself a discredit by saying you keep cash on hand. To me that to me implies stale cash, cash sitting idly waiting for that big dip. Sure you are likely feeding new cash in to the account from outside your investment portfolio and it may sit there for a small period. To me the difference is you have setup a return strategy on an investment and once that has been fulfilled, you release and prep for another investment.

I say bravo!In 2024 - "We've successfully defunded the police. Now it's time to defund the military"And how do you know they are pumped to high heaven? Seriously, noone has a clue. Your advice is as good as any other. I was just curious about your though process.You've made the decision to go all in. You've timed the market because you presumably now think is a good "time" to buy.Buy good companies at good prices regardless of what the market is doing. Don't blindly buy just because.>only losing money to inflation.

Which I think is the idea behind having a certain % held in bonds. Bond values go up when interest rates go down, which (usually) leads to an inverse relationship with the stock market.You're assuming price doesn't matter. I don't think that's a good assumption.That's assuming an all or nothing approach. I'm not saying that. Why does no one on reddit seem to understand buying at lower prices is better than buying at higher prices? It's incredible.That's why you buy bonds. That been said it's unfortunate that your country offers shitty yield on bonds that's no different than cash but that's just Fed being Fed. Other counties offer yield on bonds which are high enough to beat inflation.

10 year bonds at near 5% in India for example. That makes it a good candidate for proper rebalancing.

When valuations are right buy stocks.. when valuations are whacky then buy bonds.. when valuations correct then sell those bonds and buy stocks. It's quite simple really.Right. You "cash"ed out of bonds and bought more equities. That was your cash. You had to sell something to buy something. You timed the market. It was based on a formula you wanted to maintain, but you timed the market based on price movements.Doesn’t always work out the way I intend though lol, but I will take the bravo as I know you know where I am coming from ;)This is why don’t vote blue, bunch of radicalsDon’t try arguing with this guy. There are a lot of people who are using shitty metrics like P/E right now and are convinced buying tech is “FOMO” and valuations are too high. I can’t wait for a few years from now when buying Apple for $400 sounds like a dream>And how do you know they are pumped to high heaven? Seriously, noone has a clue. 

Trading at several times their historical P/E ratios, PEG ratios, etc., if they're even making any money at all, is an indicator that they're pumped to high heaven.Sorry, this is a dumb take. By your logic any investing is timing the market.

Lump sum investing is saying “I don’t know if this is a good time in the short term, but long term it doesn’t matter.” It’s putting your money in ASAP and maximizing time in the market - after all, time in the market is more important than timing the market.You're making the decision not based on market status, but on the studies that indicate lump-sum generally outperforms DCA regardless of time of entryHow does that help? To calculate the return on your strategy, say you invest 50% in the market immediately and hold 50% in a bank account waiting for a correction.

The 50% you held in cash, and then invested on a correction, still performs worse historically than the 50% you invested in the market. Because by the time you waited for a correction you often end up buying at higher prices even after the correction.

That said, the future could certainly be different. But so far holding cash on the side hasn’t shown its worth in recent decades. EDIT: I should say, in terms of total return. Maybe you can make an argument for sharpe ratio or risk adjusted return or something.> That's assuming an all or nothing approach

No it’s not, the portion of cash you have sitting on the sidelines will historically perform worse than if it were invested. You don’t need to be 100% cash for that to be trueToday's high prices are tomorrow's low prices, though.The important point here is that there's no emotion or ambiguity involved. Just "if your allocation is out of whack by x%, you rebalance".Wonder why you're getting downvotes. 

This is true. Some people like to say rebalancing is not timing the market, but it is. Same for the reasons people buy bonds. Some say it's "to stabilize a portfolio", no it's to make money on what is essentially cash.Believe me, I've fallen flat on my face too! It is all about of learning, sometimes costly, but we live to fight another day!Or maybe vote based on actual, real issues and not on some random fake quote some guy said on the internetWhen you up over 100% in your stock that had a P/E of 100 and the market corrects 20%, you will barely even care.
They want to dumpster dive based on P/E.  I'll take my chances with my high flyers.No it is not. The same thing applied a year ago.Your logic ignores price. You basically just said buying at any price is a good price. And that's terrible advice.Actually, yes, any investing is timing the market, just on different time scales. Long term buy and hold is a form of timing, but your time horizon is very long. You're just saying that in 15-20+ years, the market in general will be higher (including dividends) than it is now. It's basically the same sentiment as short term investing/trading: you try to identify two points in time, and bet that your investment will be worth more in one point than in the other.

(Dividends help cushion this for the longer term since you'll be generating income that is less sensitive to the market cycles, but still...)If you're going in lump sum you're not DCAing. But it all depends on your cash flow. Is the lump sum small or large compared to your cash flow? If you put in $10,000 at a peak and DCA $10 a month, the DCA won't do shit for your returns. If your cash flow is more material relative to your lump sum then DCAing long term and picking up bigger positions during down markets will help.There was a 13 year period following dotcom where waiting would have earned far superior returns. We had 2, 50% drops. And it didn't happen all at once. The bottoms took up to 2 years to reach. So you DCA'd all the way down and then back up. Twice. That was huge. If you went in all at the top and your DCA was immaterial to your total portfolio then you materially underperformed. These types of trends aren't uncommon either. Look at the history of the S&P 500. I've found 6 periods of 9 years or more of sideways movement from a peak. That sideways afforded great corrections to DCA into.Depends on your time horizon. It took the S&P 500 13 years to break through the dotcom peak. The index, not individual companies. Some companies have gone on to do better, some have never again hit those prices.Indeed. Emotion is the hardest part of investing.Bonds are meant to ensure that you have something when a buying opportunity arises. It doesn't have to be a crash but simply something as simple as buying out a company when you feel it has reached a good valuation during correction.

As the market becomes greedy with extreme valuations leaving little buying opportunity is when you increase your bonds exposure by bringing fresh inflows to buy bonds. When it sees a correction is when you sell those bonds to buy out stocks at decent valuations.

It's not essentially timing the market. You shouldn't buy stocks at valuations that don't make sense.. that's when you buy bonds... like now would be a good time to stay inveated in your stocks while bringing any fresh savings to bonds instead.

Not timing the market.. just being smart by not buying stocks which are obviously overvalued.its not timing the market... you should be rebalancing on a predetermined date, whether the market moves up or down has no effect on whether you rebalance or not...75%+ of the market cap of the big tech names has happened since Trump took office. They all have followed the same price trends. And their fundamentals have not followed. To argue this isn't a tech bubble is to ignore the facts.>No it is not. The same thing applied a year ago.

Yeah, stocks, particularly tech stocks, have been pumped to high heaven for a while now. The theory that makes the most sense to me is that it's a function of the Fed's loose monetary policy driving capital to equitiesIn terms of specific stocks, it’s absolutely terrible advice to ignore the price and valuation. But when it comes to indexes, it really doesn’t matter all that much.Timing the market specifically refers to waiting for certain price points to buy or sell.

If you're automating investments, which is the best advice for consistent returns, you're not timing anything.This flies in the face of historical performance, though. Lump sump outperforms DCA the majority of the time, even more so when the time period is increased.

>In an analysis that covered 1926 through 2015, Vanguard found that an immediate, lump-sum investment outperformed a six-month series of investments 64% of the time. For investments strung out over 36 months, the lump-sum option did better 92% of the time.

https://www.barrons.com/articles/want-to-buy-stocks-now-dont-wade-in-dive-51587115802this must be my stopWrite your actual strategy so we can backtest itSo it's not a traditional timing of the market as some would describe. (which is trying to time small jitters)

But it's still a form of timing, you are buying bonds because you think stocks are high. Which is what everyone did in 2017-2019, and was wrong. In hindsight they were timing the market, wrong.I am neither saying we are in a bubble, neither that we are not. Everyone who claims to know should have an easy time playing the market.[removed]RemindMe! 1 yearThen you're just ignoring the price of the entire index. No difference.You do, it's just that your predicitons are on a broader spectrum. You're not trying to time a market high in a monthly scale, but rather on a decade scale. And not everyone is following certain price points. Most amateur investors just go "oh, the PE is historically very high and the yield curve just inverted, so I expect a correction", and after that "the market dropped 37.4%, which is around the average historical bear, so I'm gonna get back in".That's a bullshit analysis. It compares a one time lump sum versus DCAing that lump sum and never investing another penny. It also assumes you're cashing out. The comment about missing the 10 biggest days of the market materially negatively impacts your return means you're selling on those biggest days not buying. Buying higher doesn't improve your returns.

I did an analysis years ago on the S&P 500 and looked at the difference between investing once a year, once a quarter, or once a month. The conclusion was that the differences were immaterial over long periods, particularly since people don't invest perfectly or even DCA perfectly over long periods. Incomes change. They spend savings on a big purchase. Education costs. Etc.You can't understand basic math?Buy at good prices. That's my strategy.Depends on the risk apetite, if you think stocks are too expensive and risky then bring fresh inflows into bonds.

It's stupid in my opinion to keep buying stocks at any price regardless of the valuations.

It's not timing the market, simply buying bonds when the prices are too high.. like right about now.

Timing the market would be selling your stocks, to buy back later at a lower price.Playing against irrationality has never been easy.

Studies have shown time and time again the best way to invest is to do it automatically and ignore the price. “Set it and forget it.” Because following the price is timing the market. If you can’t understand that, this conversation is pointlesswhat defines a good price for you?Depends on what stocks, I see a lot of undervalued stuff in DOW and covid hurt stocks. I see a lot of overvaluation in fang and Tesla and so on.I am curious: are you in cash or shorting atm?Set it and forget it is following the price. You're buying at any price hoping that someone else will come along and buy at an even higher price regardless of fundamentals. Funny that you can't see the ignorance of your own position.It depends on the company. The industry. Their financials. Growth prospects. There is no magic number and sometimes I'm willing to take a flyer. All situational.I'm buying out of favor, which is pretty much anything but tech. But cautiously because there is still a lot of risk in the economy and I think there will be a material market adjustment. The things I am looking at are still sitting near their March bottoms. Consider the market runup has been very narrow. Most companies haven't participated.>Set it and forget it is following the price. You're buying at any price hoping that someone else will come along and buy at an even higher price regardless of fundamentals.

Yes... that's historically what has happened and the basis for retirement and investing advice. The stock market has given an annualized return of 6-7% over the past few decades. 

I don't understand why you think this is a bad idea.thats helpful to the person you're arguing against lol....What has worked the last few decades won't necessarily work the next few. Lots of things happening now that have never happened before and not for the better. This has all been covered to no end here and in the financial news. I don't think expecting returns of the past is prudent.There are too many variables to wrap up in a simple reddit response. If it were easy everyone could do it and do it well consistently.I'm not willing to have this discussion. It runs contrary to the consensus of people way smarter than you and me, and I'm not informed enough to really argue with you about this. I'm going to continue following and trusting the historically proven consensus advice. Good luck.Soooo, what's your solution then? Wait until you think is a favorable price? The whole point of time in the market is so that you don't miss gigantic bull runs. 

The price of being cautious is missed gains. And why statistically you earn more when you're always in the market. How do you counter the statistics?You're arguing buy at any price because time will save you. I disagree.**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

In short, the airlines expect long-term pain.28% of total is a lot. Must comprise of lots of grandma and grandpas.It's refreshing to see a lot of the elderly folks volunteering for the early retirement package. Few things are as bad in the corporate world than some 70+ year old still clinging on to their job while blocking the younger generations from getting promoted.>More than 2,200 Delta pilots have volunteered to retire early.

IIRC, there's a massive shortage of pilots.  Wonder if China will snap them up, since they've been poaching pilots for a while, and Covid seems be in control there.If they are close to retirement, the company will essentially pay for them to leave, as they would be leaving anyway in a few years. Often times this Is accomplished by incentives such as cash money or other ways.Typically, if you opt in to an early retirement, you are incentivised. Start collecting pension early, or are given full pay for a year, etc. So no, if they opt in, it's usually because they were going to retire in the next few years anyway, but now they can get pain *not* to work. From the companies perspective, they can avoid furloughing employees by accelerating the retirement of people on their way out soon anyway.A mix between incentives and bird in the hand.

Also, can't apply it to this case but in one of the large companies I have dealt with people have routinely left just ahead of pension calculation changes. (So they get a better pension on Dec 31 vs following Jan 1)  So if you are on the edge of "when do I retire" then when things are looking down you take the money and run. 

What if to stay in business part of the negotiation is retirement related?  (Years of service, % of base pay, or even if loss of overtime will kill your calculation). There are a lot of defined benefit retirement benefits floating around.Fear of the virus may be a big factor too.  This may appeal to those that weren’t going to continue on anyway,From the employee perspective I'd say because then they don't need to survive on unemployment if they end up furloughed. They likely expect they can find a new job rather quickly so they'll receive buy out money plus a new income stream and be in a great spot financially. Its a risk though if they can't find another job quickly enough.Getting paid a bonus to leave a company and industry that will likely struggle for years to come or stick with it and hope to god you don’t get laid off anyways come October. Seems like the smart career choice to take the buyout if you can imo.Bird in the hand. Take the package now and cash out, or keep playing and hope you don't whacked for nothing later.or as others have pointed out, jobs that aren't specific to the airline industry.There is no pilot shortage.  There is a pay shortage.Covid took care of that shortage!There was a pilot shortage. Now there’s a surplus.Anyone know what type of pension plan these employees have?  There has to be some massive unfunded pension that translate to significant liabilities.So almost 28% of the employees were near retirement?But what does southwest get out of doing that?  Like why would south west want to pay someone a years salary as an incentive to get them to retire?Which overlaps with older personnelThere also won’t be a pilot or pay shortage for the foreseeable future, sadly. Maybe once this passes.My friend works for southwest and is a baggage agent. He tells me all the time about how many of the older baggage agents whove been there for 10-20 years make well over $100,000. Southwest treats their employees really really good. He gets a 9% matching contribution to his 401K too.It’s probably a significant fraction of the 28%.  The others probably think they can get another job elsewhere, even if outside the airlines, and getting paid to change jobs beats being furloughed or laid off with less severance.

Some of the employees may be clerks, mechanics, machinists, etc where they might not get exactly the same job, have at least a marketable skill that translates elsewhere.It might not exactly be close to retirement age.  Our company offered retirement buyouts for anyone over age 55, which is still a good decade from typical retirement age.They are likely paying them less than full salary, there for it is lower cash payments. 

Also there's potentially accounting advantages which could tie to covenants on Debt.Dont downvote him for asking a questionWatch that in the medical field with older practitionersI would kill to have that 401k match....Top-out pay for a full-time ramp agent is probably something more like $68-70k, though it is possible to break $100k by picking up a lot of extra shifts and being awarded overtime.Another great point. Get ride of one employee that costs 100k and hire a new one fire 50kSo it's like airline is paying generous severance which works if you are able to find a new job.I don't know about accounting advantages but I think its more related to uncertainty of covid for the next 6 months and the airlines want to be able to cut costs for the future months.CorrectYup, precisely.  At my last job I was pissed enough to have taken just about any severance if they had offered it at the time, even though I wouldn’t have been the “target market” for it (I didn’t have the seniority, so they would have preferred to have someone with a higher salary retire).  There could be a mix of that too in the 28%.Old people also don't wanna work and put themselves at risk of getting infected and dying.Valuations are likely too high but article ignores IBM completely botching the PC revolution and simultaneously paying Microsoft for DOS and letting them sell it to others. They literally financed their own down fall.i sort of disagree. the difference now is that the 10 year yield is at 0.6%

at that rate, paying 80x earnings for a company like Netflix is not too bad.> *Big-Cap Tech Stocks Are a Sucker Bet*

So suckers bet?Why is the word "still" in this title? 

They were a suckers be then. Maybe they are now. But in between they were a great place to go for large parts of that period.Tech is a lot different today than the 2000 bubble.  Back in 2000 projections were based on achieving a brand new scale because the internet was here to change the world.  Now the major companies have been determined and support themselves through services, hardware, straight out buying up competition, investing in startups, etc.  The P/Es are still high because that's the nature of tech. We won't know the inventions of the future but I wouldn't bet against an Amazon Apple or Google from having a hand in it.  If you think back to the amount of money these companies have already made their stock holders, it would have been a suckers bet not to hold them.It’s behind a pay wall. 

Anyway. Profits talk for themselves. All the big tech are making incrementally more money year on year. What’s wrong with valuations like this? In a few years you will turn back and say wow it was so cheap then.Valuations are high but seriously, people have just talked themselves into a narrative that all SAAS valuations are just completely untethered from reality. They are fairly valued to a fair bit overvalued. It really depends on the company you're talking about.

People keep talking about shitter companies, but what about the good ones? Atlassian, Twilio, Veeva, etc are all growing 30%+ with 30%+ FCF margins, with contractual stability. Those numbers deserve stratospheric valuations. That kind of shit literally wasn't possible until like 10 years ago. And if you analyze the business, you can see these companies have vice grips on their respective industries.

Some companies are overvalued - people think some companies are going to be Atlassian when they're not going to be. That happens. But in a world where rates are tiny, valuations will be exponentially higher. It's incumbent on PMs or whoever to manage that risk.I don’t disagree, but... Apparently not.I like this quote from the Q2 letter for Vltava Fund.

"Imagine that you went shopping in your supermarket and you were greeted by a large sign “Prices don´t matter.” Would that seem normal to you? I think that prices (and fundamentals) always matter."Disagree.    But one thing that is missed on many is how fast some of the big tech companies are still growing even though they now have over a trillion dollar market cap.

Take Google.   Last three years had 18%, 23% and 23% top line growth.  Amazon had even stronger growth but, yes, it is pretty pricey right now.   The other two, Microsoft and Apple also have nice growth and just not nearly as strong as Google and Amazon.

Out of the four companies and over the last three years they only had one decline.   Apple in 2019.

But they have also barely got started.   More industries will be taken over by big tech.  Look at things 20 years ago.  Big tech had nothing to do with advertising and now today the industry is owned by Google and Facebook.

You will see these big four eat up more and more industries.   A big one will be transportation.    There is only one company capable of

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6lIhMRe6wQ

But it is not a car company today.  Then there is shipping/logistics that will also go full automation at some point. 

Then there is the fact that AI/ML will more and more be critical to more and more industries.What is it with IBM honestly, pretty much for the last 30 years people have been talking about this particular company completely bottling it.


Heck, there's an email exchange in the 90s between Buffet and a Microsoft exec (forgot his name, he later became president of the gates foundation for a while) where they mention IBM missing out on the the tech trend at the moment.


It's like any example of large cap incompetence can be attributed to IBM

I guess credit to them for not having much outright fraudGreat example of why the stock market is disconnected with the economy and expected growth. So much liquidity supplied to banks and their customers, they need a place to park their cash. They put it where they feel is the safest bet with the highest yield which is big tech. The game can keep on going though as long as we don’t hit stagflation and rates remain low.Agreed that near-zero yields lead to somewhat unique circumstances. I'm personally bullish on equities. Still, it did feel somewhat alarming to be reminded that quite a few of the names he mentions there substantially grew their business over the next decade (CSCO, QCOM) without creating much shareholder value. You could easily substitute some of those names with TSLA, etc.Meanwhile, value stocks with their 10x P/E...I think an extra 0.6% return for an equity over 10YT is not enough of a safety margin given the risks. 40X is reasonable but I would still be keeping a close eye for corrections.Their "earnings" however are hardly that.  Their earnings (except for the last two quarters) are from borrowing."History has shown that whenever companies, no matter how great, get priced above 50 to 60 times earnings, buyer beware."

ZM is 82 price to salesThanks - was going to link this but wasn't sure if it agreed with the sub's rulesTbf, the author wasn't talking about the broad market index - he was specifically referring to big-tech (at the time) companies with P/E ratios over 100x. 

&#x200B;

> But many of today's investors are unfazed by history -- and by the failure of any large-cap stock ever to justify, by its subsequent record, a P/E ratio anywhere near 100. As the chart nearby shows, of the 33 stocks (18 tech and 15 nontech) that have a capitalization over $85 billion today, an incredible nine currently have P/E ratios in excess of 100, and six of those are in the top 20. 

I don't think QQQ or SPY properly refute his argument, since A) ETFs are regularly rebalanced which removes losers and rewards winners; and B)the ETFs include a broad array of firms that fall outside the scope of his argument. [Here's a back-test](https://imgur.com/aFihd56) with only the companies that he specifically mentions.

This article was written at the peak of the dot-com boom, and he appears to have called it.

I'm not convinced the article is alarmingly appropriate today - I'd need clarification on that.Yes, because you are comparing it at a very high level. You would look very smart in 2000 as well if you only considered the top.When are they not a great place to go? Seemingly no one can say.Agree with this - 2000 was about what it might be, 2020 is what it is going to be... but that doesn’t take away from all the froth is some tech valuations. I suspect there will be a good amount of consolidation in the next decade and a few shareholders left holding the dud.It's a bit hard to put a price on things that are 99% terminal value though isn't it?

While it's true price matters, price matters 'more' for value stocks and 'less' for growth stocks due to the inherent uncertainty of the value of the growth. Using P/E, P/B, P/S multiples is kind of useless isn't it?

I think it's kind of funny seeing all of these 'value' investors clamoring that they don't understand how tech stocks aren't collapsing when they're seeing huge decreases in ad spends for these companies (20%+), when a single or even three year decrease is nearly irrelevant to the value of these companies.Since the '70s traders have said the following of IBM:

Bill? /sGo read Computer Wars: The Post-IBM World by Charles Ferguson, 1993. It explains everything. Then you can read Barbarians Led by Bill GatesThe web is essentially dumb terminals to a main frame, same as the PC's before that.  IBM dominated the mainframe market, and still does.  As such the face a very real problem of cannibalizing their own market.  See Eastman-Kodak with digital cameras, Xerox with the GUI, and likely Ford/GM with the electric car.I feel like it's important to point out that it's possible for money to flow into equities while valuations for expensive firms fall.To that end, I think there's a missed opportunity when discussing the possibility of a cold war with China (for example) or really any large-scale reemergence of nationalist ideologies that stifle growth for these massive tech companies. How much of the inflated value of, say, Netflix, is based on their ability to grow indefinitely into a market like China?I can see your point on tesla. I think the enthusiasm there is that they have basically cut the cost of an electric car in half in the last 5 years. 

With autonomous and future reductions in battery costs, they could be one of the largest companies in the world with great margins. 

I do agree though that there could be a lot of competition and that this could be an amazon in 1999 type situation. (I am not long tesla)Can you name a good value stock with a 10 PE ? At least half my portfolio is at less than a 10 PE if you look 3-5 years out, but most "value" stocks have no earnngs visibiltythe thing about netflix is that in many of their markets, they are only 20-30% market share. Their margins are also extremely low in those countries. they will be at 30-40x in a few years and likely at 20x in the future with growth and margin expansion.

in contrast, a company like altria could have fast lower earnings 5-10 years from nowI don't think you understand how their accounting works for content acquisition. 

I don't think that paying for original content is a cash expense that should be incurred when the cash leaves. I also think funding it with debt is a smart way to fund content investment.

If you have an argument for why their accounting elections are fraudulent, please enlighten me. For now, it is crystal clear that their investment approach has been exceptional over the past 20 years.

No TV network has produced as many great television shows as they have in the past 5 years.And you know everyone is playing with stop losses.

It even outs a lot of the randomness that occurs from single stocks, and removes a lot of really odd cases in tech of greatly out performing stocks (amazon had a pe of over 500 on many instances since 2006, would this have been a horrible buy?). I also would personally love to hear why P/E is a good metric for this, or why you think the system is the same enough to be able to equate then and now.   


This is not to say price does not matter, I doubt anyone here will argue that you should be careful with the price you pay for a security.\>  outrageously valued stocks   


That is what I was getting at. PE is a bad metric let alone an arbitrary number like 100. Should you pay 100x PE for PG, no. Should you pay 100 PE for tech? Probably not, but that is more a case by case basis.   


Also do not pay 100 PE for pets.comAt the time you couldn't find a SINGLE analyst that didn't rate CSCO a strong buy.  Reminds me of AMZN.To be fair, that isn’t including reinvested dividends. The total return is a little bit better / less bad once that is factored in.Given the benefit of hindsight, when that article was published they weren't a great place.Normal economic downturns that don't force tech to become more valuableYour reasoning as you describe it, regarding tech stocks, has one big issue, which is that can apply regardless of the price. If tech stocks were to be 1,000x the current price, it still applies. A lot of people think using that reasoning, but at root it becomes a justification for what is fundamentally gambling. Or do you disagree? Is there a maximum price that you would pay to buy these tech stocks and how do you determine what that is? Actually, if you can answer that question, you are halfway to answering the broad question of how to value tech companies (the other half is to determine the minimum price that you would sell at). But if you can't answer that question, then on what basis are you investing that isn't "bigger fool theory"?Googling the origins of this term it seems to originate from selling strangles, which really isn't relevant at all - this simply implies that people were mis-estimating volatility. Also, many people following this advice got blown up.Well I thought this was funny...Lol, Jeff Raikes

[https://www.tilsonfunds.com/BuffettRaikesemails.pdf](https://www.tilsonfunds.com/BuffettRaikesemails.pdf)IBM was hurting in the early nineties but came back pretty good starting around 1995 if I'm not mistaken...It is, right now I think it highlights the fear and uncertainty that people have. They legitimately are worried about what’s happening in the economy. They feel safer placing their money in big tech despite valuations because those are the companies they expect to make it out of the pandemic with the least damage or profiting from the change in consumer behavior. I personally think the liquidity will make its way to other areas of the market, but money will keep flowing into tech If people are fearful. Unless we hit an unexpected bump in the road that brings into question the governments ability to backstop the financial economy, I don’t see high valuations coming down anytime soon.I hold Altria which has a P/E of 9 or so.It's a joke. Because tech stock investors have all kinds of justifications for their rich valuations, but the same reasons that should apply to the entire stock market somehow don't apply to out-of-favor value stocks. The 10-year yield argument applies to all stocks. Investors use those justifications (in favor of tech/growth or against value) to rationalize their investing decisions.Wells Fargo?I’m not much of an earnings man but I’d say VW, BMW? Dell is a special situation play at 10 p/e. Discover have relatively decent visibility in the future.NFLX is a stock I will not understand. The only thing it differentiates on is original content and maybe its platform. I don't think it's overly special as a platform and believe competitors will catch up. Its original content is decent, but why does that put a huge multiple on it? It's just a media company at that point. 

It's highly competitive, and any non-original content will just be bid up to a slim profit margin when renewals are put in place.I didn’t say they had any fraud in their accounting.  I’m merely pointing out that they have negative free cash flow.

I don’t think their catalog will be as valuable in the future as many think.  There will be so much new content continually in the future that I don’t think folks will go back and watch the old shows like people do with Friends and Seinfeld today.  I could be wrong, time will tell.>I think it is completely fair to use a s&p and nasdaq as a proxy for his argument.

It is not because it's not at all what he's arguing. He isn't saying the broad market index is overvalued, he is specifically talking about individual firms. 

> (amazon had a pe of over 500 on many instances since 2006, would this have been a horrible buy?).

This is an example of hindsight bias. Retrospectively, obviously Amazon looks like it would have been a good buy, but the question is whether it was a good buy given the information available at the time. If you werent anticipating AMZN transforming into the largest cloud platform provider in the world, it might not have - or, you would have been incredibly lucky.**I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**

I think you have to determine what you think a future state of the company could look like and discount it back today and calculate the various IRRs at different price levels. You can probably also throw some additional upside in for things you haven't even considered in the tech world if you're very confident in mgmt/the product (AWS for example in the case of Amazon).

It's ultimately some question of TAM/years to get there/mkt share. There's certainly some competitive risks that a lot of value investors are pointing out, but I think competition is lower in software than hardware because it's significantly harder to catch up in software vs. industrials.How would “sell the 180’s” be a strangle position?  Its a short call position.I try to refrain from making jokes on this subreddit, but this one was too easy lolThey never came back. People were predicting them to collapse and disintegrate like Data General, Honeywell, CDC, or Wang. The surprising thing was when they held the ship. But they were never the 1970s IBM, that's not coming back.

You can compare the two perspectives. Look at the 1981 text by Sobel, IBM, a Colossus in Transition and compare it to the fumblings with the pen computing craze as documented in Jerry Kaplan's Startup from 1994.

They sold off their Aptiva and Lenovo lines and the 90s had a bunch of failed products like the IBM Simon.  They never got their stuff together, but somehow never lost the farm. Their latest debacle, the Power Series CPU, which is actually 35 years old, on a price/performance ratio, is behind AMD, Arm, and Intel. It sits around Oracle's Sparc.

They have a few super-computer contracts with it but I've only met 1 serious person about a Power series workstation, at a linux conference, probably about 6 years ago ... that's it ... other offerings like Z/OS, MVS, and AIX ... these are like seeing endangered species. Super rare.Neither do I. I'm also very bullish on "the cloud," as I think we've only barely scratched the surface of what's possible when it comes to data.I'm just saying, the reason why the PE is low is that investors seem to expect earnings declinesI don't think it completely applies. Because companies like Square have long and potentially multi-decade runways, lower interest rates have a big effect on value.

In contrast, a lower quality and potentially declining business such as Wells Fargo has been hurt by the pandemic.If you look at Wells Fargo, their efficiency ratio is rising. This suggests that customers are leaving, and that online banking is posing more of a threat.

If you look at companies like Bank of America, the PE doesn't look to good in light of the squeeze on Net interest margin that is coming.I think VW and BMW might be beaten down. For now, the market seems to be pricing in either autonomous or massive growth in market share for tesla.

I really don't have a clear picture on where the electrification roadmap will be 10 years from now.

Dell is interesting because of the VMWare spinoff, I don't know about the hardware business, but it could be a decent cigar butt if the enterprise value is low enough.in my opinion their moat comes from the fact that they have the largest subscriber base. this allows them to outbid others on exclusive content. it also gives them more firepower to spread original content investment over a large subscriber base.

their scale and their years of operational data also give them an advantage in bidding for content rights. in my opinion their engineering team and culture around that will not be replicated by the competition.Netflix does not have negative free cash flow, at least over the TSM. Regardless, the reason FCF is so low is because NFLX consistently invests >~3x earnings into content asset additions, which are revenue generating assets. If NFLX were to reduce their spending to pay out dividends it would be at the expense of growth. 

Alternatively, why would we want their free cash flow to be high? FCF should either be paid out as dividends or reinvested into the firm. They're literally reinvesting what would be FCF, it's just being reconciled in OCF.they depreciate the catalog over 4 years. I don't have any reason to believe the content isn't valuable over 4 years. 

their data science team can also determine exactly what the useful life of content is. it is not too difficult to have a reasonable estimate of the present value of content if one knows how many hours are watched and how that engagement translates to retention. 

to suggest that netflix does not depreciate their content accurately is to accuse them of fraud. i don't think their management is committing fraud.\>  This is an example of hindsight bias. Retrospectively, obviously Amazon looks like it would have been a good buy, but the question is whether it was a good buy given the information available at the time. If you werent anticipating AMZN transforming into the largest cloud platform provider in the world, it might not have - or, you would have been incredibly lucky.   


That was the point I was making. PE in this situation tells you nothing of the under lying business. More so in the case of tech where business are able to mess with the E like AMZN was able to.  Hence why I explicitly asked why you think PE is a good metric for this.There’s a lot of stuff here.  

Let’s just start with the CPU “debacle”.  Are you referring to the POWER9?  What benchmarks are you referencing for price/performance?What are your top cloud possibilities?Banks are literally hurt by lower interest rates, so that is a poor example, not to mention that being lower quality or declining is not what is at question.. You say "multi-decade runways" basically referring a NPV or DCF idea and I agree on growth stocks being affected more in this simple model. But value stocks should benefit from lower rates in the same model.I guess we'll see. I think Wells Fargo's deposits have risen each year for like 100 years, with a few exceptions. Maybe this will be the turning of the tide.They do for now, but I think the inherent problem with things like Netflix is how low the switching costs are. There's no contracts like cable TV (though, this can admittedly be switched), and it's hard not to imagine someone makes something that allows you to share/switch memberships easier so you can easily access more content. Maybe everyone ends up owning subscriptions to several streaming services due to laziness, but the only way that happens is if they remain 'cost effective' which takes away the upside from raising prices. 

I think operational data is overstated. It seems pretty common when you talk to VCs/people in the industry that the value of data isn't as great as you'd hope. The first 10% gives you enough to understand the customer.

Maybe engineering and culture won't be replicated, but I'm not sure that can offset what seems like an ok/decent business vs an amazing business. I'm not saying Netflix won't exist in 10 years - I just don't see why it earns the multiple it does vs. something like Disney.Quick question:  How do you think Netflix is currently valuing its non-current content assets?No, now you're changing your argument. You originally stated that his argument could be refuted because index ETFs returned a positive CAGR over the past 20 years. I responded by pointing out that that's a false comparison because it completely misses the point the author was originally trying to make.Any. (Not done by IBM)

Look at The IBM Way by Rodgers, who described iIBM as a  marketing, not a technology firm.

Any analysis would do.I'll sound pretty mainstream, but mainly edge providers and platforms. I think most of the growth will be on the IaaS/PaaS side of things. My portfolio is posted on my profile if you're curious what I hold.not if their earnings are front loaded and declining.Do a simple 10 year before terminal growth valuation and you'll see how sensitive growth stocks are to lower interest rates. If memory serves me correctly, assume terminal growth of 4%, a drop of WACC from 9% to 8% increases npv of a company growing at 20% pa by 30%. By contrast, that effect on a company that has 5% pa growth is just 10 - 15%.The second argument was in support of the first. Namely, etfs are okay to be used because it smooths out issues with selection effects and just pure randomness of companies being good or bad. No one expected IBM, or Intel to be as inept as they ended up being. 

I also pointed out that there might be a Gettier problem occurring cause PE is a really bad metric to use. As I said in the first post no one is going to disagree that you should be wary in the price you pay.It's still yes because lower rate means higher NPV. And since when did value mean declining or distressed business? But of course, you are right if you never say yes.>and I agree on growth stocks being affected moreThe fact that ETFs smooth out selection effects and the randomness of companies being "good" or "bad" is exactly why they aren't a good comparison metric. If you had an ETF of, say, **only** companies that were trading above a 100x PE multiple and didn't re-balance when companies were de-listed or acquired (SM by ORCL for ex.), then I think you'd have a good comparison. 

By using SPY or QQQ, you're including companies with price-earning multiples below the threshold set by the author, which is why I said it isn't comparable - because he is very specifically **not** talking about these firms. 

Whether P/E is a good measurement to use when valuing a firm is irrelevant, since in this case we're only concerned with P/E. 

Also, the fact that IBM & and INTC performed as poorly as they did directly supports the author's argument - namely, that the companies were unable to generate sufficient returns (growth) to meet the expectations of investors.

The companies were as expensive as they were because investors were front-loading expected future growth by bidding up the price. Unfortunately, they weren't able to meet investors' expectations.This is a really good point, thanks for clarifying. Basically saying an index isn’t the same as a stock pick. It keeps the best, i.e misses out on the fallen angels eg Pets.com - or whatever one calls a hot growth stock that goes dud...Jim Chanos has been cast as the “Darth Vader of Wall Street”, the “Catastrophe Capitalist” and the “LeBron James of short selling”. The 62-year-old titan of the $3.2tn global hedge fund industry predicted the downfall of US energy giant Enron almost two decades ago, making a fortune in the process. But the course of true riches, it seems, never did run smooth. On the day of our encounter, Tesla, which Chanos has bet against for the past five years, overtakes Toyota as the most valuable carmaker in the world, leaving him nursing heavy losses. But more about that later.


I am ensconced at Oswald’s, an elegant London members’ club for oenophiles. It’s the first time I’ve set foot in a restaurant in four months. But where more appropriate to interview the short-seller than an antique mirrored dining room in Mayfair, the heart of the European hedge fund industry? It’s three days before “Super Saturday”, when London’s restaurants and bars can reopen. I’ve been granted an exception and am the sole diner. Social distancing would not be a problem here, however. The round tables are generously spaced apart, designed with discretion in mind.


I am to have early dinner — Chanos is to have lunch. He is in Miami Beach, where he has been stuck since the start of lockdown in early March. For our encounter, he has persuaded Prime 112 steakhouse, his go-to place on Friday nights, to allow him to use its private room. When he comes on screen, his air is more benevolent academic than pantomime villain, dressed in a white open-necked shirt and blazer. Chanos likes to present himself as a “real-time financial detective who is incentivised to root out fraud”. Or, more prosaically, a “forensic financial statement junkie”.


To critics, short selling represents the scourge of modern capitalism. Whereas so-called value investors such as Warren Buffett try to buy shares in companies that the market is underestimating, short-sellers such as Chanos seek out overvalued companies. They borrow shares and then sell them, hoping to buy them back later for less. In short, “they are profiting when others are losing money”, says Chanos — and this makes some people uncomfortable.


Chanos is buoyant. A week earlier, one of his largest short positions — the German payments company Wirecard — filed for bankruptcy, after admitting that €1.9bn of its cash probably did “not exist”. This followed a five-year FT investigation into its accounting practices. Chanos’s funds made almost $100m from the trade, according to an investor. He laughs: “It’s bittersweet, Harriet, because short-sellers put up with weeks and months of misery, and you feel good for hours and days.”


Even its detractors acknowledge that short selling, in a normal environment, helps the markets to question conventional wisdom. But a sharper complaint, usually heard from targets, is that short-sellers acting together to sow FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) about a company’s accounting or financial position can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. In the past, investors such as Chanos have moved markets just by revealing a bet against a particular company.


It’s bittersweet . . . Short-sellers put up with weeks and months of misery, and you feel good for hours and days


Chanos happily concedes that he talks frequently to other short-sellers. He shorted Luckin Coffee, once touted as China’s answer to Starbucks, after Carson Block of Muddy Waters encouraged him to look at it. (The company is now being investigated for accounting fraud.) But it’s “a myth” that short-sellers act together, he tells me from Prime 112’s private room. “If there were conspiracies, we’d be in something much more profitable than short selling.”


I mention Canadian insurer Fairfax Financial. It sued a group of hedge funds, including those run by Chanos, Dan Loeb and Steve Cohen, for allegedly driving down its stock under a short selling scheme. “That was the perception, but it wasn’t true,” says Chanos. “The case was thrown out [in 2018] on jurisdictional grounds. Our allegation was that the company was overstating their earnings, and during the process they restated their earnings.”


Chanos’s hedge fund manager Kynikos Associates is named after the ancient Greek word for “cynic”. His pitch is that he can identify corporate disasters-in-the-making. The New York-based outfit employs 20 people and has $1.5bn in assets under management. Chanos also teaches a course on the history of financial fraud (“how to detect it, not how to commit it”, he quips) at Yale University, his alma mater. The syllabus stretches back to the 17th century. Today, he says, “we are in the golden age of fraud”.

Chanos describes the current environment as “a really fertile field for people to play fast and loose with the truth, and for corporate wrongdoers to get away with it for a long time”. He reels off why: a 10-year bull market driven by central bank intervention; a level of retail participation in the markets reminiscent of the end of the dotcom boom; Trumpian “post-truth in politics, where my facts are your fake news”; and Silicon Valley’s “fake it until you make it” culture, which is compounded by Fomo — the fear of missing out. All of this is exacerbated by lax oversight. Financial regulators and law enforcement, he says, “are the financial archaeologists — they will tell you after the company has collapsed what the problem was.”


All in all, it’s “a heady witch’s brew for trouble”.Post the text of the article it's behind a pay screenI’d like to kindly remind investors on three crucial points:
1) Chanos is long an index and short individual constituents
2) The FED can stay irrational longer than you can stay liquid
3) Long post do not equal good posts.

Last point can be expanded on with one of my favorite quotes: “I can write concise, but sometimes I get lazy and keep on writing.”How much money has Chanos lost on his Tesla short position?[deleted]What a legend.~~Wallstreet~~ Fraudstreet. Yea, we know.Yes sir.Chanos’s mission is focused on understanding a company’s business model and then ascertaining if its financial statements reflect it. Certain themes crop up time and again in his hunt for short positions: technological obsolescence, consumer fads, single-product companies, growth via acquisitions and accounting games. Notably he looks for “legal fraud” — where companies adhere to the accounting rules and regulations but there’s still an “intent to deceive”. Enron epitomised this — Chanos identified that it was using aggressive accounting to front-load profits and hide debt in its subsidiaries.


He wasn’t the first short-seller to the Wirecard party. Chanos initiated a short in the German payments company last year and increased the position last autumn, when the FT published documents indicating that profits at Wirecard units in Dubai and Dublin were fraudulently inflated and that customers listed in documents provided to auditor EY did not exist.


Wirecard’s collapse, when it finally came, was dramatic. But, says Chanos, most fraud is on the edges. And these days, often it is “staring at you right in the face through the use of company-designed metrics” through which they are “gaming the system”. He is referring to creative accounting measures used to flatter companies’ books, notably office-space provider WeWork’s now infamous community-adjusted ebitda. The coronavirus crisis has spawned “ebitdac”, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortisation — and coronavirus — where companies are adding back profits they say they would have made but for the pandemic.


Regulators, he says, could be much firmer in clamping down on metrics “that just are increasingly unmooring themselves from reality”.


Growing up as the son of Greek and Irish immigrants who ran a chain of dry-cleaning shops in Milwaukee, Chanos says he was interested in stock markets at an early age. After Yale, he worked for an investment bank in Chicago and then retail brokerage Gilford Securities, where he began writing research on individual stocks. He had a baptism by fire: “The first major company I looked at and wrote up turned out to be an immense accounting fraud.”


Baldwin-United was a piano company that had morphed into a financial supermarket. Chanos’s research pointed out inconsistencies with its numbers and recommended that investors sell the stock. It went bankrupt the following year, in 1983, at the time the largest-ever US corporate bankruptcy. Baldwin’s collapse piqued the interest of Gilford’s hedge fund clients who followed its stock recommendations, notably George Soros and Michael Steinhardt. “What else does the kid not like?” they asked, Chanos recalls.


Soon afterwards, he joined Deutsche Bank in New York. It was a shortlived affair. In September 1985, The Wall Street Journal ran a front-page investigation into the “aggressive methods” of a network of short-sellers that it alleged was driving down the shares of US companies. The then 27-year-old Chanos was portrayed as an enfant terrible at the centre of the network. “People think I have two horns and spread syphilis,” he quipped in the article. Deutsche fired him and his boss. “The postscript is that nine of the 10 companies mentioned [in the article] either went bankrupt or were prosecuted for fraud,” he says.


Jim Chanos pockets $100m from Wirecard short
Chanos’s wedge salad and my own starter (a plate of oysters, deliciously juicy, with a glass of crisp white Burgundy) arrive.


It must take a certain personality type to be a perma-bear, I venture.


A long time ago, Chanos believed that going short was just “the mirror image of going long”. He has changed his tune on this, however, “because there is a lot of behavioural finance at work in the markets”. On Wall Street, he says, “the bull case is everywhere” — optimistic management projections, takeover rumours that boost targets’ stock prices, and company earnings estimates revised upwards.


“So I think that it does take a certain peculiar personality — and I’ll leave it at that — to say ‘OK, here’s my facts and here’s the conclusions I draw from my facts, and that’s why I think there’s an opportunity on the short side here.’”


Many can’t stomach it. Less than a year after the 1985 launch of Kynikos — amid “the rip-roaring bull market” of the time — Chanos’s business partner declared that he wasn’t comfortable with the pure short selling side of the business. He said his accountant had advised him to sell back his stake to Chanos for a nominal amount of $1. “And I paid him right there on the spot out of my wallet,” says Chanos. “It was the greatest trade I think I ever did,” he adds with a chuckle.


Chanos has put the remains of his salad to one side to make way for the steak. I’m delighted by my main course: deep red toro tuna carpaccio, garnished with avocado mousse.


My guest has one of the best track records in the hedge fund industry. The Kynikos Capital Partners fund, a long/short equity strategy, has gained 22 per cent a year on average over the past 35 years — double that of the S&P 500 index. In the same period, against the backdrop of rising equity markets, its US short-only Ursus strategy — named after the Latin for “bear” — has lost 2 per cent a year.


Kynikos performance chart against the S&P 500 
The past decade has been a difficult one for short-sellers in general, as trillions of dollars of central bank stimulus have lifted prices of assets indiscriminately across the board. How do you trade that? “Very carefully and painfully,” he says.


Fundraising has been tough. Kynikos’s assets peaked at around $7bn after 2008, when short-only Ursus gained 44 per cent, net of fees. They have slumped to $1.5bn since then. This year Chanos sold a minority stake in the management company to boutique investment firm Conlon & Co and the family office of Richard M Daley, former mayor of Chicago.


Prolonged periods of quantitative easing — most recently to ease the economic pain of the coronavirus crisis — is “adding to inequality” by benefiting the people who own financial assets, says Chanos. He believes that the Federal Reserve ought to cut credit card rates for consumers, which are still 15-18 per cent in the US, and sees a potential political backlash against the central banks for their part in how “the rich have gotten much richer and the vast majority of people have not”.

Political risk is one of the reasons that Chanos is shorting gig economy comp­anies such as ride-hailing apps Uber and Lyft and online food-delivery platforms Grubhub and Just Eat Takeaway. Not only are they losing money, but he believes that there is going to be a greater political focus on low-wage workers, which poses an existential threat to their business models.


Chanos sits on the finance committee of US presidential hopeful Joe Biden, who is supporting a new California law to strengthen legal protections for gig economy workers. A Biden administration raises the prospect of higher taxes. “I think it’s fair that rates of taxation on capital probably should go up, relative to rates of taxation on earned income. I know that makes me a communist on Wall Street but I’ve always felt that.”


Chanos declines a second glass of wine, joking that “I don’t want to be drunk for this.” Defeated by his huge steak and salad, he asks the waiter to put them in a doggy bag. On my encouragement, he decides to be a good sport and orders the “decadent” fried Oreos that the restaurant is famous for. My own dessert is a coconut choc ice.


I return to the subject of Tesla, whose shares have surged around six-fold in the five years since Chanos began shorting the company. What is going on here? “I think Elon Musk has personified the hopes and dreams of this bull market,” he says, setting out his bear case against Tesla, which he sees as unprofitable, highly leveraged and facing increasing competition. Tesla “burnishes its results through aggressive accounting”, in his view. He also describes it as “a culture of deception” because it is selling self-driving to consumers, which as yet “doesn’t exist”.


What, I ask, is Chanos’s main motivation: to be rich or to be right?


“I want to do this until they pull me out of the seat,” he replies. When Wirecard filed for insolvency, there was “an electricity” that ran through Kynikos. “That keeps you going.” And so, he says, does his belief that “this market is setting up to be one of the great short opportunities of all time”.

it’s uploaded to doc droid too so you don’t even need to download itThey said the same thing about the 70's. Vietnam War had incurred massive public debts and talk on the street was the dollar was dead. Then Nixon pulled out of the Bretton-Woods system and dismantled the gold standard. Dollar inflated massively in response as the US defaulted on its debts in everything but name. But the G5 came together and agreed to tame the beast of inflation together. Then Reagan was elected and soothed the heart of Wall Street with his supply-side economics. Soon after, Japan brought prosperity to the West with her cars and electronics. The Paris Accord brought dollar inflation again but this time it was intentional.  By the start of Japan's lost decade, America had already begun to usher in the age of the Internet.

Yes things look bleak today as told by the old guard but the normal is always new. We might get negative interest rates but digital currency will dismantle the lower zero bound to accommodate the new rules of money. The Age of Silicon will bring 5G, electric cars, autonomous driving, IoT and quantum computing, keeping growth one step ahead of debt. Renewables and graphene will rewrite the rules of energy. Entire unimaginable industries will spring up on the platform of autonomous driving & e-commerce. Single-aisle planes will cross the globe in one flight, bringing dominance to LCCs. Geopolitical alliances will shift with a world less dependent on oil, ushering in new risks & opportunities. Will the EU consolidate into America's most powerful ally or splinter into many benefactors of the One Belt One Road alliance? Will there be a world war with two hegemons, leaving the victor with all the spoils of war for the next century again? 

The heart of contrarinism is to predict what everyone else is missing. See all the possibilities in your mind, and you will never be surprised. See, I just made a Game of Thrones quote in an investing context.It will also make the dollar weaker on the world-stage making imports more expensive reducing domestic unemployment further reducing welfare and entitlement spending further.

I’ve since removed those extra postsLets say,  lets say, lets say, lets sayI think all these points are correct and i love the sum up of “don’t be the gravy” I have certainly been the gravy before 

— I will say without trying to glamorize it too much — 
An increase of ease and access to equities can be good in current economic conditions (including over phone for people who may not even have a desktop)
— where there is a clear priority to save the shareholders with economic policy and interest rates zero not much to be gained from other financial instruments —- maybe this will help lessen the wealth gap for younger generation if they all grow up trading and following markets. 

Of course options are another part of the storyfinally, someone said it out loud lolI can't wait to read the Michael Lewis book in a few years about the current stock market bubble!Really interesting. As someone who went down the "I don't understand options, but people are making a lot of money" rat hole, I'm glad to see I'm in good company.

Yes we're both still monumental idiots for trading in something we don't understand - but at least we learned from our mistakes.Thank you for posting. 

RobinHood is complete garbage fire in all cases. There is literally no reason to use it unless a real broker won’t open an account with you.I wrote this in another thread:

>On a side note, Robinhood is one of the sadder things that I've seen in investing. The business plan appears to be : "An untapped source of PFOF is the negligible asset investor segment. We will combine a low barrier to entry (paid for with lousy execution / operations / service, and VC money), gameification dopamine kicks, and dubious services to aggregate and convert inexperienced serfs into gambling addicts / attention whores to suck out what little savings that they have so that we can hyperscale and sell the company before FINRA or the SEC shuts us down." It wouldn't surprise me to find out that Robinhood ~~is~~ partly resembles an AUM ponzi scheme where they have to attract new investors at a fast rate to make up for the drop in assets of their customer base.Great article. Trading and gambling is not investing. How many different ways can this be made clear.

I was wrong about Robin Hood when this all started. I thought it would facilitate a way for people to get out of the market faster than ever, faster than any crash since 1929. This is what I expected. Dead wrong. People rushed in. The app jammed up and crashed again and again and people were prevented from leaving the market on big days. The digital stampede has severe lag. Easy to get in, hard to get out. I'm not on Robinhood, but I do watch wallstreetbets like the new Jackass. It's not as amusing now as it was a few months ago. There are too many of them. Just like Jackass, friends started jumping off roofs and it got exhausting. Maybe it's the age. Teens and 20 somethings are more prone to the traps of yolo, fomo, gambling, animal spirits, myopia, debt, everything shitty. Robinhood is a wasp trap. The sugar water is inside, the bottleneck will kill you.Hard to argue access to equities trading will lessen the wealth gap when these kids are learning all the wrong lessons and becoming traumatized such that they never learn how to invest in a prudent manner. For a majority of them the market is just a casino where you go double or nothing based on a hunch. Options are just a tool, there are plenty of practical, reasonable ways to deploy options as part of a larger strategy... these people just don’t know how to do that because they sign disclosures without actually reading or understanding.Most people get subpar returns when it comes to investing. 

Wealthy people are smart enough to index and use asset allocation, stuff that works well with large sums of money. 

If the average person tried that then they would still never catch up because the returns are proportionate to your dollar investment.

This means for people to lower the wealth gap through investing then people with less money have to take on more risk per dollar invested to get higher returns than the wealthy.

But again, as we know most people aren't exactly the best at managing risk or know their tolerance to it, react too quickly and too drastically to headlines, and overall react on a shorter timeline than necessary for things like single equity investments to work out; holding for a few weeks/months when they should be holding for a year at least.

This leads to the lower performance and doesn't really allow for wealth inequality, on a large scale, to be solved.The wealth gap is important but what’s most important is the access to wealth. When I started it was $7 trades and a $500 min to start. And at the time that was a low barrier of entry. But it still made it difficult for people of lower income to invest in stocks because the fees will destroy their low value trades. It did benefit me though because I learned to hold stocks longer and it helped me narrow my picks instead of buying a bit of everything I liked Willy nilly. Today with no fees it really does level the playing field for low income investors. Will most of them suck? Probably. But that’s because a lack of education, lack of guidance from other wealthy people and sometimes just a lack of intelligence not because a lack of opportunity. The chance to do it is more important than the outcome. For now. There will inevitably be bright kids who build wealth and move out of poverty or low income family cycles because of a low barrier of entry into the stock market now days.If education and guidance were determinants of trading success, Goldman Sachs would have done better over the last decade.> IAC trades at a discount to asset value (cash + their publicly traded stake in ANGI) despite having an incredible track record of value creation. I can’t help but wonder if there’s some type of opportunity there; if the market is going to get excited about SPACs predeal and price them at a premium to cash value, why can’t IAC (and other companies with big cash balances) take advantage of that? It seems like it would be pretty easy: IAC could IPO a SPAC tomorrow. They could put $100m of their own cash into the SPAC (some into the founders shares, the majority just into normal SPAC units) and then raise as much capital from new investors as they could. That would create massive value for IAC: it would increase their war chest for deals, it would be (at worst) value neutral for their cash (at best, if the SPAC traded for a premium to cash, it would create some temporary value), and it would create huge economics for IAC (I’m assuming IAC would be the sponsor /founder and get the founders shares, so when they announced a deal they would capture tons of value for themselves). 

So the take away from his (lots of incorrect) rant about SPACs is that one of his "value" holdings should take advantage of the bubble. WeirdBrienne of Tarth completely destroys the arguments of the author, but thanks for sharing.Pretty sure this guy is wrong on the 20% piece he states. This guy assumes that companies are being bought with all cash (ie no debt) or no other partners in the deal. SPACs don't buy companies equal to the size of the IPO proceeds, it's 2-4x that amount, which dilutes the equity that management would get.IAC is great. Quality management and continually proving they execute. Trying to work out what to do post MTCH split still. All back into IAC?I want to create a SPAC and buy in-n-out. Who is down? Jk, but kinda hope Ackman is looking at that or someone. 

And yes i know, in-n-out is gonna say no.Are shareholders in the SPAC not equally diluted though?When SPAC’s take out debt and other PIPE financing are they only diluting management’s portion? I assumed the whole structure got diluted equally so management would still end up with their 20% cut. 

Not an expert on these by any means.I don't really follow this, can you explain?

I though it worked like this. Management pays like $25k and gets 10M founder shares. IPO investors pay $10 a share for 40M shares. 

At the time of the acquisition management shares are converted into regular shares, so shareholders now get diluted by that 20% amount? 

Why would leverage effect the situation, wouldn't all shareholders (including management) be affected the same way?IAC is my largest position now. Time will tell if this works out. I like them too.Haha, Ackman is looking at tech. At least that's what I took "mature unicorn" to mean...I think you're right if it's on the debt side, but if they find others to co-invest with, obviously their equity gets diluted

I just found this thread from a few days ago that goes in-depth about SPACs. Great read in the comments! https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/hthocd/thoughts_on_spacs_some_of_the_big_funds_im/Any particular reason you like IAC beyond what the article talks about? I can't tell what to make of the article, comments here and on the article itself indicate the author gets a lot wrong so not sure what to think of itIn-n-out is probably the most recession proof of all lol.  I assumed tech also.They are the best at acquiring internet companies and developing them to their fullest potential.  They just keep harvesting know-how from running their entire portfolio and have a perpetual edge (grow their properties as quickly as possible and acquire any worthy competitors before they pose a threat).  Being the biggest means they get the best media deals by way of purchasing power and will be able to buy the most relevant traffic at the lowest CAC.  Having groomed so many properties with explosive growth means they have a fixed handle on exactly what metrics are most pertinent and have a proven regimen to guarantee just the right amount of governance to promote success without stifling the operators.  Barry Diller is one of the greats and I would bet on him without reservation.https://twitter.com/Dan_Roller/status/1279493455777984512?s=20

This twitter thread says it better than I can. Which also demonstrates my lack of independent thinking as well

In my own words I see them somewhat similar to a Berkshire type entity except that: similar to what Ackman said his issue was- IAC is much more nimble. But also  differently in the sense that their hand is in fast growth internet space, which I personally like much better. 

And yes what everyone else says about their anti-conglomerate playbook.Can you think of any tech companies that would be interesting for him to purchase?Well saidAirbnb has been thrown around. Think mature unicorns.Here's a quick primer: SPACs are blank check companies created solely for the purpose of making an acquisition/investment within a 2-year time horizon (like a search fund on steroids). Traditional SPACs generally IPO with a pool of capital that's held in a trust (cannot be accessed except for a transaction), and IPO investors receive a "SPAC unit" consisting of 1 share of common stock and a fraction of a warrant (generally 1/3). After a number of days post-IPO, the IPO unit splits and the common stock and the warrant will trade separately.

As a common shareholder, you are 1) entitled to the right to redeem your common stock for pro-rata portion of the trust account (essentially meaning you have no risk of principal loss), 2) the right to participate in upside from the transaction due to your warrants.

Here's an example: you buy into a SPAC at IPO, 300 units at $10 apiece (so you invested $3,000). Each unit = 1 share + 1/3 warrant, so you own 300 shares + warrants for 100 shares. Warrants generally have a strike price of $11.50 (15% above issuance price). You hold the shares and the warrants post-IPO and post-split.

The SPAC announces a pending acquisition 12 months later. You are now faced with a choice: redeem your common stock, or participate in the transaction.

Say you don't like the acquisition target at all - you think it's a crappy business and you want no part of it. You redeem your common shares, so you get your initial $3,000 back (likely will be slightly more in reality due to some appreciation over time). You still hold onto your 100 warrants.

The transaction goes through. A few months later, the stock trades up to $15/share - the market has determined that your judgment about the company was wrong. You choose to exercise your 100 warrants, so you receive $3.50/warrant in profit ($15/share - $11.50 strike price) and earn $350 in total profit.

The takeaway: SPACs are unique in that they provide essentially no downside as an alternative to cash but could potentially result in significant upside for shareholders if they make a good acquisition. There have been a lot of run-ups in SPAC-backed companies recently (Nikola, DraftKings, Virgin Galactic, etc.) so there has been some greater interest in the space.

Also as a note of caution when looking at SPAC investing - a lot of SPACs are now trading with negative yield-to-maturity, which means that their common shares are trading above the redeemable value of their trust accounts. This means that the cash-level protection is no longer valid and you are taking real principal risk with your investment. Also, SPACs may not be a true cash replacement due to limited liquidity post-IPO.

\--

As an addendum, I figured I'd explain the SPAC structure from the eyes of the sponsor as well.

In a typical US SPAC, the sponsor receives 20% ownership of the SPAC post-IPO ("sponsor promote") in exchange for some upfront investment (typically \~$20mn to $30mn for larger SPACs) to fund the upfront transaction fees and working capital (employees, travel, etc. to actually find the acquisition target). This 20% sponsor promote is generally viewed as an expense to both investors and to target companies, as it is dilutive to the value of the cash in the trust account. The most comparable cost to this promote in the IPO process is the IPO discount, which is generally offered as a way to reward pre-IPO investors for taking on the risk of investing in a new issuance. In reality, while 20% is generally agreed upon upfront, the promote will most likely be negotiated downward in order to consummate a transaction.

In order to counteract this dilution, SPAC sponsors will generally seek larger targets relative to the size of the issuance - for example, if they raised $500mn in a SPAC, they may try to underwrite a $2 billion transaction with a $1 billion equity check, raising an incremental $500mn PIPE to essentially cut the effective dilution from their promote in half.

SPACs can be incredibly lucrative to sponsors. They invest $20-30mn upfront for equity worth up to 20% of the size of their vehicle, plus stock value upside post-transaction as well as upside from warrants. However, if they are unable to consummate a transaction within the 2-year window, they will lose their upfront investment.

It's also worth noting that Bill Ackman's $4bn SPAC is structured very differently - Pershing Square has optimized the structure for certainty-to-close, creating incentives around the warrants (1/9 issued upfront at IPO, incremental 2/9 if you choose not to redeem at acquisition) and backstopping the equity check with a whopping $3bn forward purchase agreement (there's a bit more to this, but essentially Pershing Square will backstop any redemptions from SPAC investors at transaction in order to guarantee a transaction close). Pershing Square also does not receive a 20% promote on the vehicle, instead choosing for \~6% warrant coverage at a strike price 20% above the issuance price (higher than the 15% premium offered to public shareholders), which means they will lose money ($65mn upfront invested) if the stock does not appreciate significantly post-transaction. Lots of investor alignment here, will be interesting to see how this plays out.You’re investing in potential of the capital raiser to find good ideas to invest in. While assessing the risk of fraud. 

Chamath’s SPACs seem interesting considering his professional and investing track record.I personally could give a shit whether they find the next Nikola or not, I buy SPACs as cash alternative NAV discount trades and robinhood has really fucked this up for me lately.I had a standard equity portfolio until the market rebound a few weeks ago, and I became concerned about another crash. So I shifted a decent amount of my portfolio to SPAC’s to remove most of my beta exposure given their asymmetric return profile. I would say they’re definitely nuanced and the return profile isn’t as straight forward as you think. Given the low trading volumes, they do irrational things such as trading well below their NAV for extended periods of time, huge deltas between warrant intrinsic value and trading value (which can drive you insane), and extreme price volatility on no news. So I’ve shifted my strategy quite a bit based on my early mistakes: 1) warrants carry higher risk than on paper, 2) don’t hold SPAC’s too long after announcement unless you really understand the company and valuation, 3) holding pre-announcement is much safer than post announcement and, 4) you’ve got to be smart about your trading strategy because low volume means brutal spreads every time you make a move. I’m in IPOC, IPOB, CCH, TRNE, APXT, SHLL.Thank you for the post and the great explanations in the comments.I am wondering if there is some good reading material on SPAC’s. Where can I get more information on new SPAC’s and investing in SPAC’s? These remind me of Special Investment Company Listings on Canadian stock market 20 years ago, whose sole purpose was for a company to go public through reverse merger with one of these entities.This is a good overview. Would point out that post close, SPAC's can be quite messy.

As you alluded to, the actual SPAC trust cash is typically insufficient the fund the contemplated transaction. Therefore, you need incremental financing - a combination of a PIPE as well as debt. This can be difficult - without adequate equity proceeds, you end up overlevering the company which can kill your stock price.

Next is shareholder base. In many SPAC transactions, the target is a PE/VC backed company where current owners are looking for an exit. The size of the SPAC trust + PIPE relative to the EV effectively determines how much of the company's equity can be floated. If you can't get it to a high enough number, then you end up with a company with shitty float/ high volatility/ no volume and the commensurate weight on stock price.

An extension of this is that the shareholder base and capitalization (you alluded to this with the warrants, etc) tends to be quite messy. The initial investors in a SPAC tend to be arb/ event traders, etc. not your classic long institutional guys. Therefore, you need to find a way to basically rebuild your shareholder base. PIPE investors will have a lockup - and some may really be in it for the long run - but there's a lot of work to do here, or you risk there being a lot of sellers without buyers, and again, a drag on the stock price. Related to this - a SPAC will not have great coverage based on the underwriters who typically take it to market, which can further limit institutional buyer interest.

There are some SPAC's which are home runs for everyone, but there's a lot where performance is very mediocre, as well, if they aren't managed correctly. Basically, getting the capitalization right is paramount, in addition to the business performance and fundamentals.

Also kind of a fun fact, SPAC's generate an absurd amount of fees for the lawyers, accountants and underwriters.thanks for this insightful post!

having difficulty understanding this part, can you explain equity check and PIPE?Thanks so much for this post. Someone linked this in another thread and I'm super glad I came across it.Aka hot hand fallacyhttps://www.egsllp.com/

this is a boutique law firm that is behind probably a majority of SPAC's, a lot of good info here.If you're willing to pay for a subscription, I've found SPAC Research ([spacresearch.com](https://spacresearch.com)) to be an exceptional source of info on new issuances, current market conditions, etc.Sure - let's walk through an example transaction. 

Say you're a SPAC sponsor with a $500mn vehicle and you come across a company worth $2 billion that you want to buy.

You approach the company and make an offer - you want to buy out the company for $2 billion, funded with $1 billion total equity (the "equity check", which will be partly funded by your SPAC) and $1 billion debt. However, you only have $500 million in your SPAC! So you go to another investment firm (most likely a private equity firm) and you ask them to co-invest alongside you with an additional $500 million (the PIPE, or Private Investment in Public Equity) to fill out the equity check.

Post-acquisition, the capital structure of the company will consist of $1 billion debt, $500 million equity from the private equity firm (the PIPE), and $500 million owned by the SPAC.

The SPAC's $500 million will consist of ownership from the public shareholders of the vehicle plus ownership from the sponsor promote. If we assume for simplicity's sake that the sponsor got to keep its 20% promote, then $100 million worth of stock will be owned by the sponsor, and the remaining $400 million will be owned by the public shareholders of the SPAC.Thanks everyone for giving more info. I also found /r/spacs subreddit. Time to do some reading.Thanks for the suggestion. What SEC filings do SPAC make? Any specific form filing for SPAC?Thanks a bunch!  Looks like this is going to be the breakout year for SPACs, and tons of investors like me who don't know much about them yet are gobbling up good info anywhere where we can.  Pershing in particular is very enticing!  Feels like the entire market has eyes on them right now.  The question for me now is not if but how much to invest, and education to make sure I'm aware of all the risks.  Cheers!Great primer. What is you position/opinion on SPACs? Do you hold any at the moment?Nothing special, just your standard S-1 prospectus pre-IPO and 10-Q/10-K filings post-IPO until transaction.How do you invest in Pershing’s SPAC, if you wanted to?I don't have any position in SPACs. As an individual investor, I can't participate as an IPO investor \[where I think there is particularly compelling risk/reward\] and there aren't any SPACs trading at a significant discount to their trust account values (for riskless gain). 

I'm very risk-averse and tend to rely heavily on research to gain conviction, so I don't want to take any principal risk when it comes to investing in a vehicle where upside is purely speculative (hard to tell what will happen before a target is identified), no matter how protected the downside is.

In short - unless I have access to SPACs during the IPO process (which would need to be institutional), I'd significantly prefer to invest my own money into companies. 

Now if I were running a risk arb hedge fund, this would be an opportunity I'd find highly compelling.Pershing Square's SPAC hasn't yet IPO'd. They're going through the pre-IPO process (looks like there's a good amount of demand as they've upsized from $3bn to $4bn) so if you are an accredited investor and have a wealth manager (like Merrill Lynch or UBS), you can ask for allocation to the actual IPO. I've never been through this process so I'm not sure how it works, but I'm sure your broker would be happy to help you.

If you are a general retail investor and would like to buy on the public markets for your personal account, you'll need to wait until the SPAC actually prices and trades at some point over the next few weeks.Thank you again for a well reasoned response. Can't imagine a lot of targets going the spac way against acceptable valuations now. 

Are there areas/tickers in general that are particularly of interest to you now? I've limited myself to BMY, CI and HIFS as of late given excess most elsewhere (very risk averse as well).Thanks! Much appreciated!
Will it make a difference to own the shares after ipo? Usually it wouldn’t, but in this case I’d assume I wouldn’t get the warrants that a unit buyer gets. Am I right? Thanks againThe IPO unit (share + warrant) stays together for a certain amount of time post-IPO, so if you buy within the first few weeks you should receive both (I think it's 52 days).

To note though - given the unit will be trading together for a while, you may need to pay more than $20 after IPO (as the market price should reflect common stock + implied value of warrant), so you may be taking on some principal risk of loss.

In addition, Pershing Square's SPAC is nuanced in that it has the unique "tontine" mechanism where 1/9 warrant is issued upfront at IPO and 2/9 is held back and issued only to SPAC shareholders who choose not to redeem at combination. If you don't end up buying within the 52-day post-IPO window, you can still buy common shares in the public markets and get a 2/9 warrant if you don't redeem when the SPAC makes an actual acquisition. This is unique for Pershing Square and will likely result in the SPAC common shares trading at a premium to the underlying trust account value until the combination is effected.It's certainly not something I take lightly.

The Central Government in China is making clear with its' decisions, most recently the decision to hold the upcoming IPO of Jack Ma's Ant Group on Chinese exchanges exclusively, that it wishes to reduce and minimize China's reliance upon the USA's economy. At the same time, the Government in the United States is taking a confrontational stance towards China both legislatively and economically as it negotiates the political and economic reality of China's burgeoning superpower status.

These two facts suggest that the period of relatively close economic ties enjoyed by China and the US may be coming to a close. In my view, this may have an effect on neighbouring countries in East and South Asia, who may benefit from an uptick in demand for manufacturing and other services from the USA. Whether this demand can be capitalized upon depends on if the construction and creation of infrastructure and regulatory structures can be implemented effectively in those countries. China, in its' current position as a transitioning economy, may outsource a part of its' domestic production to Africa, an area of the world where it has significant financial interest, and may attempt to transition to a service-based economy serving it's growing middle and upper classes by reducing its' reliance on the manufacturing sector.

Regarding issues such as social unrest, political instability and COVID-19, it's my unfortunate view that China is in many ways more adequately equipped to counter these threats than the USA. China has a very extensive and pervasive system of state control and surveillance, both economically and socially, which enables it to be very decisive with its' policy creation. The Chinese people are also generally patriotic and fairly nationalistic, preferring a 'strong' China with a resolute leader to a free and democratic China. The Chinese Government has an easier time enacting policy, and has an easier time convincing its' people to obey and support that policy - this is useful, for example, for enforcing the wearing of masks and social distancing. It also has more effective means of surveillance and a less accountable police force and legal system, which makes the suppression of political dissidents less cumbersome than in the USA, where principles of fairness and justice come before the well-being of the State.

There's also the issue of military aggression from the Chinese side, against India on the border and against their disputed territories in the South China Sea. Tensions flaring in these regions, as well as the presence of Chinese neo-colonialism in Africa, indicates China's desire to spread both its' physical borders and its' political and financial influence independently of the USA. This may have the effect of dividing political and financial allegiances globally between the USA and China, as countries weigh up their options and decide which global superpower offers them the most in exchange for the least.I think it's awesome actually. China has become the world's manufacturer and that needs to change.This will likely lead to more nationalistic actions and policies to bring supply chains back to the  home continent. IMO, along with the increased monetary and fiscal stimulus funded by the FED potentially leading to widespread increased spending and potential economic recovery in the next year or so, the anti-globalization policies have the risk of spurring inflation in the mid-term future (2-3 years out). I am allocating a portion of my portfolio to precious metals and some miners to protect it against this possibility.Invest in MexicoRead Ray Dalio's "Changing World Order" articles on LinkedIn. Great insight into this exact question.

He seems to be advocating for diversification into stocks ex-USA, as well as for gold purchases and alternative asset hedges.

TL;DR from a portfolio management perspective: buy gold and diversify away from US. Buy a little into China and stay far away from bonds and cash.

My 2c: look at emerging market economies with close ties to China if you are hesitant to buy direct Chinese.Rising tension with China => higher inflation in the future. China is really the one major force that has suppressed global inflation since the 1970s. We should expect a return to 1970s era high inflation if China leaves the USD sphere.

Also, rising distrust between countries means that the USD as a trusted medium of exchange between nations is on its way out. Most likely global trade will revert to at least a partial gold standard.

Bottom line is, buy gold.Manufacturing shift to India and SE asia already starting. Cold War with China has already been going on 20 years. It’s just now US is fighting backI’m avoiding talking about whether I think the actions of the US are right or wrong and just focusing on the likely outcomes.

Overall it will lead to some form of de-globalisation which will result in higher inflation, which is both good and bad. Companies that can pass on costs to consumers, normally that would be utilities (regulation dependent), consumer durables, commodities, and residential, will benefit. Other companies may suffer due to decreasing margins where they aren’t able to pass on costs. Higher costs also means lower demand, in the aggregate, for an economy unless employment can be kept high with commensurate wage growth. 

Long term, higher inflation will also lead to higher interest rates, which will punish companies that are over levered, but that’s maybe 2+ years down the road. 

If governments are able to boost demand via fiscal stimulus then it could still be good for stocks overall, but if they don’t I.e. because Politicians can’t agree on a plan, then you may see stagflation as we had in the 70’s.Trump will slowly increase nationalistic anti-China sentiments.

Right before the election some big move will be done to seemingly piss off China (coordinated with them, of course). Everyone will be happy, markets will tank a little, which will be perceived as a necessary pain, but ultimately Trump will be re-elected, and over time will roll back/scale down that "big punishment for China".

TL;DR: prepare for a move down before the election.I would be very wary about investing in companies who are dependent on Chinese consumers for top-line growth (sbux, for instance). If relations really take a turn, China just doesn't have much to lose by excommunicating American firms who skim profits off their growing middle class without actually investing in the supply chain that made the middle class possible in the first place.While I advocate a more forceful approach with China, I also hope we enter the conflict with our eyes open.

US-USSR Cold War never became hot because both countries were run by mature adults who experienced the horrors of WW2. This is not the case with today's US (Trump...) and China, with its "wolf diplomacy" idiocy.

Everyone talks about a new Cold War with China. But without the Greatest Generation to guide us, I fear not a repeat of the Cold War, but a repeat of the conditions that led to WW1.It’s about time. Their human rights abuse and slave labor needs to end. America and the rest of the world needs to treat them the same way we did the Soviet Union. They’re directly responsible for hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths from a disease they hid from the rest of the world before it was too late. Shame on CCP.

I feel like the only way that comes to fruition is if we get negative rates or high inflation leading to capital outflows and a stagflation type setup in the US causing others to lose confidence in the stability of the currency.

I like you’re idea; I’m hesitant with Chinese companies directly just with the lack of regulation there seen most recently with the Luckin Fraud.I’m sure other countries like India, Taiwan, and several others would be happy to take China’s place.

If manufacturing moves to other low cost of production locations, then the effect is the same as when manufacturing was in china, no?To be fair, while China downplayed Covid-19, silenced whistleblowers, and engaged in a cover-up, the United States failed to take the threat seriously. Intelligence reports on the looking threat were documented in the presidential policy book. Though they hid the extent and scope of the disease, the Chinese did not hide the lethality of the disease prior to outbreaks devastating global business. This was exposed in Peter Navarro's memo. 

I agree on the get tough on China stance since I view China as an ideological threat which a male-centric population, and a nation that abuses it's position. Yet, Covid-19 was likely an accident and the world was caught off guard by this evolving threat. Moreover, the United States has been singularly ill-prepared, which, though it pre-dates the current administration, has been hampered by anti-science denialism & American arrogance.  Americans have a perverted idea of freedom, while China admittedly has no idea what freedom is.

If you are writing that from AC room on your laptop in USA you are a raging hypocriteThis is counterfactual. The USA has a strong legal foundation and an independent judiciary. China, on the other hand, has a rubber-stamp court system with a 99% conviction rate. One of these countries clearly places more value upon the principles of fairness and justice than the other.

Although I don't disagree with you when it comes to the abhorrent treatment of Indigenous people in the British Colony countries historically, it should be noted that every empire in the world has been expansionist - from the Mongol Empire to the Ottoman Empire and countless others. The entire world as we know it is formed from the repeated rapid growth and recession of expansionist empires - it's not just the USA that was formed this way. To levy this criticism at the USA and not at, say, the Arab world that was built off the back of 10 centuries of African enslavement, displays a clear double standard in your thinking.

Capitalistic inequality, as you put it, is the driving force behind human development. The idea that one should receive a superior reward for a superior contribution is called meritocracy, and it's not an idea I find too much fault with if I'm to be honest. If we were all exactly the same, with the same assets and the same net worth, why would anybody try to excel, to innovate, to stand out? It's one of the problems they faced in the Soviet Union - how do you inspire people to excel and innovate, if those innovations are not rewarded? There's also the risk and reward argument, which states that we should demand greater compensation for taking more risk. Since any entrepreneurial venture is risky by its' nature, those undertaking entrepreneurial ventures must be motivated by the prospect of greater reward. Why would any rational person take the risk of innovating - that is, taking the risk of losing everything to advance humanity - if they were offered no reward for this undertaking? They may as well simply stay in their secure and stable job and not take the risk. Financial equality, in this sense, would stifle innovation and growth.Reread the sentence. He did not imply china was democratic.> The Chinese people are also generally patriotic and fairly nationalistic, preferring a 'strong' China with a resolute leader to a free and democratic China.

You're free to take your moralizing to /r/politics or maybe /r/humanrightsIn the scenario of a Cold War II, I expect China to win. The US has little chance of winning a long term confrontation with China at this point, so it's a dumb idea to start one.

The American political class at this point are like the Soviet leadership in the 1970s. They are unimaginative and bound by ideological rigidities. The domestic political trend of the US is toward becoming a Latin American style country. This country will not be structurally capable of competing with China.I think you're going to see more supply chain diversification in other low-cost labor countries rather than a manufacturing return to the USYou have to consider, why is so much manufacturing being done in China right now. Why not India? Why not African countries? Many of these other countries have much lower prevailing wages than China.

There are many costs, because there are many inputs to manufacturing. Labor is simply one input, and it is an increasingly minor input in manufacturing. Depending on the particular product, the cost of capital, energy, logistics, and supply chains can be much more decisive than labor costs. 

China is low cost because of a combination of many factors. Chinese labor is no longer cheap, but it is comparable in quality to that of developed countries while being cheaper than developed countries. Eastern China has better infrastructure than most developed countries, this gives Chinese manufacturers some of the lowest logistic costs in the world. China has a domestic abundance of capital and savings, this gives China a massive cost of capital advantage over every other developing country. An example of this is the Shanghai Gigafactory. The government of Shanghai was able to finance most of the factory and offer Tesla a turnkey factory without any up front capital investment from Tesla. Most developing countries that have to pay a cost of capital >6-10% can't afford to do this.

The really major one is supply chain costs. If you manufacture in India, but all your component inputs still have to be imported from China, you will incur higher supply chain risk and cost which will eat into your labor cost savings. Attempting to replicate the supply chain locally will require massive up front capital investment, and India has a much higher cost of capital than China.

In practice what this means is that China can manufacture things for cheaper than countries with far lower wages. Chinese products can undersell African producers with wages that are 1/5 of prevailing Chinese wages due to the greater internal supply efficiency in China. A worker in Senegal that makes $100/month isn't as cost efficient as a worker in China that makes $700/month.

China's high savings rate and cheap capital means that China can upgrade its capital stock far more cheaply than poorer countries. The rise of automation actually makes Chinese manufacturers more competitive relative to poorer developing countries. At the same time, the size of the internal supply chain makes China more competitive than smaller countries with less population. The cost of labor makes China more competitive than developed countries with higher wages.

It is a combination of these factors that makes Chinese factories sit at the sweet spot of factors that give them the lowest production costs across a very wide range of manufactured products. Moving manufacturing out of China will mean giving up many of these advantages. Diversifying supply chains across countries increases risk and cost. For example, during the COVID-19 crisis, cross border movement of people was shut down. Many factories in Vietnam rely on access to Chinese managers and technicians to function. With borders shut down, these people can't go to Vietnam, so the Vietnamese factories had to shutdown and the orders had to be given to factories in China. Every time you cross a national border, you are subject to an extra layer of border controls, customs, tariffs, and political risk. These all add to the cost of the final product.

What is really special about China is that it has a work force that is larger than the previously industrialized world put together, so it is able to absorb a massive number of different types of manufacturing because it has enough workers. When you put all these different types of manufacturing in the same country, it drastically cuts the frictional costs of combining the outputs of these intermediate producers. The only other country with comparable work force size is India, but India internally does not all speak the same language. India has 22 official languages internally, and the largest one, Hindi, is spoken only by 43% of the population. So in practice, even India can't match the economy of scale of China, since no single language community within India has the scale to compete with the Mandarin speaking population of China.

The more technically sophisticated manufacturing becomes, the more important the size of your language community. You need to be able to communicate increasingly sophisticated technical concepts effectively with a wide network of suppliers, and doing so across a language barrier sharply reduces communication efficiency.China used to subsidize production industry. This allows for cheaper prices than any unregulated economy could have, they would need to turn a profit. Also issues of scale and logistic infrastructure.Because their currency doesn't float they are eating the world's inflation to keep their currency pegBefore you go on your anti America rant don’t forget 500 Thousands have died outside of America because China hid the virus and didnt let WHO tell everyone what was going on.

>he entire world as we know it is formed from the repeated rapid growth and recession of expansionist empires

Glad you agree on some points. However people do come from places. E.g. English people come from English. They are the original people of English (mixed with some nords and germans). No case can be made they "colonised" England. So no not everywhere is a result of "expansionist" empires. And in cases of Mexico and South American countries, because the locals have mixed with colonizers you can't call the average mexican a spanish invader of their own land because they're mixed. And most important locals in these countries who are 100% indigenous are treated perfectly well and have no discrimination placed upon them.

Nobody said capitalism doesn't ultimately work in some form. It just doesn't create a fair environment when it's not done right. The US with all the shitty L-O-B-B-Y-I-N-G that allows rich folks to buys laws and buys politicians, fake news media monopolies reporting absolute nonsense (and not the news) is not capitalism done right. It's capitalism shoved down people's throats with some date-rape drug.Thanks for the clarification ... perhaps i misunderstood!Peter Zeihan is a hack.

So China (currently) lacks a blue navy - is the US going to start blocking oil shipments to China? No.I mean you can say the same thing about America... why shouldnt that change too

America has more good jobs than anywhere else in the worldI hate authoritarian commies too, but let's not begrudge the hundreds of millions who were lifted out of dirt poor poverty. I've seen parts of the world that are like that, and no one should have to live like that. 

Our hope was that with greater business ties and economic liberalization would come political liberalization, clearly that didn't pan out. 

Fuck the CCP with a rusty metal crowbar.We did it to break them from the Soviets.,....and unless you’re talking a selective embargo, full embargo is where nukes are legitimately on the table given China’s food and energy position. If you’re saying that you’re betting on lack of a delivery vector they could land against the US, I’d disagree but could follow your reasoning. If not, it seems just as out there as when the PLA talks about ramming carriers with cruisers.

Personally, I don’t see why it matters that they are authoritarian. It’s not like we’ve followed that line before and we probably would have saved lives if we’d been willing to accept a more authoritarian leader in Iraq or Afghanistan instead of the Iranian puppets or tame dogs we got instead. Plenty of our democratic allies like Taiwan and Korea got their start as democracies in name only while actually being military dictatorships. The real issue is that the US is having to deal with the fact that it should have done steps to block China’s more aggressive actions 10-20 years ago instead of our strange obsession with bombing people in mud huts.[removed]Lapses in regulation happen, US hasn’t been immune either. BaFin I don’t believe is as bad as the Chinese regulators imo; just look at how much success firms like Muddy waters have had finding opportunities to short in China and I feel like you hear about fewer in Europe generally. 

I feel safer with regulation in Europe than I do in China (although if you can prove me wrong here statistics on this would be interesting to see and I’d invite you to do so). On a individual company level I feel better about not being victim to frauds just by performing adequate research and while your exposure is less if you’re in a larger ETF, I’m still skeptical of a lot of Chinese companies.I wonder why you’re so butthurt. Anyway, perhaps you should work on your reading comprehension. The first half of my comment was nothing political, it clearly stated that certain countries could fill the vacuum left by China. The second part is part and parcel of what’s required from good corporate responsibility standards before investing. A good political system is also required for safe and sustainable long term investments and having a good supply of labour (perhaps the Uighurs would make great employees).India is a disaster of public official corruption and caste privilege. That’s why India is a third world nation despite its intellectual and cultural depth. India can’t plausibly compete with China without major reforms. The US will have to start scrounging for suppliers of its consumer goodsChina will face massive headwinds due to their changing demographics. By 2100 their population is expected to be halved.This is assuming their pegged rate is far from what would be the floating rate, correct? Also it's not truly pegged, the yuan still flucatesYes, at least half a million known Covid-19 fatalities outside the US, which of course includes China itself. China has also destroyed evidence of original virus samples. They tried to put a lid on the virus, and downplayed it's severity, while failing to stop the spread. Sound familiar? These pandemic is the peeling back of establishment resilience in all walks of life. It has its own logic. The WHO parroted Chinese Communist statements in the early days. 

That said, I won't pretend that the USA handled this virus well. That is a lie. And the numbers - US leading in cases and fatalities - shows that to be the case. You have to ask why, however uncomfortable the truth may be. We literally had the intelligence we needed to prevent mass death. That requires political capital. Not this is the new Democrat "hoax" right-wing bullshit.[deleted]That's called an unfair deal, that does not mean forcing.  They still have a choice not to do business with China.  We would not be in this mess if those companies invested domestically or with a country that is not China.That’s true big reason why China selling USD has no impact is due to strong foreign capital inflows keeping our rates down. If that ever changes we’re in troubleYou didn't answer his question. Don't pollute this space with r/politics level garbage.We just don't make much anymore. Everything is farmed out to lower cost countries. As it should be really. Competitive advantage and such. I just think the concentration in China needs to be diversified from a political and economic perspective.It is not our responsibility to uplift them. That is their task.  
  
You need to take care of yourself first so that you are able to take care of your family so that your family has the capacity to produce more than they consume so that things get better not worse so that you can help your community so that your community can help others on and on until your nation is helping other nations.  
  
In the event of the loss of cabin-pressure, put your mask on first.How am i butthurt lol

I'm just saying there are forums for you to go moralize but this is not one of them.This isn't India's only problems either. India at this point is turning into a Hindu Fascist state. It will have unending problems with its own Muslim population.

India will not have the requisite domestic political stability to really focus on economic growth. Choosing Hindu Nationalism is a big mistake for the Indian government.It's impossible to predict what demographics will look like in 80 years. The best we can do is predict 1 generation ahead.

The main cause of low fertility in China in the present generation is compressed urbanization. A lot of people shifted from rural to urban living without sufficient time to accumulate capital first. Urban cost of living is far higher than rural cost of living, so this suppresses fertility among first generation "immigrants".

This will likely change in subsequent generations. Those who are too poor to get married won't have kids. Those who have kids generally only have one. Their kids will inherit a ton of assets from the accumulation of the previous generation. When 2 people who are only children get married, they inherit the combined assets of both families. This wealth will enable them to start families much earlier and have more children than their parents generation.

I expect Chinese population demographic trends to reverse in about 20 years due to this wealth effect. The rate of wealth accumulation right now in Chinese families is extremely rapid due to the 4-2-1 family structure.

In both China and US, realized fertility is lower than desired fertility. The main constraint is financial. Many women cannot afford to have as many children as they want due to financial constraints. Yet middle class Chinese are accumulating wealth much faster due to the higher rate of economic growth and also the lower current fertility. This means that the financial constraints on realized fertility will improve much faster in China than in the US. If you look at median wealth per adult (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_wealth_per_adult), the gap between US and China is much smaller than the gap in income, and it will close much sooner than the gap in per capita income.Yes the precise term is dirty float.  I think it's save to assume it's very unlikely that the yuan is correctly trading where it would be under a free float. Just look at the massive foreign currency holdings the Chinese central banks has and has held over time...A lot of other countries took the early warnings from China and dealt with the threat much better than the US. It is simply a lie that they didn’t let WHO know what was happening. The US and some European countries simply spent more time discrediting WHO, and spinning it against China than actually preparing for the virus. 

I’m not from China but where I’m from we a) have had news reports about the virus dating back to February and b) started taking action in April (though my workplace closed the offices in March). It is mind boggling when people say that you can’t trust the numbers from China, which implies that it could be worse, but then proceed to not take any steps towards preparing when China was telling the rest of the world to do so.

China invited WHO early on to deal with the virus, due to their failure in dealing with SARS, but that was being called out as WHO being bought out by China. So if you don’t trust China, and you can’t trust WHO, what would you have expected to happen in your country?

You talk about the ideological threat that China poses and while rightly so many other countries aren’t striving to be a one party dictatorship, no one thinks that US is truly democratic either. If anything US vs China will go down in history as a cautionary tale for drinking too much of your own Kool aid.The only NPC is you kiddo. I said we need to treat them like soviet union and gave actual reasons backing up why we need to do that. All of that is relevant to the discussion of tensions with ccp and how we should move forward with them. Now let me take a wild guess you have major case of TDS too, right?High debt, political instability and deep recession will get us there soon.This is counterfactual.  
There is more manufacturing in the US than ever right now (and this was true in the 10's, 00', 90, & 80's.)  
However much more manufacturing went overseas than was added domesticately decade after decade for the last sixty years.  
2B people were uplifted out of poverty but China become a world power and we gave away a ton of wealth and power to them.  
They use that wealth and power to influence our politicians and policies - even our celebrities.  
Remember when the NBA dared to say Free Hong Kong?The proper insult is to wish they purchase tesla stock.But lower fertility is a global phenomenon.

Why should china suddenly have above 2,1 kids per family?

The us is able to attract skilled immigrants from all over the world. China? Less so.Good point. Need to look no further than some currencies that trade on the black market> we a) have had news reports about the virus dating back to February and b) started taking action in April (though my workplace closed the offices in March).

There were worldwide reports even earlier than that, maybe mid/early January. I remember specifically because I was living in Asia at the timeIt is definitively clear that China was not as transparent as they could have been in the earliest days. I know senior people at WHO (I am writing this comment from Geneva, actually) and while they give high marks to China's cooperation with them after early January, they will admit - only in private, because of the politics - that China made some serious mistakes early (in late December and the first few days of January) that did serious damage to the pandemic response.

The most clear example of China's misdeeds was its shutting down all domestic travel out of Hubei, but allowing international flights to operate without restriction and spread the virus around the world. This decision was straight up psychopathic.Truth is I'm much more terrified of a Dominant China rolling tanks into India or land troop ships in Taiwan than I am of the US getting involved in any dispute.  Trump has called to pull troops out of Afghanistan and as far as I'm concerned that is a good sign.


China has demonstrated its willingness to do what's best for China at the expense of literally any group, country, religion, or any other idea.  A destabliszed US means there is no counter balance to aggressive Chinese expansion.  It is a precarious world we find ourselves though, not the worst it's ever seen.Lower fertility isn't a global phenomenon. Scandinavian fertility rates bounced back after hitting bottom in the 80s. Fertility rates are related to median wealth levels in developed countries. The faster your middle class accumulates wealth, the faster your fertility rates will bounce back.

I doubt the US will be able to attract skilled immigrants in net from around the world for much longer. I myself have emigrated from the US because the US is becoming unlivable. Cost of living in the US is becoming insane, especially for families.

Among my close relatives, half of my generation (mid-30s) have already left the US and permanently settled abroad. More and more young Americans will start leaving in search of better deals abroad.

One thing I think is important to note is the difference between fertility within marriage and fertility outside of marriage. In the US context, fertility outside of marriage should basically be discounted because without a Scandinavian style welfare state, single motherhood almost guarantees poverty and poor social outcomes for the children. These people are just as likely to contribute to the future prison population as well as to the future work force.Yes I think so, but I was hesitant to state that because I don’t think anyone even paid attention to that. It only really became news I would say in early February, when it was only in China and Japan I believe.I don’t think it’s fair to think that they ought to shut down the entire country on day one if this is a novel virus. In hindsight sure, but even if China were more open by a few weeks or even months, the US response was to deny that the virus was even real so would it really have changed a thing?

Of course one can argue that if they China dealt with the virus earlier then it would have been contained, but I don’t think that the international community at large should rely on this as a strategy for dealing with pandemics. 

I think my point here, if the virus didn’t start in China, trade war and all, it would’ve been less politicised. If it started in Country X, not a political enemy of the US, and we keep all things the same they took 1-2 months to really get the word out, the US would at the very least not attack WHO.

The US did more harm both to themselves and the world by discrediting the WHO, which continues to today, and to de-platform Dr Fauci, despite the whole situation getting worse. And they did all this not interest of US citizens but to spite a political enemy.

Also to think that we are comparing China’s lack of transparency vs the US administrations outright lies that the virus is a hoax. I do believe that the local Chinese governments had incentive to withhold information but once the central government got wind of it, their action has been rather effective. Years from now, we’d still be debating if the virus is a hoax...that is hindsight bias in action.

As CEO of automotive company for example, you won't recall every single variant of certain car just because there is 1 complaint about a malfunctioning brake. You have to make sure first whether it is reporting error, car owner's mishandlings, batch production error, or total disaster from initial system design. 

This is a country with 1.4 billion population. You can't expect them to shut down the entire country just because 1 or few report of strange new diseases.>	The most clear example of China's misdeeds was its shutting down all domestic travel out of Hubei, but allowing international flights to operate without restriction and spread the virus around the world. This decision was straight up psychopathic.

True, but at the same time, I remember reading articles about this as it happened. There is no reason other countries had to keep accepting flights from Hubei, seeing that China wasn’t even allowing them internally due to pandemic risk.

How many countries actually did this? And even when they did (US), there was a delay of weeks.The Us has a much longer track record of invading foreign countries compared to China tbhFertility rates in Denmark and Sweden are still below replacement levels.

Compare China to the us with regards to attraction highly skilled workers. I know it is fun to shit on the us currently however America still has massive soft power compared to China.

If I had to pick a winner by 2100 I would call the us a slight favorite.This is delusional, fertility and wealth are inversely correlated. I'm not sure how the anecdotes prove anything, the US still drains the brains of other nations much more than the oppressive Han state of China.> I don’t think it’s fair to think that they ought to shut down the entire country on day one if this is a novel virus. In hindsight sure, but even if China were more open by a few weeks or even months, the US response was to deny that the virus was even real so would it really have changed a thing?

Why are you all reading my comment this way? I didn't ever write anything like this at all.

In fact your understanding is basically the exact opposite of my point:

China *did* take very strong internal measures to stop travel out of Hubei. They simultaneously chose to apply *no* measures to travel out of Hubei to international destinations. This differential is indefensible. If Hubei was so bad that they had to lock it down internally, they should have locked it down externally too.It seems you have either failed to read - or failed to understand - my comment.

The point I am making is that China *did* take **very** strong internal quarantine measures very quickly with respect to internal travel. They shut down all travel from Hubei very, very early.

But they did not apply these measures to international travel, because that was someone else's problem. They were happily allowing international flights to leave Hubei while simultaneously locking down internal travel.

That is psychopathic to an incredible degree.In no small part because Trumps' nativist bullshit has turned closing borders into a political issue.And yet life is objectively better with the United States at the helm. We dont outright attack the borders of countries like India or threaten countries like Taiwan on a daily basis.  Chinese dominance would usher in a dystopian age."Fertility rates in Denmark and Sweden are still below replacement levels."

This is because their economies stagnated. Fertility trends are starting to reverse in Denmark and Sweden due to economic setbacks in the aftermaths of 2008. Nevertheless, their fertility trends disprove the idea that rising incomes correlate with lower fertility.

Even within the US, lower fertility is positively correlated with recessions. If rising incomes correlated with lower fertility, you would expect fertility rates to be inversely correlated with the economic cycle.

American soft power at this point exist only in the minds of American exceptionalists. In the rest of the world, the US is a laughing stock at this point.Fertility and wealth are definitely not inversely correlated. Desired fertility is largely independent of wealth, while realized fertility is enabled by wealth.

My anecdotes are simply intended to show that smart people are starting to abandon the US, and that the future will not be like the past. At some point the US will have a net brain drain flowing outward.Again this is easier said in hindsight. Imagine the international backlash “China kidnaped Americans and trap them in (fake) virus laden city”. Remember, this is probably the same time when the US was criticising a) welding down gates like the authoritarian rulers they are and b) building makeshift hospitals in a manner of days because all Chinese are enslaved or something.

The US does a great job of believing how bad it is and how fake the virus is simultaneously, depending on what fits the narrative you want to portray. So of course you can ban international travel, if you are brave enough.Again, it is such a hindsight bias.

Imagine if China, in the middle of trade war suddenly forbid international and any westerner or tourist in general trapped in Hubei, because of "unknown diseases".

People like you can only see "china bad". But hindsight bias is real whether you like it or not.No, you guys only invade countries like Cuba, overthrow legitimately elected governments like in Iran and Chile and outright occupy countries like Iraq and Vietnam... i could go on

I don't see why what the Chinese is doing is worse. Also why is China at fault for the issue with India? You can just as easily argue that the Indians were the aggressors...?There haven’t been a single year since 1980 with a danish birth rate at 2,1 or above.

It might be rising but it is not 2,1.

Lastly America has a lot of soft power. How many Chinese songs have you listened to lately? How many movies have you seen?

Talented engineers are not going to stay away from attractive jobs in America in 2050 because of trump. Furthermore if global talent is deterred due to human rights violations I doubt that they will prefer China.

Nevertheless China is expected to have their population half by 2100. They need to get rich before they get old. It will be interesting to see how they will handle this? Will they allow for hundreds of millions of migrants (and where are they supposed to come from?).

Here is the newest estimate:

https://www.google.dk/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-53424726

The Lancet study predicts that China's population will peak at 1.4 billion in four years' time before nearly halving to 732 million by 2100.

Official data showed the country's birth rate had fallen to its lowest level in 70 years in 2019.

Some fear that the country is a "demographic time bomb", which will see a smaller working-age population having to support a bigger, retired population. As one of the world's biggest economies, this would have global ramifications>At some point the US will have a net brain drain flowing outward.

Wishful thinking and fortune telling.

>  Fertility and wealth are definitely  not inversely correlated. Desired fertility is largely independent of  wealth, while realized fertility is enabled by wealth.

Very simply they are, for whatever reason, we see replacement fertility rates very low for developed nations, high for undeveloped nations. Desired fertility is a rather wishy-washy measurement compared to actuality and the revealed economic preference of greater wealth reducing family size. The only confounder I've found is Israel.Why do you all keep fixating on the optics of the relatively tiny number of foreign expats? That's not what I'm fucking talking about, I'm talking about the many **Chinese citizen nationals** who were permitted to fly out of Wuhan to international destinations while simultaneously being prohibited from traveling within China. China could have permitted foreigners to leave while preventing its own nationals from leaving, and that would have done a great deal to slow the initial spread out of Wuhan.

At the very least, China could have been open that there was extreme risk on flights coming from Wuhan to international destinations, which was clearly its assessment given that it banned those flights internally. If other nations had known how wild the pandemic was in Wuhan, and that China had stopped internal travel, they would have had more information to justify applying strict quarantines to incoming flights from Wuhan. If they did, much spread would have been prevented.

In fairness, in mid January our countries were still mostly up our own asses at that point over how "racist" travel restrictions were, so it's not clear that China's being open would have been effective given that Western countries might have chosen to not apply blanket quarantines. I'm not suggesting that China's one decision made the whole difference. But it is definitely worthy of criticism.But I'm not suggesting they should have locked all the westerners in Hubei. I'm suggesting they could have started with their own citizens at least, which would have been both eminently reasonable and also an effective step to reduce transmission since many foreign hotspots (particularly northern Italy) were linked to travel by Chinese nationals from Hubei.

It is also worth noting that foreign nationals in Hubei were equally barred from internal travel in China, so this isn't some foreign vs. domestic citizenship issue. It was motivated simply by the fact that the infections that left the country were not China's problem.

You appear to be reading a lot of dumb shit into my comment that I did not write. Presumably you are doing this because of the things you have heard other people say, and extrapolating from this one comment of mine that I agree with them.

I will say this once, gently: engage with what I am actually writing, not with your spurious and inaccurate assumptions of my other views. You have no fucking idea what kind of person I am to make comments about "people like me" other than that I am criticizing one aspect of China's response. Many other aspects of China's response have been laudable. It has done one of the better jobs in the world of its response, frankly.

But I shouldn't have to write these disclaimers to prevent idiots from reading a bunch of bullshit into my statements.

This, of all forums, should ideally be free of people making shitty baseless assumptions. Conduct yourself accordingly, please.I'm talking about right now not absolving anyone of the past.  China extended their tyranny over Hong Kong in violation of treaty and now forcibly [sterilizing their Uyghur population.](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/chinas-ambassador-shown-shocking-video-22379489)

To whatabout the genocide of these people is beyond the pale. The US needs to be at the head of stopping this pure revival of Nazi crimes.  If we mean "Never Again" then here is the opportunity right now."Talented engineers are not going to stay away from attractive jobs in America in 2050 because of trump"

It has nothing to do with Trump and everything to do with economics. The US is simply no longer economically attractive for many educated people. The ridiculous cost of education and healthcare simply makes working and living in the US not that attractive. This isn't something that is caused by Trump, and it won't be something that can be fixed by whoever comes after Trump. 

Frankly the standard of living for middle class people suck in the US. Just look at how many people are in deep financial distress because they lost their job for a few months. Look at how many people are stuck in deep student loan debt because of the ridiculous cost of higher education.How then can you explain the inverse correlation between recessions and fertility if greater wealth leads to lower fertility?So don’t fixate on issues that will spark WW3? Okay makes sense. You do you.They do not have an substantial enduring effect, being cyclical, on per-capita GDP. Likewise but more importantly they do no reverse the course of declining fertility in the developed countries suffering these recessions - a recession does not turn NYC into rural South Sudan, the social and economic context does not change radically. Explanatory power goes to the social sciences, perhaps the usual stress-induced sexual activity hearkening back to the human impulse to have more children during bad times, like famines, human emotions and anxiety within individuals don't differentiate the severity in absolute terms across history. Good times, and wealth, give people the luxury of thinking ahead to delay and plan child bearing. The result is fewer children, another proxy of this is female education attainment. Poverty breeds children, even if many more die than they otherwise would with more wealth available to the families having them.No dumbass, don't fixate on a proposal I didn't make. I wasn't talking about fucking foreign expats, I was talking about Chinese citizen nationals. Which I literally just explained in the last fucking comment, so at this point it is pretty clear that your being an imbecile is intentional.I have a different perspective on this. I think wealth should not be a 1-dimensional concept. The traditional concept of wealth is $/capita income or assets, but this only captures a subset of wealth. The optionality of free time, the relative cost of goods and services, and opportunity cost of children all matter.

Most middle class people in "wealthier" countries are mostly wealthier in a very narrow sense. They have greater access to industrialized products and services. Yet many goods and services such as housing, education, childcare are extremely expensive as a percentage of their income. In many developed countries, the cost of daycare for 2 children will equal the median income for women. The cost of housing requires 2 incomes to finance a family home. This is a sign of poverty rather than wealth.

Many middle class in developed countries are extremely time poor, and raising children is a time intensive activity. They are wealthy enough to afford material goods, but they are not wealthy enough to pay the time opportunity costs of raising children.

Fertility rates will bounce back when average people have lots of free time and energy to do whatever they want. It is being able to afford a house without both parents having to work. I think a generous UBI program will help recover fertility rates across the developed world.Ah personal insults now eh? Do you need some help getting your points across? Or just continue insulting people on the internet, please don’t let me stop you.I need no help getting my points across, but when I encounter idiots who do not read them I stop bothering to communicate respectfully and just insult you.The insults don’t really help to make your point even if it sometimes make a difference in the court of public opinion. Either way, insults only serve to discredit your arguments, as does justifying your insults.I think he’s a smart guy, the Herbalife short should have worked, everyone and their mother knows it’s a pyramid scheme.I wonder what a dollar invested at issuance in the last public Pershing square vehicle would be worth todayIt sort of did, they got a pretty large fine from the government. It just didn’t turn out as he would have liked.Why should it have worked? His entire strategy was patently absurd and detached from reality. He must have forgot he was in the United States. What was his grand plan? Compel the US government to regulate hlf out of existence?Pershing Square Holdings? It's actually trading below the IPO price, but I started buying when everyone was shitting all over Ackman for a couple bad investments despite his track record in Pershing Square Capital Management that beats the market.Since inception he’s returned a 16% CAGR or so. I believe the fund started around 2004. He mentioned it during an interview with Bloomberg in the past month or so.I mean, yeah, pyramid schemes are illegal in the US.


https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/business-guidance-concerning-multi-level-marketing

It’s a pyramid scheme pretending to be a MLM.Trading at 66% of NAV seems a bit silly to me...

His returns are pretty impressive the last few years considering he hasn't been in any of the whirlwind tech stocks.Haha, that was my point -- compare a dollar invested in that to the s&p over the same period. Don't get me wrong I also bought some Pershing square on nav discount but the cult of personality around this guys is incredible.Yeah that not dollar weighted. That is: his performance with a ton of aum was very very bad. 

The public vehicle is also way worseA lot of his big losses were also in SPV’s outside the fund.

If you dollar weight his returns, it’s pretty bad. For starters, he lost over $4 billion on VRX.Responding to your quick edit. And? What's your point? That's your investment strategy? Relying on a market fundamentalist cult to take drastic anti-market regulatory actions all in the name of "public interest" or something silly like that? Stop smoking crack. Check your passport and remember where you are. I think you're forgetting something here. Was he right? This is past tense  isn't it? So Ackman scored right? Because hlf is clearly an illegal pyramid scheme. Oh wait. It hit all time highs last year and is well on it's way back. And yet you're still here, years later, fighting reality like it doesn't exist.You working stiff riff raffs are so delusional it's basically cute.Is some of that discount due to management fees or something? I haven't looked at how it's structured.I’m aware the difference, but I couldn’t directly answer your question. Providing some figure seemed slightly better than nothing at all.K. All I said is I agreed with his hypothesis, he could have made a lot as well.Nothing to gain from being an arrogant dipshit dude.Some of the discount certainly is.

But if you assume the NAV regularly outperforms the S&P, there's no real reason for there to be a discount. 

NAV return since inception for PSH is still bad (well below the market) which is likely what's driving it IMO. Assumes that's likely to continue.Damn that guy is mad as hell. All you did was point out a legitimate ruling and he's triggered to high hell lmaoI'm thinking about buying the SPAC and waiting to see what he finds, almost entirely because it sounds like fun.Do you illiterate children ever get tired of being illiterate children? What ruling? He linked generic FTC guidance concerning a  discretionary gray area. 

Ackman's hlf move was silly and idiotic and almost ended him. But illiterate children on Reddit are still defending it years after the fact when it's already said done and failed as if it was prudent. His entire strategy was based on lobbying the Obama administration to regulate hlf out of business. Say that out loud and try to rub your two braincells together and see why it sounds so ridiculous on it's face. Taking the other side of this trade was the easiest money Icann ever made.It's kind of funny the SPAC trades at a 10% premium. 

Levine wrote a good piece on how most SPACs are just a way to take a company public, but the better performing SPACs are ones where the sponsor acts as a PE type advisor.For those in the know...

1) What do you think about this? Is there something this piece misses, what will competitors do?

2) The article claims Jio's network is IP based and therefore has lower capital requirements than network that need to deliver older, voice, capabilities. Could a future shift cause this (displacement of incumbents with cheaper technology) to occur yet again? Maybe Elon Musk's Starlink service? 

3) Could someone do the same in the U.S.? Is it a lack of spectrum that limits activity here? If so, maybe what Ambani could get preferential access to is spectrum, and beat out other carriers that might be able to otherwise offer the same thing?

4) What are the negative perspectives on this? It seems very positive so I just want to understand some of the risks present.When future networking tech is talked about, I am not sure why Starlink is mentioned enough. Starlink by SpaceX is probably gonna revolutionize internet tech.

Either this or I don't understand Starlink correctly.I think the narrative in the article conceals quite a bit of information. Ambani achieved what he achieved, most likely, through corruption. All of the stuff he did wasn't possible for other providers (for example, carrying voice over data) because Ambani paid people off.

What Ambani did also wasn't some tech masterstroke, it was a function of the high levels of regulation in India (and his unique ability to ignore those regulations). All of the voice over data stuff occurs everywhere, in most countries (afaik) the issue is regulatory because there tends to have been a monopoly provider who owns exchanges/copper so voice over data is less about cheaper hardware but less friction (in most cases, your traffic is still going through those copper wires to an exchange...you just don't need to pay all the ludicrous "line rental" charges). The big issue in many countries is access. These services are mainly marketed to business but there is a concern about whether all retail customers will be able to use this service (where I am, the monopoly infrastructure provider is moving 100% to voice over data).

(Also, the article says that the govt generated revenue from this...no, they lost revenue because of the way providers pay the govt in India).

The other big "innovation" (again, not really) in this space is internet over mobile. So having your home broadband supplied by a mobile company (i.e. Sprint or whoever) which potentially works with 5G. The point is though that all the innovation is really in the point of contact with the customers and around the copper wires/exchanges/last mile part of the chain. All the backhaul stuff is basically unchanged. I have never found any of this to be that interesting tbh. It is a race to the bottom, and these companies are really just innovating in marketing...that is it (and backhaul fibre generally hasn't been a good investment, towers have because the economics are different).

Also, the point of the article really isn't about Jio but the splintering of the internet. This is definitely happening but it isn't really black and white. EU data protection rules really aren't some onerous threat to innovation...like it is your data, and you should be allowed to choose whether another company sells that data. A lot of this stuff is pretty much straight from Google's public policy division (if they are unable to target ads, their prices go down 10-20%...Google have been lobbying very aggressively on this but that surplus price is because they sell/collect your property).1. The main thing about Jio is this: Over the past few years, they have worked ground-up to become a monopoly. Their customer base is extremely large compared to any other competitor. Think about it- free internet for 3 months to millions of people. I saw it happen. They were very successful in acquiring a loyal base. 

2. Even if Starlink might cause disruption, it will be years from now and Jio will 100% find a way to partner as Reliance is always one step ahead of the game. So, I’m not worried about that at all. They have the cash and capacity to overpay just to cut out competition. 

3. America has a lot more competition in this space compared to India. Don’t know very well about the technicals but my guess is that it can be done. For eg: Facetime audio

4. The only negative aspect I see is it being priced in. Reliance stock is trading high rn but my guess is that it’s a good long term play. No regulatory burdens imo as Reliance is known to have a good affiliation with the current government and the current government will retain power in 2024 elections.>What do you think about this? Is there something this piece misses, what will competitors do?

I can try to answer this. I am not sure how people are claiming that Jio is a monopoly already, yes they are the market leader, early mover into internet apps ecosystem. But their market share is around 33% and the next competitors' Airtel is at 29% and Vodafone at 29%. 

Now I'm not quite aware of Vodafone but I think Airtel is not something you can dismiss so easily. Airtel's biggest strengths are:

1. Significant % of urban Indian elite are with Airtel and though that number is shrinking, it has not alarming.
2. Again in the B2B context, Airtel has a much better market share than Airtel and from what I know they are focusing on building a better B2B internet app ecosystem, unlike Jio which has a stronger B2C app ecosystem. While Airtel does have a good consumer app ecosystem, it is not easily understood as Hike, Wynk stand as independent units and not do brandish Airtel brand.
3. Airtel has better partnerships with global telcos unlike Jio with their top brass having done significant stints at British, Australian, and Singapore telcos.
4. Airtel is a market leader in many African countries too where they seem to be attempting the Jio model.

Beyond this, Airtel makes a great partner for Amazon to counter JioRetail and Airtel's B2B ecosystem to complement the AWS suite. Previously the Softbank group had invested in Airtel Africa and there were rumors of an investment in Airtel India too. It does not seem coincidental that Airtel's 5G partner Ericcson is the same as Softbank's 5G cloud vendor. 

I am not an expert, just someone who has made some observations.  
TL;DR Jio is not a monopoly yet and might see some significant competition but so far, Jio seems to be much more ambitious and well equipped.My understanding is it will be better for backhaul as opposed to direct user access, but maybe that will differ by region. In remote areas (rural, developing countries, etc.), it could be direct access.Satellite internet will never be competitive with fiber for urban or even surburban areas. The trade offs between latency and bandwidth are simply intractable.The EU data protections also are applied equally for any company with an EU citizen customer, US companies also have to foot the bill for the privacy protections.

In that respect I see a convergence of EU and US internet regulations over the long-term. The EU may claim it has concerns about technical surveillance by the US, though I think that is out of a misunderstanding by the EU High Court about how [EU governments similarly spy](https://www.lawfareblog.com/full-glare-european-hypocrisy-surveillance) upon their citizens. In that respect, I suspect recent rulings are more an attempt to get around the law to disrupt US corporate hegemons rather than to "advance" EU citizens rights.

The article also ignores an up and coming sector- Africa. The mobile approach in India (or Starlink) should similarly help connect the masses to the internet, and provide the economic benefits thereof. It would be a much more uneven application of laws, maybe a mix of the Chinese and US-EU construct amongst the dictatorships and emerging nations.>The main thing about Jio is this: Over the past few years, they have worked ground-up to become a monopoly.

Jio is projected to be a monopoly and isn't yet  [https://gadgets.ndtv.com/telecom/news/airtel-second-spot-trai-mobile-telecom-subscription-base-february-2020-reliance-jio-vodafone-idea-2254529#:\~:text=Top%20five%20telecommunication%20operator%20in,and%20MTNL%20(0.29%20percent).](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/telecom/news/airtel-second-spot-trai-mobile-telecom-subscription-base-february-2020-reliance-jio-vodafone-idea-2254529#:~:text=Top%20five%20telecommunication%20operator%20in,and%20MTNL%20(0.29%20percent).)These guys are never gonna get the 7 nm chip down, are they? Seriously beginning to lose confidence in this management. There's a reason companies are moving away from x86 architectureTruly sounding like a "Swan" song I guessHopefully their "data-centric" strategy (still not sure what that means after spending hours reading) will work out.It's not really moving away because of node size in intel's fabs tho.  Mostly the benefits of ARM is power and performance compared to x86.  Also, RISC-V is the new open source kid on the block that cuts license fees out of product budgets.Intel is in serious trouble for the next 3+ years. But the die was cast a while ago when they didn't cut their losses on 10 nm because their x86 dominance didn't provide much of a sense of urgency (as opposed to say AMD at death's door). Remember that Swan got the position because nobody else would take it.

They make a ton of money today because of ecosystem inertia, OEM fear, brand, and a huge amount of 14nm process that has terrific margins so long as there's strong demand for 14 nm chips.

If the best x86 market segments want something more than their 14 nm CPUs, what are they going to do? 10 nm performance, margins, and volume suck. 7 nm, the savior, is looking really fuzzy right now.

So, AMD has a clear runway and strong product roadmap execution for the next 3+ years in x86 (never mind Su vs. Swan). TSMC is crushing them on process, capacity, and has no strategic incentive to help Intel until they're much weaker. Custom ARM and RISC-V are strong platform design threats (a lot of which will be built by TSMC).

Now that 7 nm has been officially recognized by Intel as being at risk, Swan got brutalized on the analyst call. Not really much anybody could have done but just take it since it's just something he inherited. But he'll likely get pounded on 10nm and 7nm for every quarter going forward for \*years\*. That's going to do wonders for the investment thesis and enterprise customer confidence.> this management

The CEO that screwed 10nm was BK, not Bob Swan.

Not saying Bob won't mess this one though...Data centers probably (large server farms owned by big companies). Server chips, optane stuff, they also make some decent network cards.Correct me if I'm wrong, but a lot of performance is achieved by packing more transistors into the same surface area right?That's a fair statement, I exaggerated. But Intel's integrated approach is seriously hurting them now compared to the past 30+ years though.

First it was mobile by thinking they could create more efficient x86 chips than manufacturing ARM chips for the iPhone and lost. Then they made the same decision on non general-purpose processors like graphics; the Larrabee architecture was a faux-graphics chip that was again based on x86 and was pretty shitty/didn't meet a lot of use cases needed for GPUs today. Intel didn't want to play in that market so they took a half-assed approach. You're right that x86 isn't completely going away, AMD is doing well with the x64 instruction set and at the 7nm scale. Now the Mac is likely moving to ARM.

RISC-V will definitely further chip away at overall market share though. Companies will use that architure vs pay the fees to intel for some newer use cases, especially as we move further into edge computing and IoT devices.

I don't have any recommendation to buy or sell intel but their management has been frustrating recently. If you have any further insight, I'd love to hear it.Yeah I’m very much aware, I used to work under Bob Swan’s org (not at Intel) so I’ve been following him a bit but Bob has been part of Intel’s management for like 4 years now so he’s not completely off the hookYes and it's incorrect to say arm is higher performance than x86 anyway. Arm is higher performance per power (~flops/watt).

Also not sure I see many companies moving away from x86. I see a lot going to AMD but only a few shifting to an arm architecture.yes but dennards has broken down my guyat some point power requirements overtake size and inefficiency occurs. We have already hit that, hence why 7nm is not great in practice.I agree with you there.  Hardware market is becoming more domain specific with the rise of GPUs and other less dominant ASICs for applications like ML training or inference, specific DSP use cases, etc.  

As for investments, I dislike the direction intel took too.  I think the enduring long term investments would be the semiconductor fabs like TSMC or semiconductor equipment or service provisers like say ASML or teradyne.  I think this is what I believe but I'm am still not certain if this is a good allocation of capital.  Do you have any specific approaches to investment in semiconductor markets?The threat to x86 is that that the customers with the largest scale (Amazon, China) and/or integration benefits (Apple) have an incentive to design their own chip and have someone else fab them.

But a shrinking x86 market is still very juicy for AMD and TSMC but terrible news for Intel long-term.I do not

I looked into the cost of flash nand manufacturing and spinning disks manufacturing before, but not costs specific of high technology manufacturing like semi conductors

All I know is the semi conductor supply chain is vertically disintegrated in many cases because just how expensive these factories are, giving rise to firms like TSMC and Global Foundries (the manufacturing spin off of AMD, also acquired IBMs manufacturing)

These companies consume so much capex, which increases as technology becomes more advanced, that there will probably be more m&a in the future. I bet there are bankers right now valuing all of intel’s manufacturing assets now after Swan’s comments about potentially outsourcing the process. Going to see the pros/cons of selling the assets or spin off into another company for increased competition in the spaceIf you're trying this as a summer project accessible to "the everyday person", you might lose them on the more technical aspects of moats and potentials. 

Also I'm confused by this post. Are you asking a question about a system you're developing? Or are you showing us that you know these things? It's confusing. 

Taking the first paragraph as truth -- you're going to want to codify this into easy-to-fill answers. It's like Peter Lynch says -- if you can't explain it to a fifth grader, you don't know the business. 

Maybe make a 5th Grader Investor Summary. That exercise will help you understand the business on a deeper level and get away from the technical (non everyday person) language. 

Overall, a bit confused as to what you're looking for here.“Competition Demystified” by Bruce Greenwald, “Competitive Strategy” by Michael Porter, and “Measuring a Moat” by Michael Mauboussin (blog). 

It seems like you have a solid grasp over parts of competitive advantage analysis, but it’s be helpful to strengthen that understanding before setting out a framework for others. A good test to start by creating a framework for yourself to work off of, and then refine that with practice over time before adapting it to those who are less financially literate.

Good luck!is this a summary of a book or something? What is the question exactly? About whether that's a good framework?"Efficient Scale or toll moat: Only a few players can enter a market and be successful. Mastercard's competitors, namely Visa, have no interest in undercutting Mastercard as doing so would only hurt their profits and margins. Instead, they function in a healthy, stable duopoly to preserve their market share and profits. This grants high barriers to entry for any company trying to enter the payment network space."

&#x200B;

This isn´t intuitive. How would maintaining high prices constitute a moat?This CS report might be helpful for you as well https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nMfWjIz2lFBJykOT9N6hS9-zh5Ln1lA7/view?usp=drivesdkI believe your moat categories are not 100% right, you might want to take a look at my initial post on moats here: [https://searching4value.wordpress.com/2020/07/09/my-initial-thoughts-on-competitive-advantages-and-economic-moats/](https://searching4value.wordpress.com/2020/07/09/my-initial-thoughts-on-competitive-advantages-and-economic-moats/)  


Or look some videos from Dorsey (links to be found in my post)I understand your confusion and sorry for not making it clear. I am inquiring about the relevance and usefulness of the "system" I'm developing AND I am developing this for "the everyday person" who has little exposure to investing but is eager to learn more/wants to get started and wants short investment ideas.

Because of this Covid-19 pandemic, I can't run the student fund I usually run in person for the foreseeable future (I can manage the fund itself but communicating with new members, it's going to be difficult). I go to a Liberal Arts school and most students don't have a lot of exposure to investing but have a desire to learn about it.

I want to develop a framework for students/people to be able to analyze companies and share their ideas in a standardized form that encapsulates the overall research process online. Because it's online, I naturally would want it to expand it beyond my school hence this post.

If a person can understand the moats of a company or lack thereof, how they make money and how solid/protected are their revenue streams, the direction is the company going in, any obstacles and risks they may face, and a reasonable price to buy its shares, then its reasonable to say they understand the business and can make an informed decision on whether or not they want to invest in the company or not. 

This framework isn't meant to turn people into investment gurus or anything but people who are interested in investing should be able to actively participate in the research process and share that with each other. I just want to point them in a direction that could help them start the research process. By having a framework, it will force them to understand the business and therefore hedge against their emotions amidst the day-to-day volatility of the stock market and just focus on investing strong companies with durable moats for long periods of time. If they're wrong about the investment, they can understand where they went wrong and hopefully identify these weaknesses to exit in time. 

While investing certainly isn't for everyone, I believe that there should be more opportunities for people to learn about investing beyond its philosophy and actually dig into companies they buy from or can understand. Sure Peter Lynch (amongst other investors) has vouched that the individual investor has many advantages over a fund manager but not many people/college students are going to read a book to get started on investing. It's sad but true. You can argue that these people shouldn't invest but I just want to make investing more accessible and exciting for people.

Of course, if they're serious about investing they'll educate themselves, read books, find investment channels and this framework isn't meant to replace that.

I hope this clarifies both what I was trying to get at in my post and why I'm doing it.I should have made this clearer in my post. **I am trying to develop a "fill in the blank" framework and a platform to discuss for people who are interested in investing in stocks (want to learn to invest)**. I run an investment club in my college where many students are eager to learn how to invest in stocks but are intimidated by reading annual reports and the world of investing in general; I go to a liberal arts college and while there are econ majors we don't have finance majors so many people see investing as daunting/confusing/farfetched. What many of them don't realize is that their academic backgrounds and interests give them unique/valuable insights to many companies, but there is a huge mental (and knowledge) barrier for them when it comes to investing.

By developing a framework, I want to simplify the research process for both the person trying to analyze the company and the person on the other side reading the analysis and show that anyone can invest with the right mind and framework (that it isn't rocket science that only people in wall street can do). This is not too dissimilar from Morningstar's equity analyst reports but the goal is to have it more open-ended, simple, and user friendly. While there are many books that have touted this, I want to help students actually analyze, dissect, and discuss companies. 

I guess I have a few questions that I didn't make explicit. Do you think this framework can be used to help the everyday person a better, more informed investor? Is this an effective and universal enough framework to analyze an investment opportunity/company, especially for people who are just beginning to learn about investing even if they don't have any intentions to go into the industry?Since it's a duopoly, the customers have no alternative and therefore buy your service anyway. It's obviously an advantage for the 2 companies to have their prices "floored".I'd be inclined to argue what might be an unpopular perspective on this sub: investment into individual stocks is emphatically not something the average college student or graduate should ever be doing. 

My own personal opinion goes a good deal further - I'm bearish on whether there's any point in almost anyone trying to outperform the index - but even someone who disagrees with that perspective may well agree that nonspecialist undergrads should really not be trying to beat the market on the price of a given stock. 

The market is not perfect, and I would never claim that it is. But I do think that everyone would agree that there is a knowledge base below which a given individual has no business trading, and I'd argue quite forcefully that college students fall well below that threshold. In fact, I'd go further and argue that anyone who doesn't have at least a reasonable grasp of financial mathematics should be nowhere near trading shares.I don't need to read this to be able to tell you that these aren't two conglomerates: one is a diversified industrial conglomerate and the other is an oligopolistic online advertising business whose controlling shareholders direct slush funds to fun projects.Fun fact is that that large private equity firms are actually conglomerates, even though they claim other companies should focus on core businessesVery good paper. Great structure. 

However,  GE will rise again. Too big to fail. Too important to be scrapped with the likes of the fly by nights.You don't need to read this because there was nothing to be learned...seriously just skim it and you'll see it's pretty basicOne has the blessing of Higher Powers, the other has lost favour.

Otherwise you are correct.Maybe when they get rid of their CEO?Are you aware that they have a good one now?I was not.Ultimately these DIPs are a continuation of the trend of DIP lenders vying for equity control, just the way that is approached is different on the term sheet.Most DIP loans are from vulture funds... Having to strategize an investment of a loan to own of distressed bankrupt companies.LATAM shareholders trying to keep control of the company in this manner appears like a pretty egregious violation of absolute priorityI agree, both the bondholder & knighthead objections make a very good argument supporting your point and I suspect the financing wont work. 

From a high level, the LATAM DIP fits in with DIPs that seek equity control via aggressive milestone terms, collateral, or preferential access to rights offerings, etc. A topic I've been personally interested in over the last several months.There’s a very interesting article written in the 90s in the Harvard business review that suggested the success of SBC for a CEO in an organisation was dependant on how sensitive the CEOs total wealth is to changes in stock price of the company. Warren buffet being the classic example of this where his personal wealth varies almost entirely in lockstep with the price of Berkshire. Whereas CEOs who received large SBC packages but their personal wealth varies little with the price of their company implies they have diversified their wealth away from the company and therefore aren’t incentivised properly or reflect internal information about the companies true performance underneath accounting figures. 

This is something I certainly think about a lot in analysing companies but have found it hard to gather the data often.CHTR?

Back when they were still undergoing the huge integration with TWC, stock was depressed in the 200s and 300s. Rutledge's pay had contingencies on stock going to mid 400s and 500s if I recall correctly.Berkshire has used sbc to buy stock. I believe it was two times, and only because the other company wasn't happy with cash. Unfortunately i can't remember the names of the companies. Anyway, buffett said he would have preferred to purchase with cash.

And yes, if i have no other information available, I definitely don't have much confidence in a random company using sbc.Netflix was heavy on paying some employees exclusively in stock options. They had the choice to go 100% stocks or partly with a base salary.I wouldn't care either way. What matters is the change in shares outstanding. SBC is bad if the company is just letting it go unchecked but most companies try to buy back at least as many shares as they issue for compensation.Amazon is notorious for using heavy amounts of SBC as part of employee comp. the highest salary at the firm is something like $180K...everything else is stock/RSU’s. Stock has done well but would have done much better if it hadn’t been diluted so much over the years.Yes, I also think that founders that are still part of the day to day activities like Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs when he was around and Bill Gates few years ago also actually think like owners and not just as temporary CEOs.Dexter shoe was one of them. And it turned out to be a disaster because he didnt evaluate their competition correctly.> What matters is the change in shares outstanding.

Care to elaborate? Do you mean mass dilution is what matters?That’s wrong about the dilution.  Look at the share count over time.  Amazon is actually a great example of how to use stock comp.  $160k is max salary and new employees are given a RSU package that vests 5/15/20/20 over 4 years.  Average employee leaves after 2 years...so it would seem that at amazon working conditions are so poor, many would forgo half of their SBC to get their life back.That, they get pushed out for bad performance, or another company recruits them and makes them whole on RSU.woofI am not familiar with the author. But having an annualized growth since inception at about half the S&P doesn’t cause me to put aside other readings for this..This guy is a self obsessed, pretentious douche. I emailed him a a few years ago and you’d think I asked Warren Buffett for a lunch date based on his response.

Why does this guy write like a college sophomore?
>Like Garrett’s,
Kontoor’s CEO is dynamic and has repeatedly surprised me by acting intelligently. But Kontoor had a
number of advantages over Garrett: bankruptcy was far less likely, Kontoor had already gotten covenant
relief, Kontoor’s business does not face existential threats (everyday jeans are here to stay, with
turbochargers… time will tell), and one of Kontoor’s insiders had recently purchased shares.
Kontoor does not have quite as much upside if things go as I expect, but there are more ways to lose with
Garrett, and losing with Garrett is more likely to involve a wipeout for shareholders. Comparing the two,
Kontoor appeared to be a better bet than GarrettIt may be like Bill Ackman where you need to give him a few years before the thesis manifests.I see his twitter comments now and then and I could not agree more.

High degree of personal success relative to competence. [https://www.reddit.com/user/likethereligion/](https://www.reddit.com/user/likethereligion/) 

This is his reddit username \^, found it long time ago. He has great youtube content and I love reading his letters. I think his investment in GTX was a mess just from the start.If the reason your tenant is going out of business is because they owe you money, you can buy them for very cheap in bankruptcy and forgive their debts. You could end up with some decent assets. 

You also save yourself from actually having to recognize those losses in your financial statements.Surprised no one has mentioned co-tenancy issues here yet. To me thats the big reason why you as the Landlord would rescue an anchor like JC Penny. I'd bet a huge chunk of the smaller yet sophisticated tenants in the malls have clauses in their lease where if JC Penny or any anchor goes down, a portion of their rent is abated.

Some off the cuff guesses:

1) It looks like the acquisitions are often for anchor tenants. Anchor tenants pay the least per square foot but drive your pricing power on other tenants, especially on a longer lived lease. So it’s normal for a strip mall for example to have something like 70% of revenue driven by only 30-40% of space. I remember in one extreme case the last 20% of space was probably worth 45% of revenue. By owning the anchor tenant, you are increasing the potential “yield” you collect on the property
2) given the environment , if Retail owners have a speculative eye to be opportunistic, there’s a strong argument that they have the best information advantage. They have foot traffic statistics, business understanding, site placement 
3) capital flow prioritization. A retailer can buy the business and prioritize its capital flows to rent payments. As an independent entity it may elect to attempt a lease break or rent non payment.Dude, this link sucks.Haven’t read about this but one reason could be to repurpose their properties (I.e. convert big box retail stores to warehouses/other industrial facilities). Could be pretty lucrative if you buy cheap enough.

Can you provide some example acquisitions?Probably for the real estate.Experience Showrooms for fashion, electronics, toys, ect. No in-store purchases, except by delivery

Shipping/Recieving for pick-ups & returns (cheaper than paying FedEx & UPS)

Carry-Out Only for consumers and food delivery companies from major food chains like Chipotle & Panera Bread.

Office Space (this was actually happening before the pandemic, not sure how solid that plan in now since most office workers are at home now)Probably because they don't have a competent biostatistician on the payroll. This question is sort-of akin to why did people buy Hertz after it declared bankruptcy. People make poor decisions all the time.  Same, with a decade ago when companies started buying distressed malls. History of full of people making bad decisions.Number 1 is false, these arent anchor tenants. Idc what an article says, nobody would classify forever 21 or brooks brothers as an anchor tenant.

Number 3 is the answer. The RE firms are just trying to shore up the balance sheets of the clients that take up a lot of real estate space, and that money is going to flow back to them anyway. They aren't buying all the bankrupt retailers, just the best ones for them. No REIT is gonna buy J Crew. They're going to attempt to turn around these stores by actually downsizing themNo he means Simon buys forever 21 for example. They don't have independent locationsNone of the companies being bought have real estate assets!!

Can people stop replying if they don't know the answer wtfOh my. This seems like a terrible idea.[removed]Dude how many REITs are acquiring retailers? Literally only two: Simon and Brookfield

Novavax jumped 25% on funding news but their market cap is 8 billionThe [context](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/health/covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-moderna-pfizer.html) for this is that the government is trying to prevent potential price-gouging. Pfizer was the wild card because they didn’t take government funding up front. But now they have struck a deal and agreed not to sell the vaccine for a profit. Moderna is the sole remaining company who claims they will profit from their vaccine but they lack any leverage to actually do so. I don’t understand why anyone is bullish on any of these companies. It’s good PR for them if they succeed but there’s little money in it.Watch it go up and drop down at the end of the day.So excited for my 7/31 $34.50c that I bought for $0.84!At least one analyst has a target price for Pfizer at $53 per share. It's currently trading at around $38.20.  The price target was before this announcement, so it could go up from that. I'd say it's a good time to be buying PFE for the short-term and mid-term (up to the next 4 to 6 months).About to throw it all on $PFE.I would say yes, super bullishGood thing for me since my uncle gave me pfe stocks 15 years ago damn.Pfizer also has like 50 other drugs in the testing pipeline so even if Covid vaccine doesn’t pan out, they’ve got other drugs that could be successful for the company.The government is basically paying the pharmacy to go ahead and produce their candidates long before approval. If they don't get approved, it's the governments loss not the companies. And if they do get approved, then they're ready to go quickly after. Because how disheartening would it be if in  January (just to name a random month), a company along with the CDC and FDA announced there was a 100% safe and effective vaccine now developed, but it would still take a year to produce enough of. 

So I take it with a grain of salt. Their vaccine shows enough promise for the Fed to fund some production, but thats about all.7/31 39.5 calls worked out well, in at .15, out at .52.Not least surprised.  This is one of the oldest American pharma started in Brooklyn in America.Sold PFE stock at 35. because I thought it would take a dip again, I'm an idiot. HOLD 4 the winThey're doing it with everyone. AZN is next.I work in pharma advertising and we are allowed to invest in every stock on the market EXCEPT those that are clients of ours ... guess who one of our biggest clients is ... smhprice they bill your insurance for it? $eleventy millionUntil we have concrete evidence of a safe, working vaccine, I’m not buying into these pharmaceutical companies. We’ve seen this numerous times already with other pharmaceutical companies (MRNA is coming to mind.) Some news is published about a vaccine trial, the stock shoots up over hope and speculation, then it slowly drops back down in price in the days following.  I think we’re at least a year away from a vaccine. Production and distribution will take quite a bit of time and I don’t necessarily want to keep my capital tied up that long over pure speculation.Does their vaccine work? Any side-effects that we should know about?And this ladies and gentlemen is why you buy and hold.How the rich maintains wealth🙃I don't think the vaccine will come from pharma (in the US specially) but instead will come from a university in Europe. Most pharma companies here are better at pumping and dumping stock than actually making anything.

I have been investing in biotech since 5-6 years, back when INO was promising a treatment for cancer. Never happened. I doubt a COVID vaccine will happen either.Do they even have a proven vaccine? Seems like the government is more interested in a market moving headline.So single payer vaccine? Guess it does work after all100 million when we need over 300 million... and just wait, I bet tons of people will not be down to take the vaccine. Dont get your hopes up.Literally every major vaccine player has gotten paid by the US govt for their vaccine. 

People are making it a bigger deal than it is.How does this affect tesla?Should I buy a call to this or no.Because Pfizer needs the help I guess?I believe Covid Vaccine will be available very soon at many countries but I am doubt about the effectiveness. They will be there just for political reason, to calm down people.the vaccines will be freeMrna vaccines never been successful so chances this works out are not greatI am def NOT getting that vaccineSo all that money I pumped into Moderna 2 weeks ago is worthless now?$19.50 seems "bit much" for a vaccine that will be manufactured and sold in billions of units.So they don't have a vaccine but they'll given money to find one and make 100million? sounds great for them, if they don't find one they'll still get paid.Rocking 57 $.04 $60 1/15 calls. If the thing passes $60 I will be heckin rolling in itWhat does the term "zombie" mean to you figuratively?


I'll start; brain dead.[deleted]so when would they actually pay out for this? is this something where if the vaccine ends up working and getting FDA approval they would buy 100 million doses, or is this something where they'd be buying large quantities of doses during the testing phase as well?

if it's the latter, why did pfizer get selected over all the other drug manufacturers working on vaccines? (hell, even if it's the former, what's so special about pfizer?)Pharma is murky rn. Whichever will manufacture the vaccine first will be bullish; others will be bearish as the hype about pharma dies down.Because no one has ever promised something they weren't able to deliver. Are there even 100 million people that haven’t gotten infected yetGawd damn it, bought at 96.6, sold at 100.5Wait, does this mean the vaccine is nearly complete?Genuine question. What happens when a company produces a successful vaccine? 
Do all the other vaccine companies go down or do they benefit as well?Genuine question. What happens when a company produces a successful vaccine? 
Do all the other vaccine companies go down or do they benefit as well?Same option as since the start, there is no long stock profit to be made from this it is a short term profit.  You need to get in there early and then wait for the average stock buyer to go in there and pump up the stock on news and sell before people think out the actual profit to the company.

Companies are not going to profit from this.  They will need to sell at near cost and other countries will not protect the legal rights of the company and will manufacturer it once the process is known.Glad I bought some shares at the bottom. Plan on holding for a long time though.Yep. Sold it today. If that isn't going to move it, then I'll move it to something in the meantime that will. Nothing short of a cure will that bitch.Got myself a put 36 July 31 lol, at 37¢ it was hard not make that call. Counting on the fact that these stocks are usually volatile, it's month end and it's been slowly edging upwards since long enough now. Plus, one big news from moderna or others could deal it a 5% blow easily. July 31 is a bit ambitious, but I'd be willing to take a shot for a potential 3.5kMust be the big news he referred too yesterday.I take from it they only ordered enough for a third of the US population....I don't own Pfizer but as others have said, it's already a large company. It seems like this might be a good long-term play because if they produce results by December(I think that's what I saw in the report for a timeframe), then it'll go up. It's still a little bit of a gamble because of FDA tests, effective treatment, etc etc.Twenty bucks apiece DOES sound cheap enough. Now, as long as they don't "surcharge" them up to a hundred each...Here's the problem, it's not proven in widescale tests to work without side effects yet.

Just like how the anthrax vaccine was found to be faulty and cause more serious side effects.

Need that first before things can go back.Could it be immoral in any way to invest in Pfizer now?But what if the vaccine doesn't work?It's not just Pfizer it is also BNTX! Read the news lol.If their upcoming 3rd phase trial gets approved and shows positive signs this could jump both stock tickets up a lot more.Well thank goodness we didn't fold into socialized medicine! Just a good old-fashioned billion dollar corporate donation.We don't even have reliable tests yet. How can there be a vaccine?When you knew this was gonna happen so you invested in Pfizer about a month agoHow long will it take?I was already holding Pfizer when this popped hahah, I had a really sucky day  my account was getting a bad day I was slightly down on Pfizer 
But my theory was.. “well the U.K. govt came to a deal with them, someone else will too”
Anyway went for a piss came back and my account was like up loads which I thought was odd (actually thought one of my less good positions had triggered a margin call and been chucked...) thx Pfizer! You make my day goo!Are they still forcing that malaria drug into vets at the VA to treat nothing?They pumped more into the stock market. Its pretty obvious where the priorities areLooks like I picked the right stock to shortRidiculous. We will definitely come up with a vaccine soon, right after the elections are done. mark my words.Thats 19.95 per vaccine,  so depending on what the cost is to the patient it sounds cheap.... now if the charge $200 a dose to consumers ....Big Pharma becoming super rich with this pandemic.So is the contact void if the vaccine turns out to not work?Good Lord I hope they get approval for this vaccine soonSo what if Moderna, Gilead, or any of the many vaccine pumped stocks beat Pfizer to a vaccine ?> What do you take from this news?

My take is that some politicians got paid tens of thousands to get this money to Pfizer and they won't be delivering this vaccine any time soon if ever.What is the Pfizer vaccine based on? The Oxford one seems pretty safe to me. At this point from what I know about both, I think I'd rather have the oxford vaccine. I trust a college more than I do a pharm company to be honestThat 2 billion is being split between pfe and bntx.

Pfe is already a huge stock with a market  cap  of 214 b.
Bntx has a market cap of 23.8 b.Yeah, I'm not taking it. Would only be a short term pump and dump.More like super bullshit. Germ theory of disease is a lie! It’s all about terrain theory.awesomeStocks aside, why do we need an allocation for 500 million when our population is around 330 million?I believe they will only pay this money to Pfizer once they have a vaccine that has passed the final stages of testing and has been approved.Pfizer is gonna dumpIt better be free for every American considering this.Pfizer is a good company and pays fairly generous dividends. Watch this! [Pfizer stock](https://youtu.be/mHASTMNksSA)Rallied today,now back at square one. Optimistic for 40$+This will impact pfzer stock marginally. They already have montly renevue far greater than a couple of billions.Why is $PFE falling so much the last two days? I have 8-07 calls that are getting hammered. Should I roll them or Hope next week Turns around?Ah so this is why corona came about[deleted]Does that mean I need to invest in themGoing down wtfI recommended  Pfizer on here a few months ago. A  Genius here  was critical and stated I was wrong as Pfizer hadn't did anyhting  for a few years. Lookit up. It is really hard to tell anyone here anything because the immature and clueless  political hackers on here are destroying  an otherwise  board to encourage   Stock Market advice. They aren't interested in making money and probably don't have any to invest anyway. This is the only way they can feel important even if it id mis-information.This is all crazy. The vaccine bubble will burst.Wait there’s a vaccine??!Extremely scary.  Anyone trying to force a vaccine on me, will get it in the eye.I mean if we’re just buying vaccine candidates, I got some tasty cake frosting which will definitely kill you from diabetes before you die of covid.Why Pfizer?I'm not buying on this news. There were pharma companies scrambling to make a vaccine for SARS1 back in 2003. It was never released - not because it was particularly scientifically challenging to make a vaccine, but rather by the time the vaccine had been developed and clinical trials were to be planned, the virus had run its course and very few people were still dying from it. We are on the same trajectory with COVID. Either it has mutated into a weaker version, or else society has seen enough exposure that we are developing resistance on the way to immunity. Governments might splurge on a round of vaccinations, but they probably won't be lining up for a second round after nowhere near 100 million people opt for the first round.The vaccines are all for the market hype. They in effect will have little  change in immunization of the population.So when can i get the shot? LolWeird that we paid PFE when there isn't even a working vaccine yet. There have been promising trials, but we're still 6-9 months away from a vaccine, unless you are to believe we'll have one in a few months. Good luck with that.so enough for all the rich sports organizations.The vaccine technically won’t matter? Study released last night showed virus antibodies are immune systems develop rapidly become useless. Not like other viruses.look at BioNtech fundamental, its valuation is quite insane isn't it?Yup. This guy knows! I got in at $92 yesterday and it's $99/100 pre-market right now. Debating to get out my position or HODL.So when govt purchases these doses, do they give it out for free?  They give it to hospitals, but do they charge them? I’m just curiousBrrrrDaaaaamn....When this “vaccine” turns out to be fraud, pretty sure it will be more like France In 1792 with Louis the xviAll I remember is the dog and Will Smith is a cuck now.Don't enable antivaxers please.wait how so?Here is a quote from an article it.  I can visualize the classic beginning scene of 70% of apocalyptic movies where the below quote is being red out by a newscaster on the tv while the main character is cooking his family breakfast.

“Vaccine manufacturers like Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and others have been ramping up manufacturing capacity before their vaccine's have been proven to be safe and effective and before receiving regulatory approval. That will help shave months off the time it takes to ultimately distribute a vaccine across the globe.”If they test it on 10,009 patients, run for the hills!!Was that Will’s last good movie?I'm gonna watch I am Legend now cause of this commentI was thinking the same exact thing, throughout this whole pandemic.Uh oh.Stocks are pretty flat rn. Disappointing I thought it would be much higher. Maybe tomorrow it will pop.Long on Pfizer and this Frikin pos stock has been side ways trading the entire time I have had it - like no massive drops or gains .. pisses me off, but I would say Bullish short term for sure .Can someone explain how this happens, i’m new to investing, is it because people are putting in “buy at open” ordersPfizer has a lot of expenses too. Valuation needs to be based on more than just current events, IMO. What other drugs does it have in the pipeline? What's failed to advance in trials recently? 

I don't think pharma is going to make lots of money on these vaccines.Like we're living in a time where valuation statistics are what drives stock surges and not just what's the popular company of the week.  /sWtf there is a vaccine for covid??

Edit: Lol why am I being downvoted?? First time I hear about a vaccine for Covid and I ask wait a minute what?? ..during a global pandemic, and you are down voting me ?

lol wtf?

Edit edit: lol people are replying that this vaccine is going to turn me into a zombie and I’m getting down voted for asking that there’s a vaccine? Lmao wtf is wrong with societyWell its the first batch which is non profit. But the rest during the coming years are at profit mate. Also PFE has a lot of other medical products which recieves more attention and the firm recieves PR.Moderna now has a platform that can revolutionize all vaccines.  No fermentation, no 4000 liter cultures, just a nucleic acid synthesis machine (which I ran in grad school after literally 10 minutes of training) and maybe an adjuvant.  No one wanted to make the big shift into mRNA vaccines until now, but now we know they are safe and efficacious.I think this is going to be more a longer rollercoaster, but still + at EOD because it wasn’t priced in earlier unlike the AZN newsWatch Pfizer announce their vaccine doesn’t pass clinical trials and the stock goes up for no reason.I would say buy later in the day. For the past few days, PFE has jumped in pre-trading and then declined through the day.  Buy within an hour of market closing.go for BNTX instead!So you can get those sweet divs off a subsidized vaccine that wont make a profit?Wait for "falsified results". This coming this winterHappy Cake Dayi don't get this happy cake day...too late to ask?Not too late, get on in there!FDs as well?Are you allowed to own funds that hold PFE?Those questions are what clinical trials are for.

There isn't a way to answer without first giving it to someone because side effects are a reaction to the vaccine.you don't need 1 vaccine for every person in the country, you need to take care of the densely populated cities most of the smaller cities that are less populated will work themselves out.*subsidizedEven without vaccine, Pfizer is still one of the most successful pharma companies around. It feels like a safe purchase at this valuation with a massive chance for a huge boost if the vaccine hits the market.Expand?Not only that every single company has every single reason to skew results in their favor because there will be no oversight and too much pressure.   I probably won't even want to put a vaccine in my body until the first one has had it in their body for 2 years.retardNo vaccine is released yet, Moderna might release one first... But judging from their track record my moneys on Pfizer (literally).Afirm> So it comes to 19k per vaccine? Someone correct my math?

$1,950,000,000 / 100,000,000 == $19.50.

we're talking like twenty bucks, not 20 grand.I believe there can be multiple versions.  Who knows how fda approvals work.  Seen a lot of negative on that part.  I’m sure some out here are more informed.  I am definitely interested also to hear.Donation? You're suggesting Pfizer should offer them for free?Vaccines are been made now, if they are good and get approval, they are ready to go.LongIt's 500 million doses.. I believe Pfizer's vaccine is 2 doses per individual. Each vaccine being developed has a different dose requirement.> Optimistic for 40$+
I am with you. The AH trading do give an idea how strong PFE is. All is red except a few.2bil/100mil=20$I don't think it's going to be mandatory, just like the flu shot isn't. 
BTW, [almost half](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/coverage-1819estimates.htm) of US adults took a flu shot last year.
It is enough for a majority to develop immunity. How effective the shot is and how long that immunity lasts is still to be discovered.as I understand is Sars1 is deadlier but not as contagious and "maintainable" as Covid.

what i meant is i think covid will still be around next and many more years.I just looked at the contract. Buy biontech gets 500 million for completing the project. And anywhere between 10 + 20% probably in royalties. There is 2.5 billion already under contract. At the current share price and number of shares with those calculations I got a eps of about 20. I don't think that's not crazy compared to other tech companies.I bought 100 shares at the dip in March, holding out until trump is out office because he’s going to keep throwing money into it haha8% profits sounds pretty goodjust dip bro you know that’s the moveI bought some Biotech stocks at 92 dollars per share yesterday as well.

Not sure if I should buy some more to just continue to hold.HODLIt’s much more than that now. I guess I missed the boat. Last few times I tried to buy good news I was left holding the bag. I move too slow.For the other medicine they have been handing them out to the states and the states decide where to send them.  Based on population of the state not need.

It looks like the original plan from the federal government was  that they were going to track need with hospitals sending numbers to the Department of Health and Human Services but that looks to be killed when the media decided to make it a hit piece.It's ridiculous they are allowed to come out with statements like we are 90% certain we will have a vaccine within 6 monthsAre you assuming that it's going to be fraud or just hoping?Lol when it turns out to be fraud? Lol stick to what you know big guy, which seems to be nothingLol I don't think Will, will have a tough time pulling assBig Cucky Style

You think Denzel would let him have at least one.If you're reading this message right now, you are not alone.Well it’s a huge company with 50 billion in revenue already, can’t really expect 2 billion from this vaccine to really move the needle.put in a call order. It jumped at opening asking a lot....Aren't sideways stocks one of the easier albeit time consuming ones to consistently make money on?no kidding. Not going to do much.It's a defensive stock, it doesn't move much ever. Also their debt is eating up a chunk of their profits.
On top of that pharma companies are expansive to run and they can have multiple medications that get rejected after having pushed millions into them[deleted]I work at one of the sites on the East Coast. A lot of expenses is an understatement. Its a race to the finish.  There are I think 5-15 vaccines in the US that are in in trialsAt least four companies are optimistic they will have one by the end of the year. The valuation for Moderna is pricing in not only the success of their vaccine but their ability to price gouge and get minimum $5B a year from it, when Pfizer just agreed to take only $2B.There have been several for a month or more. Tricky thing though, they need quite a bit of testing before you inject them into a billion people. I think there were two companies that said they will begin manufacturing before trials are complete because they are pretty sure it works. But even though they are willing to manufacture at risk, they still cant skip all the testing steps.There are multiple teams with vaccines in the works. Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Oxford-AdtraZeneca. They're all undergoing expedited trials right now, the most optimistic release timeframe for any of them would be late 2020.People caring about getting upvoted/downvoted is what’s wrong with society> Lmao wtf is wrong with society

You're the one on an internet forum refusing to use the actual internet to research basic topics like, idk, the news?A “vaccine” that hasn’t gone through the rigorous tests and trials that a typical vaccine would go through before being approved for the public. This is how we all become zombie monsters a year from now but fuck it, I’ll roll the dice, hope for the best and get vaccinated and possibly zombiefied.I downvoted because everyone else didWhy the downvotes? All the MRNA data is good from the dozens of trialsI wouldn’t even be madHindsight is 20/20.  PFE climbed all day after the early profit takers sold off in the morning.Why do you think they will be falsified? Do either company have a recent history of doing this?Thank you! Happy cake day to you as wellCake day is your Reddit anniversary. It shows up as a cake iconIt's your Reddit birthday.Great dividend too.Moderna has never successfully brought a vaccine to market. Confirmed yesterday when a Congresswoman directly asked Moderna this and they fumbled for an answerNot op, but from my VERY limited understanding is that coronaviruses are constantly mutating (like the cold) so it's near impossible that one vaccine will work as an end all be all.There's 2 types of virus classes ... The one that coronavirus is, is the more rapidly changing and less stable structure.. so it's naturally harder to make a vaccine for something that is less stableYeah I'll get a vaccine but not till after others do it first and it shows that it is safe and effective.Yes I'm the retard for not getting a vaccine that's been rushed through, meanwhile, yet another study of antibody tests have shown 10x more people have had covid than previously thought, proving it's even safer, again. Lol. Blow me bitchIn terms of who is the [farthest in development](https://grufity.com/dashboards/1594793452245/Who-will-develop-the-first-coronavirus-vaccine) \- AstraZeneca and Oxford Univ are currently in Phase 2/3 trials and Moderna hopes to start Phase 3 by the end of the monthIm aware that there are literally hundreds of companies working on a vaccine and any one of them could be first. I've heard most about Moderna a lot the last few weeks and thought I could spare a few hundred to take a chance on them. I have some Pfizer from even before all this because they are one of the biggest and most stable. Im not too worried about either one not finding the vaccine first, they will both be fine in the long run even if they don't strike gold this yearWe're already paying for it... Twice.
Government bailout and inflated insurance (not to mention the uninsured who'll be treated anyway). Our institutions are failing, corporate profits impede the right to healthcare, and Pfizer is still being sued for millions for creating the opioid crisis. If companies need to be bribed and sued to do the right thing, maybe there's a better way, e.g., every single payer system.I’m shorting MRNAThanks for the insightThat's assuming they complete the project.Quantitative Easing for the win.So your holding for over 4 yrs ?You’ll be holding for another 4 years.Not for someone who uses ‘hodl’8% a day will grow the wealth they say...What does HODL mean?

This is the type of shit sales guy say after misrepresenting an overly casual scientist says in a meetingWhyYeah the only time that you can guarantee that you'll have a cure in 6 months is if you had it in the last 6 months.No way. Delays out the wazoo.It’s even more ridiculous that people actually believe statements like that. I guess the media just hype up fake news.What if this was all population control?🤔Worst part is knowing your cheater wife can take more than half your shit and turn you into Brendan Fraser at a whim, and he can't do shit about it.Mans definitely banged Margot RobbieHe's got a beautiful wife tho :oDoubtfulAnti-max movement was intitiated in part by a PE/angel investorYes and this is an emergency circumstance unlike anything we've seen in our lifetimes, now with better medical knowledge of how to gauge immune system response, and scientists collaborating on a worldwide scale unlike anything before. I place my faith in the medical experts to put out a product that is safe when it is ready, not Karens and Chads on the internet fear mongering science.Jumping in here as a biologist to just educate people that vaccines are typically extremely safe, and theres literally no way these doomsday sci fi things are possible. Like it wouldnt even make sense biologically in any way.

It's sad that vaccines have become a "hot button" issue, because they are literally a modern miracle of medicine.Meh.  I'd rather be a vampire anyway.  At least they get out at night.  \* Rolling up my sleeve. \*Big deal with that vaccine was it was a "viral cure". A virus was engineered to make people immune to cancer. Well it mutated and spread turning them into the zombie things.this vaccine could have fatal effects since the trials have been so short and we don't know what will happen to people after a year that they get the vaccine?Obviously you didn't watch HancockInterestingly it bumped up an extra 25% over the percent revenue increase.Noob to investing here. Why's that?Yeah if any other company got news like that $1.95 Billion from the feds they would probably go up a lot.I got it back when I was looking for diversification as well as some decent Div / growth stocks . It kinda didn’t deliver on the growth part lol but it’s a Pharma powerhouse let’s see how this CoViD vaccine thing shakes outMost vaccines are low margin products due to delivery. Cold chain is expensive, creation is expensive, it's all just expensive.Do you think companies do things for the good of man?
Haha sorry buddy, this is capitalism.It's not even a race per se - the world is going to need far more than one company can produce, even if someone isn't first to market. Having four or five viable vaccines by end of year would be amazing. More capacity, more options. And we'd need every single dose and then some. 

Some may be more effective, safer, or be easier to produce.Can’t anybody just say that they’re optimistic about a vaccine by the end of the year and then get $1.95 billion from the government?2B for 100 million doses... There are 330+ million people in the U.S.I’ve seen like people that volunteered to get tested but I’ve never seen the results of those. Do those people just die and they just try to cover that up or what?Also [Novavax](https://grufity.com/dashboards/1594793452245/Who-will-develop-the-first-coronavirus-vaccine). Got $1.6 billion fundingWhat??? That’s insane!

“people wanting to know why things directly related to them happen is what’s wrong with society.”This is a comment section for people to communicate on a social media website, wtf us wrong with you? 

Think you’re better because the only way you contribute to any of the Internet is by talking shit on a stranger on social media?If it works like normal vaccines the bad outcome is likely it just won't be effective. If it's manufactured very wrong and QA never catches it then maybe you get sick. Any negative effects are likely to pop-up early unless the vaccine works differently then all the other ones we regularly use.Yep. Every time I see a pattern, it changes.I don't trust any of these companies trying to be first to market for the most important product of the world.There’s never been a vaccine for a corona virus.I work in the medical field, you’re correct. Like the influenza strains, the coronavirus strains like to mutate as well.drop your pants then nerdI was looking at Moderna too, if Im not mistaken they have 0 released products so far. I might be mixing them up with Inovio though.I was not aware that Pfizer had received a "bailout", per se; source? Nor are they an insurance company, though they certainly could be accused of benefitting from high insurance rates indirectly. And in many cases it is "corporate profits" that FUND those high insurance premiums for their employees; I dare say PFE pays their share. I wouldn't categorize receiving twenty bucks a shot for a vaccine that doubtless absorbed hundreds of millions (perhaps more) in R&D and clinical trials costs as corporate welfare; they are merely being paid for their wares.Have you seen the recent updates on PR’s power infrastructure rebuild?

Them getting the contract is the end of the project.So much of this.😂You the man.I’m prepared to sell at either point, but I’m selfish so I’d like to actualize my earnings sooner than later ;)😂Bahahaha pigs get fed. HODLERS get slaughtered...perpetually.Yup. Too many people are too unwilling to take profits.Hold on for dear lifeHODL - Hold Onto Da LOOTHold On for Dear Life lol many meaningsHord Orn fer Der Lerf!But why does the SEC allow it.   Any other non-pandemic time in our lives in anything outside of vaccines this would have never been able to flyhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3335060/

Because the original SARS vaccine developments were full of setbacks, roadblocks, and disappointment. Same with MERS which still happens annually. Both viruses are close cousins of covid.

I'm actually expecting many years before a vaccine is developed, but I hope I'm wrong.It’s because there is uncertainty. In the medical community it’s frowned upon to promise something unless it’s for certain. I believe there will be a vaccine but an effective vaccine in 6 months? Not sure.any biotech in phase 3 trials you would never have a CEO come out and say what percentage they are certain of advancement.   Typically the SEC would get involved but in this case you know Trump has fired everyone.Yacht international waters bye Felicia[deleted]> I place my faith in the medical experts to put out a product that is safe when it is ready

yes, but there is a difference between a vaccine that has years of data and human experience, and something that is, for lack of better word, "rushed".

i am not denying the very obvious benefits of vaccines, but there are, and should be, concerns over a new vaccine.  whether the risks (real or perceived) outweigh the benefits or not is something else, since we dont know the risks, especially long term.

besides, there are many medical treatments that were "safe when (the product) was ready".  this isnt an easy situation to gauge the risk.

i am not an anti-vaxxer, but i also dont pretend that there arent valid concerns in this particular case.> place my faith in the medical experts to put out a product that is safe when it is ready, not Karens and Chads on the internet fear mongering science.

But surely you would understand why many reasonable, fair-minded, and educated people may not have the same degree of blind faith here, for precisely the reasons you mention: this is a highly unusual situation where corners are more likely to be cut, subjective judgments are more likely be skewed due to optimism bias and perceived necessity, and the sheer speed at which testing and development has been accelerated.  Blindly trusting the end result of the pharmaceutical development process, without skepticism, is no better than blindly doubting it.You claim to be a biologist but you have not seen the movie Jurassic Park obviously and you should know above all else Life will find a way.>Jumping in here as a biologist working for Umbrella Corp. ...

FTFYWell, safe except for turning you into a vampire anyway.And for what it's worth, I don't think vaccine is the right term for cancer since it's cell mutation...Vaccines are not safe. Our future president Yezus had a twitter vision this week and has proof that vaccines are the mark of the Devil. 

I am going to YOLO my life savings on NapsterA big part of the reason they are "typically extremely safe" is that development and testing is typically so arduous.  Surely you recognize the concerns about COVID vaccines being rushed through these phases to production and utilization in a matter of months?But actually the Pfizer vaccine is pretty similar to a virus in how it works. Not that it's unsafe but just saying.How would a vaccine become lethal after a year? Or dangerous in any way?Turn into vampires.

Source: see above.They hardly move so you can just farm covered calls and sell puts over a very long timeframe.All r big companies. 
UAL had  bad earning, AMTD good profit. Did not impact their stock prices.Well good thing you just got 5% of growth today :)>Having four or five viable vaccines by end of year

combined with

>Some may be more effective, safer, or be easier to produce.

scares me. A lot. I’m completely against the antivax crowd, but if we have four or five *different* vaccines in mass production within a year of the discovery of a novel virus, I’m not touching it. That likely means we’re shooting from the hip and calling any bullets that went generally downrange “accurate”, e.g. who the fuck knows the long-term impacts of it.The other companies got money from the government up front, before they started trials. Pfizer opted to fund their own effort because they thought it would be faster.There are more public libraries than Starbucks in the U.S. – a total of 16,568, including branches. Nearly 100% of public libraries provide Wi-Fi and have no-fee access to computers. Are you bullish on public libraries? Of course not, because they are provided as a public service, with no profit in mind. Like the COVID-19 vaccine.We've also committed to [buying 300MM doses of the Oxford vaccine](https://bgr.com/2020/05/21/coronavirus-vaccine-us-secures-oxford-astrazeneca-covid-19-drug-supply/).Upvotes/downvotes have ZERO real value. So getting mad about them is silly and childish.So no chance of zombie outbreak?Same here bud.. same hereThe government won't be making sodas, neither will any non-profit organization. Only soda companies can make soda.

I hope you understand my analogy.So who should be. Herbalife? The Trump administration? Dr. Oz? Chiropractors of America association? Or companies who have over a century of experience in conducting human trials to prove efficacy and safety.I work in a very related scientific field. Coronavirus's mutate far slower than the influenza virus. Everything mutates but some things have machinery to help them mutate faster. Influenzas machinery is much much faster then any known coronavirus. The only real way I could see the coronavirus having a lasting non-vaccinatable affect is if it is not able to create a strong immune memory response. The only reason we are seeing mutations in the coronavirus is because of how widespread it is and not because of innate needs hyper mutation rate.I am not an anti vaxxer but I am a little concerned about taking a vaccine that was rushed to be produced and may not have been fully tested. When it does come out I may just wait a month or so before I take it.Lol.   Nerds! Nerds! Nerds! Nerds!HODORPretty sure it's a typo that stuck, don't think it stands for anything.Aren't wild claims ok as long as they're outside trading hours?Yeah there is risk of getting a hyperactive immune response post immunization but that will come out in p3 trials. And just a note these are all in mice from that paper not humans or a any other animal model. If you look at modernas publication with monkeys they do not have this effect from their vaccine upon reintroduction.Usually I’d agree but they’re cutting like..all regulations they can to get this out faster. Not saying what we get will be good (but fingers crossed) but I do expect it before end of year.

I am also totally uniformed on vaccines and do not know what I’m talking about so. Yea.We got like 3-4 mutations discovered in the last few months.I agree the effectiveness in preventing the disease over multiple years is in question, the trials will prove safety as well as short term,1-3 months, efficacy, with additional follow-ups many months and years later.They didn't say the percentage chance of advancement. they said the percentage chance that they will have enough vaccine available if it is approved. Maybe it's a nuance but it's important. The statement is about supply not efficacy.YikesIt's called an entanglement.Make sure you drop a rap song about it tooYou aren't wrong, it's safe to be skeptical, but there needs to be a level of trust in these companies. So far the Oxford trials have shown a great response with the only side affects being fever and a headache that can be managed by Tylenol. Most of these are just variations of vaccines that we already had, or were already being tested. This isn't new technology. We will be fine as long as people get them.Y'all are making some good arguments. But to what end? Are you saying you are going to refuse a free extensively (enough) tested vaccine that more likely than not is just as safe as any other we've produced?You got me. Fun fact, Jurassic Park was actually an exposé that the scientific industrial complex has still not financially recovered from.I mean sure, but we're kind of between a rock and a hard place right? We have the world on shutdown because the presence of this virus, and therefore we are trying to end this as soon as possible. We can't really have it both ways. I think that as of right now the vaccine isn't necessarily being rushed, it's going through all the necessary clinical trials. We're just now seeing the initial trial data, and further large studies are being conducted right now to make us more sure of the safety. At least in the oxford studies, they are also doing correlate of protection studies, which are typically never done, to make sure the vaccine is 100% able to protect against challenge by an actual infection without any major effects.

So I think really all that's happening is that companies are mass producing the vaccine, hoping that the trials will pay off. Which hasn't happened before, companies investing in something that hasn't been proven to work. If for whatever reason the safety trials come back as not promising, these companies are going to take huge financial hits.Because it's an mRNA vaccine? It doesn't replicate or anything which IMO is the most important trait of a virus.I initially downvoted you because I know for a fact that some dumbass will read this and think vaccines are government controlled viruses or some shit. But on second thought, we shouldnt censor intelligent conversations because idiots could misinterpret it.Is it possible for a vaccine to be lethal in any way?I'm no antivaxxer, but any medication has the risk of long term complications if not thoroughly studied.man who knows, chemical reactions going wrong some how after a year..I have no idea[removed]I respect your opinion but disagree. I think that is layperson thinking. By the time the vaccines are approved they would all have gone through three phases of human trials involving tens of thousands of people in each one. Those studies would be double blind, randomized, and controlled and conducted with all of the scientific, medical, and research experience we have to offer. I think they will be safe, and I think it’s more dangerous not knowing the long term effects of COVID.That’s a really stupid comparison.If you cant figure out the difference between a for profit publicly traded company and a government service then I dont know how to educate you.Who says I’m mad I was asking and the fact that asking makes you fly off the handle the way you are and get all agitated and need to chime in about stuff that doesn’t affect you anyway whatsoever is exactly what I think is what’s wrong with society.

So suck on that stranger I couldn’t give one fuck about.So if they try to cure the virus by putting rabid rats infected with toxoplasmosis in a blender then maybe we get a rage virus.Spurious. His point was that we're rushing the everloving fuck out of this thing, there basically are no government regulations anymore, I'll be astonished if the FDA is allowed to so much as glance at any of the results, we're imposing arbitrary deadlines by announcing it'll be ready by the end of the year (not to mention blackmailing schools into reopening in anticipation of that). Who is doing the R&D had nothing to do with his point.It may seem rushed, but they do get tested in large batches. This is called phase 3, which is barely getting started. It involves testing it on tens of thousands of subjects of diverse age and ethnicity in different countries. 

The vaccine is not ready or approved yet. It may never be if it fails phase 3 trials. This is just a preorder, if you will.Eh, the chance of catching coronavirus in public by waiting a month will almost certainly be higher than the difference between the chance of catching it from a dud vaccine vs a vaccine with an additional month of testing.I see what you did there....Hodor.It's definitely a typo that original guy kept making. He wrote the word like 10 times and kept spelling it hodlOh no, I pulled that out of my ass and got luckythey won't go through the normal trials because the administration will rush it through the process and fuck things up even worse. On the other hand, there will be people who would have unfounded doubt about the vaccine even if it's fully tried and evaluated; they'll still refuse to take it. Remember, trump is an anti-vaxxer and he helped legitimize the irrational mistrust in vaccines in general, and this won't be any different.> Yeah there is risk of getting a hyperactive immune response post immunization but that will come out in p3 trials.

The whole problem here is that it's not going to go through the typical trials process. Corners will be cut. Pay attention.Well, think about it like this—several AIDS vaccines made it this far in development (phase II / phase III) in the nineties. That was a crisis of epic proportions much like today’s coronavirus is, except it was 100% lethal at the time. How many of those do we have today?

I wish I could explain to people how clinical trials actually work, and what it not only takes for a medication to pass, but what it takes and should take for a vaccine to pass. 

How many vaccines do we have available? 

About 25. 

How many diseases are there? 

Thousands.Still got a shortage of n95 masks i call bs.There are no known vaccine for a coronavirus yet. After decades of research.It’s not just a nuance, it’s an entirely different thing.If the best that can be determined is that a vaccine is "more likely than not" safe (51%), I doubt it would be approved,  and I certainly would not knowingly take it.  If its safety purports to be demonstrated to the same degree of reasonable certainty required for all other medications, then I would absolutely consider taking it, although I would probably still have reservations due to the circumstances. It's reasonable to expect even good doctors, scientists,  and regulators to be affected by optimism bias and the perceived importance/necessity of getting something to market here. But even accepting a relatively low risk of a vaccine, the other challenge. will be that the disease itself is relatively low risk for most people who get it. So we may have trouble convincing young, healthy adults that the vaccine is worth it for them.I do not understand, could you explain?I wouldn't say that.   We've made tremendous advancements in the last 20 years.  We're about to fast track and allow stem cell treatments.I think that's debatable. Most important thing a virus can do is force the host to produce proteins abnormal. mRNA vaccine does the same thing.

Many virus based vaccines are created bye stopping the virus from reproducing. It's still a virus just one that can't reproduce. Just like mRNA vaccines. This is just semantics I have nothing against vaccines of any rational type.You could drown in it, or swallow the needle.No not really, unless you are severely immunocompromised. Or given an outrageously high dose to trigger severe immune response. But that's why they do trials.Yes, albeit rare, but https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/guillain-barre-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20362793


Also in case you're curious of other vaccine side effects https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm Most though are pretty minor.


Note def not antivax was just having a convo this morning about how're they testing for long term side effects of releases a vaccine that's only been tested for 6 mo to a yearYou guys have bought into our current society’s anti-anti-vaxxer nonsense, which is a really bad mindset to invest with.

Of course it is possible for vaccines to be lethal. Why don’t we vaccinate against dengue any more? That would be because lots of kids died when they tried it. https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/05/03/719037789/botched-vaccine-launch-has-deadly-repercussions?t=1595452356351Yes, see the original SARS vaccine efforts (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3335060/). The vaccine caused intense immune system responses which killed the hosts in some cases. We never successfully developed a vaccine for the original SARS.

It's important to conduct all safety trials and phases in their entirety. I won't be touching any vaccine until the proper protocol is followed. Vaccines are extremely safe when the method is sound and it's why all the important scientists gave that 12-18 month **minimum** timeframe early on in the pandemic.Early polio vaccines caused paralysis.  I’m not an anti vaxxer but as a healthy guy in his 20s I’d probably rather just get the virus.  I’d probably be down to get the second batch of the vaccine next year though.Yes, allergiesVaccines can do bad stuff. Thats why there is a National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program

The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, established by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (1), is a no-fault system in which persons thought to have experienced an injury or to have died as a result of administration of a covered vaccine can seek compensation. The program became operational on October 1, 1988, and is intended as an alternative to civil litigation under the traditional tort system in that negligence need not be proven. Claims arising from covered vaccines must first be adjudicated through the program before civil litigation can be pursued.

The program relies on the Vaccine Injury Table, which lists the vaccines covered by the program and the injuries (including death), disabilities, illnesses, and conditions for which compensation might be awarded. The table defines the time during which the first symptom or substantial aggravation of an injury must appear after vaccination to be eligible. Successful claimants receive a legal presumption of causation if a condition listed in the table is proven, thus avoiding the need to prove actual causation in an individual case. Claimants also can prevail for conditions not listed in the reportable events table if they prove causation for covered vaccines.Vaccines aren't really medications in the sense of acting like drugs. They just train your immune system in a controlled way, using the same mechanism as a natural infection, but doing it way safer. 

I'm not saying to not safely test things, but just want to tell you vaccines have very distinct mechanisms of action that are not the same as drugs, and so you can't really equate them. Any potential side effects of a vaccine happen very acutely, theres no real chronic problems that come.I wasn't trying to be snark, so sorry if it came off that way. But just so you know, a vaccine typically only acts directly on your body for ~2 weeks. After that, your body's internal immune system is what protects you for decades. Vaccines just 'teach' your immune system how to see the virus, and the actual components of the vaccine are probably degraded in a matter of days.Well you explain to me how it would work then lmao. No seriously, I want you to explain to me how a vaccine works, and then how the other statement makes any senseSure, I totally get where you’re coming from (and thanks for not being an asshole). My main worry is that most Phase 3 Trials take anywhere from one to three years, to make sure we have a decent grasp on the medium term effects. If we go on our current covid schedule, we’re hoping to get the same results from 5 months (for Moderna - July > November). 

You can blind and randomize all you want, but I don’t think there are many ways to accelerate a populace’s physiological reaction to a vaccine to test for long term side effects in a short timeframe. Would be happy to be proven wrong thoughHere’s a better comparison. Pfizer’s top selling drug is the pneumococcal vaccine Prevnar-13 which goes for $250/dose. Their contract for the COVID vaccine is $20/dose.You should explain your position as opposed to hurling insults; it helps everyone involved: commenters and readers.Analysts were [projecting](https://www.fiercepharma.com/vaccines/analysts-see-5-billion-potential-for-moderna-covid-19-vaccine) a minimum of $2B in sales for Moderna in 2021, at $50/dose. But Pfizer just locked in at $20/dose. So much for that.You’re right I definitely flew off the handle 🥴. I just get tired of people complaining about being downvoted as if it will be put on your credit report. Welcome to social media where people you don’t know chime in. 

Also why am I getting downvoted!!!Ok so you’re telling me there’s a chance. That’s all I needed to hear. Zombie apocalypse imminent.Ok, let me know how it works out for you.Just wait until they start having babies with autism. Then the REeee ReeeE will be heard round the world.I’m asking just because I seriously don’t know, not challenging you but can you create a vaccine for a blood transmitted...whatever classification AIDs would fall into. 

I think what I’m asking is, is it even possible to create vaccines for somethings or depending on what they do nobody would even attempt?I was just joking. Using hyperbole to exaggerate how some people view science is run like some evil corporationExcept for some cars in the street I could literally walk by hospitals in my area and I wouldn’t be able to tell if it was 1970 or 2020The Merck vaccine is an mRNA just encoding for the spike protein alone. It's not the whole viral genome which would include any VP's that interfere with immune activation, or would include it's replication materials. 

Don't know enough about the virus to know whether there are subgenomic expression of other things from this transcript though.They're both pretty important, I'll give you that. It does do a lot of what viruses do. I guess there's a difference in what someone who doesn't really understand how viruses work would think is similar and what a virologist would think is similar.I had a friend who got vaccinated for the flu and the week after he was found gunned down in an alleyThat gave me a good chuckle, thanks.This vaccine is based on mRNA which is just bits of messages telling your cells to make the antigen that then causes your body to gain immunity. It's not from a virus or ever been any virus.so the only thing that being immunocompromised would do is make the vaccine less effective.Shouldn't trials take a while for the vaccine to be proven to work? As far as I know the quickest vaccine ever made took a few years to develop. If the covid 19 vaccine only takes a few months to develop, will it work as effectively for a large populace.Sorry, but that’s absolute bullshit. There are plenty of vaccine candidates that we never made mainstream because they do more harm than good. It’s some modern myth/propaganda that vaccines are completely safe. Look up the product information for any currently used vaccine and you’ll see a variable bunch of bad or even lethal side effects. Anaphylaxis, encephalitis, GBS, etc

We use vaccines because the risk/benefit equation is favourable for a particular agent, not because they are somehow magical perfect drugs.

Reddit does this weird thing where they mock anti-vaxxer karens for getting the science wrong, while also getting the science very wrong themselves.Thanks for the info it's really appreciatedI'm not going to strip anything away from this except just clarify two things: 

This was a study in mice not humans. Also in skimming through the paper none of the mice actually die from the experiment?

This was a study where they vaccinated and then subsequently infected the mice with the virus, not just the vaccine itself.

It's usually not done because it's not thought to be ethical to try in humans, but I think that I've read that they are going to be doing correlates of immunity studies, to show that challenge of the virus to vaccinated individuals is safe for SARS-CoV2. So the risks highlighted in this study should be assessed in the trials of this vaccine.I was going to raise the polio vaccine as well. 

It's best we don't rush out a not thoroughly tested vaccine to the public, and risk some devastating side effects get discovered after the fact like Polio vaccine. 

If you think anti-vaxxers are bad and dangerous now just think about how much worse they'd get if they could point to a modern day polio vaccine mess that could have been avoided by not rushing to get any vaccine out.The reason the vaccine caused paralysis is because there was a batch which ineffectively inactivated the virus. Basically, these unfortunate individuals received a dosage of the actual virus, which causes paralysis... A testament to the screening technology of the 1950s.

You may be surprised that vaccine safety efficacy has improved over the last 70 years. Also, with the new vaccine tech used for SARS-CoV2 there is 0 chance that you actually get infected with the virus.100% agreed.  I'm in the same boat as you.  What if 20/30 years from now people are saying the same thing about the "early COVID vaccines".That’s not true. Vaccines have a wide range of potential side effects, not all of which are acute. Anaphylaxis is a good example of a vaccine side effect that can kill you quickly. But see that dengue vaccine for an example of a rushed product that can cause long-term serious problems.[removed]I don’t have have a position, I’m pointing out the absurdity of his comparison.At least we can both agree that society sucks.Jesus, imagine how much fucking ammo that would give the anti-vax crowdLet’s just say we haven’t found a way to create a vaccine for many things. Whether or not it’s impossible stands to be seen. 

Retroviruses (like AIDS) are extremely hard to tackle, because the virus hides within the cell. 

Coronaviruses haven’t been easy to tackle either, and to date we don’t have a vaccine for a coronavirus or a medication that specifically targets any of them. We are shooting from the hips here—trying anything that works. That’s why we keep getting these “oh, oh, I found something” and then two weeks later it’s “nevermind”. 

I’m hesitant to say we won’t be able to make a vaccine—but I think it’s infinitely more difficult and less likely than people’s automatic assumption that just because we have thousands of people working on it we will have something to show for it in 18 months.But AIDS is different right? People don’t just fight it off and develop antibodies. And I thought it lives in people’s body indefinitely.OkI know. They probably have more than the protein alone to help it be brought into the cell, be stabilized, some sort of adjuvant, etc but it's not the whole virus. Basically I am just saying viruses do two things: force the host to produce encoded proteins and replicate its own genetics. An mRNA vaccine and a non-replicating viral vaccine do the same thing, produce proteins and not reproduce the genetics.Yeah you're right, I didn't want to go into the weeds too much but I think being immunocompromised is only really a problem for live attenuated vaccines yeah? 

I think this new mRNA vaccine is pretty exciting btwI think it's definitely a fair point to raise, but I'll counter that we've never had the urgency to develop a vaccine as quickly as this one. And from the persepctive of someone on the 'inside' the toolbox we have as biologists in modern days is quite frankly amazing, and the development of this vaccine is a testament to that. Plus the entire scieintific community has been dedicated to this for the last almost 6 months, around the world. 

All that being said, the actual trials are the most important part of the whole process. And those are still ongoing right now, but look promising so far. This is also really the first case that biomedical companies are investing in production of huge amojujnts of a vaccine before it is proven effective, because we need it so fast. If it proves to not be good, they'll be at millions in losses, but they're doing it to try and help people I guess. 

All that being said, even though I'm a scientist, I agree that our pharmaceutical industry sucks in America and has a bad reputationSerious side effects of vaccines are extremely rare, which is why I feel comfortable with calling them safe. And I fully support that vaccine efficacy studies include any negative effects seen in the patients, even when they are likely not related to the vaccine itself. 

And safety trials are being done on the SARS-CoV2 vaccine, it's not being put onto shelves until that's been done. Obviously there will need to be follow up longitudinal studies, but it's not like we can just all of the sudden decide to not vaccinate people to prevent a deadly diseaseI think the "vaxxer"/"anti-vaxxer" dichotomy is unhelpful in this context.  Pretty much everyone agrees vaccines have risks and benefits.  The issue is that, in the past, "anti-vaxxers" have tended to unjustifiably overestimate the supposed risks (autism, etc.) of particular vaccines, despite rigorous testing, and perhaps to underestimate their benefits (pointing to the fact that vaccines are not always 100% effective).  In this case, however, there will be legitimate questions about the safety and efficacy of vaccines rushed through development and testing in record time.  Particularly for novel types of vaccines (like mRNA, for instance --  [https://www.phgfoundation.org/briefing/rna-vaccines](https://www.phgfoundation.org/briefing/rna-vaccines) ).I get it but at this point it seems much lower risk to just get the virus at my age group as someone without any comorbidities.Anaphylaxis occurs at a rate of ~ 0.00000131087% in terms of vaccine outcomes. [Source 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4783279/) 

And yes I was speaking generally. The Dengue vaccine is one that can cause problems, but it is only approved in several countries and is not routinely administered which is why I typically don't feel the need to talk about it. You would need to discuss with your Dr. about receiving the Dengue vaccine. But to say it was rushed is not true, the dengue vaccine was worked on for 20 years and still had unforseen problems when it was released. So it was more of an example of an understanding of the immunology, not that it was rushed.

Please just whatever you do in the future, don't be proud of being ignorantwhy don't you actually tell us why though?[deleted]It's called a self fulfilling prophecy.

Or a correlation without a causation.Interesting for sure. I appreciate the reply.Not too many advancesYupI guess technology can speed up the process more than ever before. The problem I have is how this may get politicised. If a country like china develops the vaccine first, it will probably not be trusted and not used by many. Some people really dont trust vaccines in the first place and, with a president like trump, many Americans may not take the vaccine at all, which will undermine the effectiveness of it.Serious side effects are rare in the vaccines that we use, because we wouldn’t use them if they weren’t (because the absolute benefit to the pt is also less than most realise e.g. IPV = effectively zero benefit).

But there’s nothing intrinsically magical or safe about vaccine candidates. Dengue is just the one that sprang to mind, but in post countries OPV is more likely to give you polio than prevent it. Fluvax pulled a couple of years back due to,seizures.  Etc, etcI was using it as an example to counter the false claim that all vaccine related side effects are acute. Yes, the problems were unforseen - the same as every other drug pulled from the market. 
There are good vaccines and there are bad vaccines. We have no,idea how safe a covid vaccine will be, but the idea that all vaccines are somehow harmless is patently wrong.I’m not going to hold your hand.  Its not hard to find the mountains of evidence proving they are not all safe.  I’ve have personally seen countless kids lives ruined from them.You read my history and think you gleaned something from it.  You’re an actual useful idiot.That's a pretty obtuse view on the worldOh yeah I agree, it's really sad how political this whole thing has become. As if vaccines hadn't become 'controversial' enough already in the last few years. I see survey results that up to 20% of people will refuse a vaccine and it terrifies me.I trust vaccines. Period. But I am very wary about a rushed vaccine. It’s like not wanting to buy the newest straight from the factory game console day 1 because of the inevitable bugs that need patching. Does that make sense?Curious, what vaccines are you talking about? I understand getting ill after a shot for a day or two but their lives ruined? I’m confused. Unless they are somehow the anomaly of vaccines (extremely rare to be affected critically by a vaccine) I highly doubt that is the case.could you please just hold my handMost doctors offices look very similar to how they were when I was a kiddoTbh, I feel like a few more than that are going to refuse to vaccinate. Many people are on edge. If you thought the first half of the year was tough, this fall is gonna be ridiculous.>Everybody is a genius in a bull market

So many people in this sub would do well to take that to heart.Didn’t Mark make his fortune in the dot com bubble?There are defintely some similarities, but as Cuban notes, the Fed is taking some pretty extreme steps to pump in liquidity. If you talk to ten different market experts they will give you ten different ways this all might end, but the theory I like is that the party wont end until the Fed raises rates, and they won't raise rates until we see a spike in inflation. So the real question is when do we see inflation? 

At the end of the day Mark is right, asset prices are frothy and you shouldnt put more in the market right now then you can stomach to lose. However, I think you could also be missing out on a lot of market gains if you have no exposue as the surge from March lows has already proven.You are smart if you kept buying in March and didn't panic sell during the circuit breakersHalf the people on this subreddit think they are the second coming of Warren Buffet.So what am I supposed to do as a 27 year old?

He is not just sitting completely on the sidelines. He has said he keeps a lot of cash to have opportunities to put it into play when they arise. 

His sentiment I believe is more about the actions taking place. People are buying companies without regard for the risk right now. A lot of people will likely get burned. People buying companies filing for bankruptcy, every spac that has an acquisition targeted, tons of options, and this is happening probably at an unprecedented level with everyone having easy access to trading with no fees during a quarantine.I am with Cuban.  And it is only partially the insane valuations and tech stocks selling at 6-10 times sales with no earnings but mainly the number of young kids that are playing options on margin and day trading on margin with their $600/week unemployment checks that signal to me that we are near a blow off top.   Here is a quote from Scott McNeely the founder and long time CEO of one of the Dot Com bubbles top stocks, Sun Microsystems.

Scott McNeely was the CEO of Sun Microsystems, one of the darlings of that bubble. At its peak his stock hit valuation of ten-times revenues. A couple of years afterward he had this to say about that time (via [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2002-03-31/a-talk-with-scott-mcnealy)):

&#x200B;

>At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?

Take a look at it.  I had a client that was one of Scott's key execs that owned a million shares of Sun and sold all million shares at $60/share.   And he would not let his financial advisor invest it in anything for about 5 years.   So it simply sat in cash.  He said, "once you have won the game there is no need to compete any longer."Until the FED is relieved of it's authority to directly purchase assets there is no such thing as a bubble.  This is just the stock market now.  It's a government run retirement fund. It's not allowed to drop.I feel like there's an inevitable downturn coming with the election season (regardless of who wins), and I'm very wary about how far the market may fall and if it may trigger a snowball affect with all the other crap going on in the worldBuy the dip???This is a pretty good piece on why it's hard to be anything but long with what the fed is currently doing. I get Cube's point, but you either join this type of intervention, or have your money devalued. 

https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2020/07/16/did-the-market-actually-recover-from-covid-19/This guy has been screaming the sky is falling for almost 10 years.  According to Cuban the market is always overpriced and about to crash.  I saw an interview he gave maybe 6-7 years ago saying the same thing and I actually considered reallocating some of my money at the time.  I’m glad I didn’t listen to himSomeone help me understand. Why would the market not react to the economy for years? If so this truly is a rigged market. Even the banks are saying the worst is yet to come. I don't see how this disconnect can go on much long. Or we will have 10%-15% unemployment with the market at all time highs?👆this guy is trying to short. I guarantee it.Bubble or not, the fed won't let us crash too far againHe's right in a sense. This earnings season will set the tone for the next leg of the market. If tech continues to make money and exceed expectations, we'll see another leg upward. If tech disappoints, we have plenty of room to drop.Hey did you know we could be in a bubble? Bubble guys! Theres a bubble! Watch out for the bubble! This bubble is similar to other bubbles but also a completely different bubble!

These articles are relentlessI personally think that we are ok until the Fed starts raising rates which won't happen for a few years. Until then, there is a lot of money to be made in the market right now.

Once the Fed starts raising rates in a few years, that is when I will start getting very cautious. Until then, don't fight the Fed and don't fight the tape.Stop losses my friends. Let it ride and hope your stop losses activate if it does all come crashing down.This advice is lame. He should give alternatives and tell why it’s a bubble.I cashed out my entire portfolio back in March.  I’ve been feeling like a complete fool, and every day I’m tempted to buy back into my positions.  But I’m trying to be patient and wait this thing out because I know as soon as I buy back in it will all come tumbling down.Fun fact: Mark Cuban made his billions FROM the dot-com bubble, by selling broadcast.com to Yahoo.  He was certainly greedy.Time to let someone else succeed this time eh big fella!I pulled out 60% of personal investments today, with the remainder setup with stop losses with risk im willing to accept.  401k can stay since this bump in the road won't matter for that.

I have more than made up any Feb/March losses and have come out FAR better than I was coming into 2020. 

I plan to stay out until after the election.It’s about timing he sold his company for 900 million that was worthless after the bubble burst.The market was already in a bubble before Covid. If the Covid did not crash it, I don't know what will....Top is in!We all know we're in a bubble, but I mean what the f\*ck can we do about it.

Sit cash while inflation eats it away?

Short the rally?

Buy real estate? Gold, silver? Oh wait, those are also in a bubble right now.My guess is that we will start to see a slow decline in stock prices over a long period of time.Holding long term so bullish for me!I guess he wants to buy the dips."buy live nation "Pigs get fat hogs get slaughtered, sounds like a sign. All in on Harley 8/21p $23's...A stop loss is all you need to survive when things go south. I'm not even concerned about it because of my stop losses. I just move them up a little bit every day.Foolish to compare to the dotcom bubble. Today we have lots of tech companies with real business models and quickly growing revenue streams. The dotcom was pure hype, based on dreams, fantasies and unusable tech.Honestly this is nothing like the dotcom bubble.     Take Google for example. Last three years we have 18%, 23% and 23% top line growth while making over $30 billion.

https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/net-income

There was NO dotcom companies that had anything like this in results.    Plus the big tech companies have barely even got started.   Things like this are the future.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6lIhMRe6wQGet lost Cuban we new wealth nowNaw. It’s going to be like 1929. However, I have no fucking clue when it will happen so I’m net long.

Rules of economics will eventually turned back on. I just have no fucking clue when or howFck you Cuban, just wait until I buy the Houston Rockets with my tendies #StockOnlyGoUpMy friends at the fed will do their job to make sure the market is up. They will buy every single stocks if they have to make sure the market stays up.Pretty sure he had most of his had position in Amazon recently.Greederz gonna greed thoI mean, if you even listen to like a single investor podcast, you could have this much information. If you are getting investment advice from Mark Cuban, you are weeks behind because that guy just gets advice from people who do the actual research. I've known about the impending collapse for months and have prepared my portfolio accordingly. Everything that is super high risk for me has had a trailing stop loss for like 2 months.This guy couldn’t be wronger. We’re going higher!Index investors: Indexes are way higher now than they were even at the top of the 90s bubble lmfao nerd bullFor once I agree with him.“Why’d got pull out so eArLy”. Profits are profits my man.There are some stocks still at deep discounts, those are the ones I am invested in, well, and Tesla.Bought like hell in March yeetAnyone else having a hard time holding positions overnight? The uncertainty/volatility makes me hesitant to keep anything longer than a day tradeMark Cuban has a loud mouth and is more of a celebrity than an investor. I would love to see his own independent analysis behind his claims. Claims such as the market crashing after Trump's election in 2016, on which he was completely wrong.Dot com bubble were companies with crazy Evaluations and little to no revenue. These tech companies have revenue at leastThe big joke is that the last bubble is never like the next bubble50% cash baby.  Let it crash.I've literally been trading a few months but can everyone shut the fuck up about the fucking dot-com bubble.

It's literally used more than the word "the" and about as useful when it comes to predicting the stock market.Watch QQQ continue this trend for the next few years. I don't trust Mark Cuban for my stock advice, thank you. This tech boom is nothing like the tech bubble in any way.A billionaire telling people not to be greedy...This is the same guy who predicted stocks would crash the day after the 2016 election..Says the guy trying to throw you off his tail. Biggest opportunist outside of Bill Gates.He also is quoted saying “remember that bubble lasted years!”  an he was basically saying everything is just going to keep going up but so will the risk"Buy and hold is the best strategy for the long term" and "dont be greedy" are two completely different mindsets. I sold off a portfolio at the end of last month holding mostly Faang and tesla other stocks of that sort. Sold cause I was up massively but also hit my goal for that portfolio and sold out to buy a Tesla. But that portfolio would've easily been worth 30% more todayi inversed this dude back in March and I made gains. I am inversing him again today.Cuban's right...the most interesting thing to me is that if you look at 6m-1y charts, the v-shaped recovery more or less returns stocks to those pre-existing trends. This made many options gamblers feel invincible, because in a normal market, IV is overstated. But in a v-shaped recovery, IV was severely understated. Plus we have the added effect of the fed stimulating the market with economic stimulus, because let's be honest, most people don't need the money, they're throwing it in robinhood or buying sneakers on eBay. It's a really crazy time. To me the fed should have let the economy correct itself...but now we're in for inflation - esp suburban housing. It's hard to predict what's going to happen, but you'd be smart to set some tight stop losses to protect some of these meaty gains. I lucked out having my portfolio heavily weighted with amazon and tesla. Crazy to believe because in March I thought my future was toast, and here we are 4 mths later and I'm just lucky I stayed invested...sold the REITs, and doubled down on the other stuff.My roommate thinks she's going to get rich playing penny stocks. He thinks it's a better option than value investing. He literally started trading two weeks ago and he's been making money. He put in 3000 and he's up 7000, but I keep trying to tell him that we're in a bull market and it will end. He doesn't seem to get it. He literally knows nothing. Doesn't know technical analysis, and he's a "day-trader"  he doesn't know what earnings per share are or what any of the numbers mean. He said divdened stocks are dumb. Sold all his shares in DOL.TO and started buying stuff like IBO, CLSN, TXNP, JE and dumb shit like that.  He just sets limit orders at a price and sell limit orders in the hopes he gets it. He gets all his information from paid pumpers on YouTube  and some site called finvidz. Worst part of it all, he got his 67 year old mom into it. 

Tl:dr roomate thinks he is an expert day Trader after two weeks, doesn't know technical analysis.To be fairI feel like this is the most anticipated market crash EVAR!   Also.  That’s EXACTLY what I said during the dot com crash.  Analysts were blaring over every kind of media that PE ratios were untenable.  Valuations were ludicrous.   
The moral of the story is this:  big players are ready to bail and when they do, it could be a bloodbath.It's very odd.  Right now, it's like why buy anything but tech stocks?  Tech stocks only go up and non-tech stocks are mostly flat or down.

However, this too shall pass.  But when and how, who knows?

Inflation will sustain stocks. Its hard for me to sctually have a long-term bearish outlook on stocks. The only thing that would actually change this course we're on of inflating asset prices would be drastic change to fiscal policy in our government. A return to a gold pegged dollar which will never happenyou left out that the dot com bubble lasted 5 years and he states this as well. "Need to be patient when it's riding up, it can go higher"Good Times only teach bad lessons.

I'm also pretty worried about the stock market rnSell when others are greedy. Buy when others are fearful.It's similar in the sense that everyone and their brother are now talking about stocks and beginning to trade. Part of that is the ease of access now with Robinhood and other brokers offering no minimums, free trades and fractional shares. 


It's not similar because a lot of these tech companies are making boatloads of money and there is a lot of liquidity/low rates. Rates were rising in the late 1990s/early 2000s which contributed to the pop of the bubble.>"In some respects"

More like "In all respects".  There was other stuff to invest in, back in the 1990s.  It's just that dot-com mania was taking attention away from it.

Today, there's literally nothing.  What are you going to do, start a business?  Join a private lending pool?  Buy bonds?  Lol.Stupid bears gonna be stupid bears, for them every year is a dot com bubble year, fuck em, let them hoard useless fiat forever.“Be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy.”

We all know which one is the case right now.He is not a stock investor. There are always good opportunities to buy stocks. Watch this! [Large cap stocks ](https://youtu.be/b50k46U5tDA) and this! [Best performing stocks ](https://youtu.be/BOsxgKk2tXY)What a phagI do not listen to Mark Cuban.  Got lucky with his company and then bought a sports team.  That's about itThis is worst then the dot com bubble 


https://youtu.be/ZzFyBuJYSJUDon’t get greedy said the billionaire to the non billionaires.he's just saying that so he can buy teh dipThis bubble won’t burst until the fed stops the QE. Mark is a cool dude to acknowledge what’s going on. But the largest investing firms own more assets than the entire GDP of the US. 

If it hasn’t already, their assets will double our GDP, and triple and so on. Until as a country everyone votes to change the system. Unfortunately anyone whose 40+ NEEDS the market to not crash so they can retire. They aren’t going to pop this bubble. 

Fuck you boomers (jk but not really)Imagine taking stock market advice from Mark CubanHe said this about the NFL several years ago but the NFL has done nothing but become more dominant since then. I think that this is just something he likes to sayHe's only saying that so he can  profit more 😂, fuk this guy and his advise.When it crashes imma buy nflx, great company to own, divis for years to come... just over valued as FuckHe is not an investor like Warren Buffett. Here are a few good stocks as examples. Watch this! [Best performing stocks ](https://youtu.be/BOsxgKk2tXY)So in other words this shit will keep rising !!!!!Shut up nerdIt looks like certain group of people are trying very hard to crash the market before the election.Mark Cuban is a gay bear period 🐻 🌈This guy needs to shut up“Pigs get fed, hogs get butchered”I actually think one should be greedy now when the bubble is just getting started. This is where most of the profits are being made

The trick is to sell right before it pops, and one can easily time that moment with all the data we have available these daysThere are still plenty of people honestly using Warren Buffet as negative example or just starightout bullshitting him.            
       
A bunch of newbie wankersI know I ain't a genius, I'm just ridin' the wave my guyI just left my funds alone and didn't invest any of my cash, so what kind of genius does that make me?  I'm feeling pretty awful about not "riding the wave".  Most of the stocks I thought about buying back in March have all gone up, some 1,000% (much higher than their 52-wk highs).  Sure, my funds are almost back to where they were before March but had I played the stocks I wanted to, I would have tripled or more the value of my main fund.

I was bullish but acted bearish and now I kick myself for it.  It would have had a huge effect on my life and security.

There were a few ways I was thinking of going:

1. Buy solid large companies that are basically guaranteed to recover (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, SHOP) or just QQQ fund.
2. Buy the top 3 cruise lines at the bottom and sell no longer than a week later and take the money to put into the next trade. By then, I had Wayfair and Overstock on my watchlist and was thinking of getting into both. Analysts scared me away from W and I didn't know enough about OSTK, which had a rough several months.  Of course, W goes up 400% and OSTK goes up 1,000% from the day I would have gotten in.
3. Join Stocktwits and FOMO until I'm down to $0 or up by $1 million.  What a pumper shit show this was.

I didn't do any of them, instead, I just started learning about day trading, swing trading, how to do due diligence, how to scan for promising stocks, how to read the news, etc.  I developed a Python script to filter all the news and show me only what I want.  I started reading several books, most written many years ago but still applied.  I started watching good traders on YouTube and learning how to read charts and use indicators.  I opened some accounts with various brokers so I can test their platforms and discovered that most sucks.  I now mostly use Thinkorswim and Webull.  

I have been paper trading.  I find pretty good companies, but I sometimes get in too late or sell too soon.  Learning many lessons from that.  I find companies on news before they rocket, but I rarely invested in those because I didn't think the news was a big deal.  I later learned that these penny stocks with low floats react to the news differently, even if the news is not a "big deal".  Some people on Stocktwits do make good calls, but they also make bad calls, so you have to do your own research (they'll only show you screenshots about their good calls later).  Fundamentals have been thrown out the window with these speculative momentum trades, which I didn't think existed.

My picks for yesterday were VCNX, CAPR, AIKI, ONTX, SONM, CCX, NIO, AYRO, ACRX.  All did great instead of ACRX.  However, it all depended on when you go in and out.  As someone with a day job, that would have been tough to keep an eye on.Really? I feel like all this sub does is whine about the market not going down. Or maybe that’s r/investingHonestly this sub is better then most.He said same thing 2 months agoYep just reading down this thread alone shows where there herd mentality is. When everyone thinks one thing will happen usually the outcome is the opposite.Yes! I knew I was a genius

/s@ the MUSKeteers/Tesla mobWhat about the people that are still dumb in a bull market? Asking for a friend...i must be stupid then :)But... but... but... they are geniuses!  They know what they are doing!This market is the greatest dead cat bounce of all time.Yes, but he pulled out before it all came crashing down. People called him nuts for selling while equities were flying. That's why he is echoing "Dont be greedy".He sold a shitty internet radio company completely obsolete nowNo idea if it's due to inflation but it sure seems like meat is getting expensive quickly where I live (midwest). My Costco even had to put up a sign assuring people that their profit margins haven't changed on those products.The fed is definitely a factor. But why is no one mentioning that people are accumulating money from not being able to go out to eat, drink, party, vacation, etc. And are just dumping that money into what looks like a massive bull run? Not to mention they're also spending that money on purchases, which makes some businesses more profitable.> So the real question is when do we see inflation?

The right question is:

1) Is the way we measure inflation even accurate?

2) Would it be a drama if prices started falling because quantities of stuff produced and purchased would also increase?I’m pretty inexperienced but yeah it does seem like inflation will be the pin that pricks the bubble. I’ve been watching the Fed Observer on youtube and his [thesis](https://youtu.be/SiKGnkbZ0KI) is the same. The one question I haven’t been able to figure out; how does one track inflation?Obviously this is anecdotal but grocery and lumber prices are going up quickly where I live in US.Inflation may be a risk but it also may not happen. What I'm worried about is solid good news, not hope. Good news is bad news which means market will eventually anticipate monetary policy tightening.What do you mean by "stomach to lose"? Don't you know stonks only go up?

But on a serious note, I agree with you when it comes to short-term investments. I'm a long-term investor, and I'm just taking this as an opportunity to buy some lower priced stocks. I'm also using the DCA strategy, so hopefully I catch this upcoming downturn too.I know everything is very uncertain right now, but half the people say put your money in equities, gold, etc to avoid inflation to your cash and then the other half are saying what you alluded to, don't put more into equities than you can stomach losing. But IMO as long as your not in options and you picked stocks you believe in you should be fine sitting on them through a recession (assuming you are a long-term investor). With that said, I am trying to cash out some of my gains (especially on non blue chip type stocks) so that I have a little cash on hand in the event the market does come crashing down. I also set up a ton of stop losses so that if that crash comes I can scoop right back up at a lower cost basis.> party wont end until the Fed raises rates, and they won't raise rates until we see a spike in inflation.

bingoYeah I wouldn’t buy any tech stocks rn. ETF’s tho I will and save up cash to get ready to lump sum in wonderful companies at wonderful prices.*than you canKeeping 70% of my available funds as cash on hand in a low interest account. I am currently only investing in stocks that I am very long on (amzn, spy, Google, etc.)I bought a bunch of stocks in March and I didn't sell anything. I feel a little smart but a lot of lucky that the shit didn't keep hitting the fan.I was too scared to put my cash in during March (huge sigh) but I did increase my contributions to my 401K during that time so hoping that pays off at retirement!Ya I’m up 17% in my Roth IRA because of the drop. Too bad that money will be tax free for me in about 35 years though lmaoI started shorting then, dead cst jump they said 😂.

I'm brokeEven seeing the word "circuit breaker" now pertaining to stocks gets my blood rushing. Those few weeks were such a wild rideI wanted to buy but I was mostly throwing no money at emergency savings. I thought I was going to lose my job. Thankfully I didn't, but I only got a modest amountI did this. Only I bought small cap value so I didn’t get anythingIt's what got me into investing to be honest. Thought "oh pandemic, everything's down, good time to start investing"

Had 200 bucks now I got 1200 haha. If only its gonna be so easy from now on...Wtf else would I be here for if I didn’t think I’m the second coming of Warren BuffetSame half that think dividends are for boomers I bet.shit half the people on here wanna be the next wolf of wall street, one person I know irl, said he’s gonna be the next wolf, hella fuckin cringe.The "Oracles of the Ozarks."Are u kidding? We redditor already surpass warren buffet and become the top oneLook dude. Idk if you know but the entire economy is propped up on synthetic CDOs created from a collection of subprime mortgage backed securities. They package the Bonds together to hide the risk so people that think their getting triple A rated bonds are really getting triple B subprime shit. Once the default rates go past 5% the bonds go under and 5 trillion dollars worth of toxic assets will disappear. Just read the prospectives on some of these things. The lawyers who put them together don’t even know what they did. Luckily it’s easy to take advantage of as long as you have an ISDA trading license which you can get with by meeting the 100 million dollar capital requirement or by knowing a guy. Once you get this all you gotta do is head to the banks and tell which bonds you want to write credit default swaps on. Trust me dude. Nobody knows about this shit but we’re literally on the brink of the collapse of capitalism as we know it.Buy high, sell low- Warren Buffet 2.0I’m literally Warren Buffett, God, and Elon Musk combined.It’s really not that hard. You just need extreme patience. We don’t know if value based investing is the way to go moving forwardI am not like Buffet. Buffet is waiting for the next opportunity to buy coal industries and newspapers.Just keep holding your core positions but have cash on hand to buy more if there is a crash. You can also hedge your account with treasuries like TLT, with metals like gold or silver, or by buying puts when some downward momentum starts. Don't try and nail the top with puts because the market might just keep irrationally going up for who knows how long.

You should also have a cash safety net that's outside of the market completely. I like to keep 6 months of expenses worth of cash.Don’t try and time it. Just buy and hold. Don’t panic you have time on your sideETFs. If you are long you have nothing to worry aboutIMHO.  Stay invested in stocks.  Don’t use margin.  Be ready to jump out and take a loss.  It’s hard to sell at a loss.  Consider stop loss orders.Pretty sure he’s referring to things like SHOP, NKLA, ZM, and any other EV related companyLook at ebita, their share prices are fine.How does FED print companies revenues/profits?They say this every time there's a bubble. This and "oh but it's different this time"My gut feeling is trump will do whatever it takes to prop the market up until November to give him a shot at re-election. But once November comes I think we could be seeing quite the downturn in our overall economy. People seem to not realize that impacts of major events like COVID (although unprecedented) typically happen on a lag.

People are likely burning up savings and using stimulus / unemployment to get by and as that begins to wither away more people will find themselves in positions with no savings and no job opportunities as more and more corporations and business realize that they can not continue to operate as they were before leaving less jobs available for the unemployed who already are probably struggling with no money on hand... 

Not to be too cold hearted but I'm also banking on this to happen so I can buy a house for a reasonable price... been waiting like 5 years.Seems kinda simplistic to tie stock market performance to one single factor.As long as the big players like Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Berkshire etc. are profitable and are not at risk of bankruptcy, they will hold up the indexes, no matter how bad things may seem in main street.The thinking is that because the price of a stock is set by buyers and sellers so the economy can only impact it by switching their minds about the value. My sympathy with this view is that it is technically correct but a speculative herd can spook as quickly as they became convinced that this time it's different. Value investing sets a floor that keeps stocks from falling too low. Speculation can buoy some of them way up and down above this.>we will have 10%-15% unemployment with the market at all time highs?

Unemployment and market value can logically be disconnected. I don't expect the market to react to unemployment specifically. GDP has been stagnant for decades, but I don't expect the market to react to that either. Now, corporate profits have been going up for decades (with a moving average of about 4 years) and I do expect the market to reflect that... and it does... it actually mirrors it quite well. So, as long as profits keep going up, I think we'll see the market go up regardless of what else happens.So which tech company do you expect to have such terrible earnings? Please clue us in and also show us  your puts on these companies.Banks are posting higher than ever revenues. Im sorry that you missed your chance to buy in on the lows of MarchPeople saying this don't understand what would actually motivate the fed to raise rates. Of course if it were up to them they would just keep pumping liquidity for the foreseeable future and wait years to raise rates, but if there's a spike in inflation it forces their hand even if the timing is inconvenient for everyone.2 years later you may still be waiting for the crash that never came.. We will see, for now there is no sign this will burst so iam not adding but also not selling anything.Buy now, with the the government injecting another trillion dollar cash into the economy. There will be so much money floating around. There is no bubble. The market is undervalued right now due to inflation that is resulting.Ouch... I was sitting on cash in March (still am) and felt like a fucking idiot for not buying anything except very small postions in some ETFs. I can't imagine selling at the bottom and now seeing things even higher... I hope you at least sold for a profit

Why did you sell? Aren't you in for the long game?Patience is key. The reversal and correction is only a week or two away.and it worked out for him but he's warning people that it doesn't work out for everyone. A lot of people lost everything during that bubble.How is selling a company greedy? That's not how that works.He sold, he didn't kept ask for more. Not greedy.If the fed wasn’t doing what it is, the stock market would be in the shitter right nowWell Covid is not even close to being done yet and we're technically only 4 months into this "recession" so we really have no clue what's going just yet.A bull's nightmareyou do know theres a thing called a trailing stop loss which "moves it up a little bit each day" automatically, right?Yeah, the Nasdaq in 2000 was full of useless companies like.... Microsoft... Intel... Oracle...That net income graph is certainly ugly though.  I guess paying lots of fines for breaking the law adds up.

https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/net-incomeLol is this some kind of new revelation? It’s one of two possibilities. Either we experience another sharp decline or they keep rising. What was the point of this comment lmao?As long as USD is world reserve currency, Fed can essentially get away with unlimited printing. So 1929 crash is unlikely. Also since we’re on paper currency not backed by gold, Prolonged depression is almost impossible. What is possible and more likely is inflation. But that will be dealt with after the pandemic.Biden election could be the trigger. The market has been on an insane irrational tear the entire Trump presidency.Exactly. This world is like a cycle. Same shit every 100 years.Comments like this remind me why I disregard a lot of advice from this sub. One big boomer congregation. Tech is the future old man.Yeah it's all up in the air. They could happen to create an effective vaccine extremely early. If that happened, then that's the end of the crisis.yup. I was too scared to invest during the last crash even though I am sitting on tons of cash. I also have about 70k already invested in the market but I have even more in cash so I want this bitch to crash or at least dip like 20% to give me a better entry

How the fuck are all the big names worth MORE now than they were in January? MUCH more at that. I can understand why AMZN and some of the tech companies are (because tech can benifit people "working for home" like ZM, SHOP, MSFT, GOOG, but AAPL? Their stores were closed for a long ass time, there is tension in China and yet the stock was $320 in January and over $400 now.

Pissed I did not buy in...its been actually painful knowing I could have doubled or tripled my net worth in a few monthsWhen vaccine released and confirmed. Tech stock go down :)No doubt he was lucky, as most millionaires and billionaires are, but he's also an incredibly smart dude. If you've never listened to him in a non-reality show format you should.

https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/vox/recode-decode/e/68963574Yeah I agree. The guy with $5 billion that started off middle class. Pure luckI'm glad someone said this. Mark Cuban is of course very successful and intelligent. But, just because he has billions of dollars doesn't mean he is more intelligent than other businesspeople. You can see this on Shark Tank as people dismiss the other sharks just to get Cuban on their side. I agree with him in on this thread but he isn't the super financial genius everyone claims him to be.Finally someone pointing the factsBoomers are 56+ not 40+.To be fair, you’re taking advice from random strangers on Reddit with a high chance some of these people are teenagers.sarcasm? NFLX does not pay a div lolNoone's "trying very hard" to crash the market. It's just pretty unprecedented how far the market has gone up despite everything going on. Only a fool would think this is sustainable for another year of COVIDLol I thought you were serious until that last part.Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.That's what happens when you get a 10+ years old  bull market.To be fair, Buffet failed pretty hard to capitalize on 2020. 

That said, totally agree with you. Buffet is a legend, and literally every single person in this sub would trade portfolios with him in an high-frequnecy heartbeat..Buffet's way of investing has been dying for a decade now.Nothing wrong with that, at least you know what you're doing and understand the downside risk.Everything was dependent on how much grandmaster Fed stepped in and no one knew that.  If they hadn't we would've had a real crash and you would've looked like a genius.  The market is fucked b/c everything is dependent on 5 dudes sitting in a room playing with infinite money supply.  It's all bullshit.  But it was either that or hard crash.  They just chose option A with zombie companies over mass suicide and supply chain collapseNever kick yourself for money you could've made.

Only kick yourself for money you lost from bad investment decisions.Yeah I could have made more too, and am generally even with the S&P this year, but like Cuban said, "don't get greedy", just be glad your nestegg is still intactNo one could have predicted the quick upswing. I basically did what you did, but I had cash to buy companies I knew were beat up for no good reason as people exited their index funds.My two cents. It’s dangerous to think like that but I admit it’s easy to do when you’re surrounded (on Reddit) with people boasting huge profits. What you’re not seeing is the people who’ve been wiped out by the volatility in the last five months. 

I’m in a relatively similar position but I consider it to have been a valuable learning opportunity to have been somewhat sat on the sidelines. No body knows whats going to happen next with the economy and stock market, I’m sure there’ll be plenty of chances to get involved in the future. 

Good luck!hindsight is 20/20. this market is being propped heavily anyway so don’t be surprised when it all turns into a blood bath. 

also remember, time in the market always beats timing the market.I did the same to a certain extent, although did manage to sell 50% before the crash. The problem is, the stock I averaged into through March and April, whilst performing reasonably, have not performed nearly as well as others I considered (Lowes, Shopify, Visa being 3 of them). I put far too much into tankers, as I truly though the USA shutdown was going to last until at least middle of summer.  I will hold those bags though, as I do feel they will come around in 2021 as the world eventually returns to normal. I've averaged down on a lot of them as well, so my base price is now fairly reasonable. Just overweight in terms of % of portfolio I hold though. 

But yeah, sold at right time, but bought the wrong stuff going back up, so quite frustrated. Ended up with around 15-20% gains overall (if i compare portfolio value in late Jan to now), so not terrible at all. Just missed a bunch of rockets.For everything you have learned, or believe you would like to do, the game isn't over.

Everyday is literally a new day- you can start tomorrow, or a year later. Everything you have observed will repeat, it is all in the timing. Doesn't matter what political affiliation is in the office. There will be peaks, valleys, busts and Heaven breaking prices. TSLA isn't the only head scratcher out there, next week another one will begin. 

You haven't missed anything, you have only been preparing, learning for the next event. I am impressed with all the great advice Redditer's have provided, and your honesty with yourself. That is priceless. I hope you have a long history trading, and investing.>dy can predict the short term future. The best you can do is take an educated guess on com

Can you please elaborate on the python news script. I cannot get away from the madness of the news. I try to only read WSJ, a little bit of Bloomberg, and a little twitter for fun. But I can't avoid the crazies, the political talk, the trendy irony FinTwit smart guys, the pump and dump, the doomers, the euphorics. How do I develop news discipline?I got half my portfolio and back in and poured every dollar I could into the market during the dip was scary af considering I want to buy a house with those funds. Now, I'm short all my trades and going to get raped in taxes as Im going to buy a house sooner than I thought. Taxes gonna suck bad next year...nah WSB for sureWhat's your point? It's even more true now that the market is pricing in a V shape recovery for so many companies due to near zero rates, cheap cash, and hopes and dreams. You need a longer view of the market.He didn’t sell. He bought puts and sold calls to reduce put cost.He didn't sell, he hedged with put options at the peak and retained his fortune.I would guess that has more to do with supply chain breakdowns due to covid restrictions etcMeat in general has always been cheaper in the midwest, especially beef.

Could be supply catching up to demand especially considering the effect COVID has likely had on packing plants and slaughter houses.> My Costco even had to put up a sign assuring people that their profit margins haven't changed on those products

I work in the retail industry (corporate side), can confirm this is driven by increased costs and not inflationYeah I think that's largely because of the supply chain, somethings are going to go up in price as the meeting health requirements becomes more costly. Thing is, demand is down a lot too, so hard to tell where inflation will go overall.Groceries in general here in Denver are up significantly in the last couple monthsThis is a supply chain issue not a market inflationary one.Was listening to my SO dad complaining about paying $24 for a tenderloin sandwich that was MKT price. He's not one to really care about cost too much because their family has accumulated enough wealth to be comfortable so for him to mention it definitely piqued my interest and now reading this you're kind of confirming that.Philadelphia suburbs have the same thing postedTrue, but demand for lumber is at an all time high as everyone and their mother is working on home improvement projects. The demand for some other goods has plumeted. Inflation is tricky, there are people who study it for a living and still cant accurately predict it. 

If I had to make an educated guess I would say that we probably wont see much inflation in 2020.Your mission is complete. Now you can rest and watch the sun rise on a greatful universe.I didn’t buy much in March. I started getting stupid with penny stocks and lucked my way into 100% returns. Now I pulled my money from RH and I started reading the book a random walk down Wall StreetAny time you increase retirement contributions you deserve a pat on the back. 👋and long term investing is for suckers, playing options is the surefire way of making it big.I never quite understood that. I'd rather collect dividends for 30 years than hope a company's stock is going to hike 1000% over the same time periodThe problem is, the amount of companies offering dividends now (at least for common stock) are dwindling. You're basically stuck to energy and banks. Not even GE offers much in dividends anymore...He didn't specify when, I assume he meant the end movie version of him.Where did you learn about this from?Totally. That's been the plan. If this is 1929's evil twin, then it'll be sad to watch it all go away and not really recover for a chunk of my life :/Buying during the highs now is just plain stupid IMO. 

You could be holding a stock for 10 or more years when true corrections start to take place. 

If anything cost average in, I would not buy a big chunk right now these prices are ridiculous and everyone knows it. Once people start panic selling the herd will follow.I don't know I completely share the same sentiment. Historically we've recovered, especially with some patience. I suppose I am just feeling the fear that nothing is guaranteed. I've only been paying attention to the markets for a year, and I would just be sad to see the hard work I've put in evaporate. I acknowledge that's the name of the game.Value investing has been dead for 12 years. The stock market doesn't care about revenues and profits or fair value.  Even if investors all of the sudden gave a damn, the FED would step in and buy stocks up to nosebleed levels anyway.The next time the stock market sells off the FED will announce they are buying equities directly.  The central bank is literally buying the market.  This time is actually different. If they ever stop is when it will finally return to normal.Don't know how's it like in the US, but here in Europe house prices have had a lag of 4 years between the 2008 crash and the minimal point. Also the state intervened and basically imposed a minimum sale price through state backed credit lines. 

I was fortunate enough to buy at the minimum through that program. Now they set up the same program at prices that are higher than today's market. So a crash here seems unlikely

The next problem is rent. If I would have waited those 4 years between the top and the low, the rent I would have had to pay would offset about half of the price losses. Also, the good location houses didn't drop more than 25% in price and the bad location ones dropped by more than 75%, so yeah, location was extremely important.

Probably it's not a good idea to buy right now, but depending on how much the market can drop in your area, the price of good location houses, your income security, your overall exposure to risk, access to low interest credits, buying a house to live in can be good at any point in time thabks to the savings on rent.The fed's intervention is a pretty big factor, and the market "recovery" has tied pretty directly to the fed's expanding balance sheet.Yes but there not holding them up, there skyrocketing. Look at the 1 year on nasdaq. It is straight up. But thanks for a actual response. I appreciate it. And is that not terrifying to people that 4 stocks are holding up these indexes? I mean that seems super risky for big money.And what if they aren’t? What if their margins are hurt. Berkshire is essentially an Apple holding company. Advertisers are leaving Facebook in droves. We shouldn’t be comfortable in the fact the market is weighted on itself. That’s really really badYea, did you read why? Because of there profits from trading. Every single bank CEO on conference call said the worst is yet to come.   Everything else is down. You think the government is in panic mode getting more stimulus out because it's a V recovery?Why are they posting higher than every revenues? Think about that for a second. Where are those profits coming from right now? Is it them doing good business or something else?Did you? Hardly anyone sold out late Feb and bought back in at the March lows. I rode them out and sold out to buy undervalued Pacific Rim stocks.Only banks with investment divisions. Look at Wells Fargo. Also, did you fail to read that their loan default reserve funds are at all time highs. They sound so confident in the economy they’re hoarding money for an incoming wave of loan defaults.This is true, but when do you expect to see inflation spike? Its difficult to predict but it could be years. We could easily see zero inflation in 2020, and really only see it start to pick up in 2022. I agree its coming, but nobody knows when.New to most terms, what rates are we talking about?Worst advice ever... do not buy in at the ATH.I was up 300% when I sold, so I’m all good.  Wish I would’ve stuck around for that sweet 800% profit though.a Bear's dream....How do you do that on Robinhood?Maybe if you read you’d find Mark said it was something like 2001. 2001 sucked, but it only had lasting effects until like 2002. 1929 didn’t really stop sucking until WW2 and then right after that there was still a recession and things didn’t entirely stop sucking until 1950have you seen how much the dollar is down...? Its down a decent bit dudeHow long can the US survive on giving it’s citizens back it’s own money with no interest rates and everybody being in debt? 

How long can we just inflate our own shit? There’s no rules here. The laws of economics (Keynes or Austrian) have been turned off for a decade. They gotta come back on eventuallyI have no clue. It’s weird to speculate what would cause it. If you had “Flu pandemic” on your radar any earlier than November last year...I’d question your sanityIt might if Biden wins and the fed doesn't pump in as much liquidity as they have been. I mean, it's not like Trump was doing anything special before COVID, the general market growth rate has been the same since about 2009 (Obama). So, hopefully that's good news in that the president shouldn't make much difference in the market regardless of the election results.Have you looked at the S&P 10-year chart? The index did not grow any faster during Trump’s term than during previous years. In fact, the S&P surged slightly more during 2012-2016 than in 16-20.Bull run started in March 2009 and lasted more than 10 years.

While a change in administration leads to short term volatility it doesn’t really affect the market that much in the end. Biden isn’t exactly left wing either and he’s probably better for trade and less unpredictable.> Tech is the future old man.

No shit; but what the other person said still rings true: rules of economy will start working again. Just buckle up and enjoy the rollercoaster.

What kind of dumbshit is that, "tech is the future" yeah obviously.How long can the US survive on giving it’s citizens back it’s own money with no interest rates and everybody being in debt? 

How long can we just inflate our own shit? There’s no rules here. The laws of economics (Keynes or Austrian) have been turned off for a decade. They gotta come back on eventually 

FWIW....I’m 28.This time is different, right?Yolo it all on square bruhDude, the whole point of this post is in relation to the dot com bubble. Ya know, tech? Tech is volatile and trades on optimism. What happens when stocks start trading sideways and people lose optimism?Who says tech is nothing. But it will burst just like 1999.That’s kind of not the point. What are your thoughts on the bubble? 

Those that are 40+ I’m assuming have retirement accounts and should be careful. Investment banks are the ones bailed out during a crash, not an individual trader.pretty easy to say that but did you do it? Did you buy in in March when we were dropping 10% a day? I was (and am) sitting on tons of cash. I feel like a fucking moron because I was not being greedy when others were fearful, but, I was fearful. All the "experts" talking about a "great depression" blah blah blahOverrated quote just like most of the 50 years old advice regurgitated here

Capitalise on greed AND fear is more fittingThe weird thing is people have been saying stock are overpriced and there is no logic behind pricing for YEARS, but the market keeps on going to the moon.  It's like there is a disconnect with everything going on in the world.This is an extreme anomaly, and one of the biggest principles of Buffet is that more important than making good bets and winning money in the stock market is "don't lose any money", it can't take you years and years to overcome loses, ofc someone can win the lottery several times in a row but it is extremely rare and is not a real path to become rich for most investors. None could have guessed that this bull market would last 10 years the same way none can predict what will happen the next decade, in his philosophy is better getting 15% of something with 90% certainty than losing most of it in a riskier bet.The bull market ended in March, even by the stupid 20% definition that everybody here kept touting.Market rebounded so fast he never had a chance. It’s bit more difficult for Buffett to take positions or buy a company.Capitalize on a fake bubble year? With recession looming?He's been capitalizing for YEARS.  His position size is huge, so he's not looking to size up and just get out in a few months for a quick buck.  He's not a swing trader.  He's a long-term VALUE investor.  The valuation of stocks is clearly too high, and that is why Warren Buffet is sitting on cash.  His next investment is going to last longer than he will.. I'm sure he wants to go out on a good note (even if it's on cash).>To be fair, Buffet failed pretty hard to capitalize on 2020.

What does that mean? Warren Buffet sits on 150 billion dollars. He couldn't have moved at the same pace the market moved due to the size of his capital. Also his philosophy isn't to buy just because there's a down turn. It's to buy a good company at a bargain price.2020 is not yet over. Wait and watch.Covid was a black swan event, trying to play in this situation is basically a coin tossI got out a little bit late, but when I saw the market spring back up I bought half of my portfolio in and I've made 150% gains already this year.  Buffet was smarter than me, he got out earlier.  He got back in too late though.  He was too safe.  He had to realize it was an election year and Trump will do anything to keep the economy going.It's not an infinite money supply. They borrowed it against the 20 trillion dollar/year  and the 100 trillion dollar net worth of the US.I *know* my IRA and mutual funds are the safe option when I'm "poor".

I *know* that the extra 500 I put towards my emergency fund savings account was the 'smart' option.

But by golly it is hard to see that 20/20 hindsight of TSLA dropping to $3xx and *not* kick myself for not buying the 3 stocks of it I could have stretched forWise words. Username checks out.> also remember, time in the market always beats timing the market. 

This saying is intended to be interpreted as "don't short-term trade the markets, invest long term".

But right now this is probably a terrible advice.So as someone about to start investing more, what do I need to know? That the bubble is about to pop and everything is going to go down?IF[deleted]wsb makes/loses money regardless of the market going up or down, cuz they mainly trade optionsLike everywhere: you need to dig through dirt to find real gems at WSB 💎I don’t look at WSB so I wouldn’t knowMy point is at some point, the bubble will burst and everyone will run for exits.  SPX now b/w 2800 / 3000 seems more reasonable.Which is exactly what one should do in this bizarre market. Don't sell because nobody knows how high this can go, but do hedge heavily.Can someone ELI5 this concept? Or link me a decent resource to learn how to do this?So basically he broke even? Is there more upside to this than just going cash?Absolutely.  Some of the big processing plants shut down.  I've been hearing cattle and pigs going for 1/4 their typical price from ranchers who suddenly lost their infrastructure.What I remember about mad cow was that the fast food prices rose like 50% and when mad cow was over they never came back downIf the price is inflating, does it matter what's making inflate?Increased costs are inflation...[deleted]Not until I snap all "then's" into "than's".Such a good book that really puts in perspective how many ways there are to make money investingAdded to my reading list. Thanks!I'm a long term investor, but they aren't wrong that options are how you make it big and can be done quickly. But long-term investing is a MUCH safer way to make money. Not to mention one bad option can wipe out years of good positions.Yea buht what if you bought X amount of shares of Y stock back back the 198Z when it was a penny stock like apple lmao /s(I agree with value add of dividends.) It seems more and more companies are less focused on dividends and more focused on share value. I think newer investors and younger people don't have the same appreciate for a dividend because of this.Is there something like firecalc that uses only dividends?$T is pretty goodFrom the movie The Big Short.It only goes away if you sell, provided you are investing in proper tickers and not shitty pennies.If you're 27, it "going away and not really recovering" for a chunk of your life is the greatest gift you could be given as an investor. More buy cycles at lower cost.Are you hoarding cash?Do you know why the stock price of those companies that reported negative revenues/profits in the last 2 weeks went down?So you mean like bailing out certain companies? Nationalizing almost? Like they did the banks in 2008?This is just the signal for you to place your bet on who gets to be Umbrella Corporation.they're* (as in they are)Where else do you put your money?? 

Cash- threat of inflation will crush your cash

GOV Bonds- no yield, covid recovery will crush bond values

Corp Bonds- risk of defaults

Foreign Markets- uh...where?


TINA. It’s all TINA.And if they aren't profitable and it ends up being a permanent issue, then yes the US market's going to tumble quite a bit. To reduce any downside of that happening, I have significant holdings in gold, foreign company stocks and a bit in VIX ETFs as well. Investing always carries a risk, especially in today's high volatility environment. The best that you can do is diversify so that no matter what happens, something in your portfolio is going to grow in value.Time will tellThat's above my pay grade lol. All I know are two things:

1. P(fed willingly raises rates) < P(fed raises rates due to unexpected inflation)

2. Many new investors are unaware of the second half of that equation. In fact I think many Americans have this idea that the fed funds rate is purely a political instrument, since many of them were largely oblivious as to how the fed operates before this administration.How would all of this money that the has been pumped into the economy in recent months not cause inflation? Genuine question. Just doesn't make sense that it wouldn't cause some major inflation soon.The federal reserve can indirectly "control" interest rates in general by setting the Fed Funds Rate at different levels and announcing certain target ranges. When rates are low it's cheap to borrow money so people buy homes, companies borrow cash to reinvest in their businesses, and the economy grows. 

The Fed also prints money but the thing a lot of people don't understand is that the amount of money printed isn't pre-determined by the Fed. When you go get a mortgage at the bank, they aren't necessarily lending you money from other people's deposits or money that the bank has, they're creating the money to lend you through manipulating their balance sheet. This means that money shows up in an account out of thin air. If that money goes into circulation it can cause inflation. When rates are low, more money gets created.

In general the Fed wants to cut rates when the economy is in trouble because low rates stimulate economic activity. Raising rates has the opposite effect, it lowers economic activity, reins in inflation, and causes businesses and individuals to lower expenses in general which can lead to rises in unemployment and lower production capability.

During the past decade of bull markets rates never went up. So now that shit hit the fan the fed has to simulate cutting rates by pumping cash into the economy, which is called "quantitative easing" or more commonly abbreviated to QE. This is why the market can do well despite most of the economy "shutting off" during the pandemic. The problem is that if we start to see inflation go out of control, the fed will have to stop QE and potentially raise rates even if they know it will cause major economic problems for years to come. Because the effects of hyperinflation are even worse than another recession/depression. 

So basically what I'm saying is that anyone can say "the fed has no reason to raise rates" because it's obviously true that they don't want to. But if inflation forces their hand it ceases to matter that it's an inconvenient time to raise rates because there is an imminent threat of hyperinflation. But it's not an exact science to predict inflation. If I print and give you $2000 you might go and spend it on shit and contribute to inflation, or you might go buy stocks or bonds and pump up those markets, or you might just put it in a savings account where it doesn't inflate the money supply at all.Damn, nice! Can't complain about 300% man. Mind me asking how long it took you to get that return?

Its funny, people say 10% a year is a good return but the past 10 years have been crazy. My mom uses a financial advisor and the overall market (S and P 500) has beaten her portfolio every year the past decade. Her advisor sucks ass. I told her to buy TSLA last year, the dude owns and TSLA but said "he would never buy the stock ever and tell your son not to either"

I listened to him..oohhh how I hate him. And, myself, for not buying it in march when it dipped below $400theta gang wins in that scenario aka no one winsI think a bear's dream would be multiple sharp drops with interim bear rallys to continually short stocks.No, bears want hard, fast crashes.

If it's a slow decline then you'll lose money from shorting stocks since you need to pay interest while shorting if you hold overnight. Most margin rates are around 6% annually. 

If you short via puts then you lose money due to theta decay. This can be avoided if you buy deep in the money options.I don't think it's the same.  Liquidity is at insane levels right now. 1929 was dry as a boneLook at USD index. It’s still way off from all time low.Nobody knows how long this will last. EU and Russia have been buying gold reserves for years now. May be they are hoping world will back to gold standard. 

May be it will. May be not. One thing is for sure. Interest rates gotta rise. They can’t or at least shouldn’t print dollar forever. We’re essentially in unchartered territory and are borrowing heavily from our future generations.[Stocks surged the day after he was elected](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/us-markets.html), more than 2 months before he even took office.

You're concerned with the US government giving money to it's own citizens but not it's handling of the pandemic, among a myriad of other issues?

You're 28, how did you make it this far?> This time is different, right?  

You know this is the top when people are always finding new, creative ways to say it is different this time without uttering those 4 magic words. Thank goodness my job is relatively secure. When music stops, it's going to absolutely glorious.Go buy gold bars or some shit"The market can stay irrational for a lot longer than you can stay solvent."

\-Ancient Chinese proverb, Albert Einstein, Ron Howard maybe, idkYeah its honestly mad. i though stocks (particularly tech) were overvalued BEFORE Covid was a thing.  Then Covid happened, and they crashed in March and I though "Ok this makes sense now", but the almost instantaneous turnaround has completely baffled me (outside of the blatant Fed interference). 
Like I do not know what kind of investor is looking at Tesla at $1700 and thinking "yep, this is *exactly* the time and price to be getting into that."

Jsut mad. I already sold 50% in February, but have rebought through March and April and done reasonably well (although could have been a lot better). I'm thinking of doing the same again now.  I really do feel once the unemployment top ups run out at end of July that could be one of the first cards to tumble.....I imagine this is exactly how bubbles feel like when you are in them. Once you lose the touches to the edge of the market, it doesn’t matter how far away the edges are from you

Edit: grammar and clarityThose are called castles in the sky. There is no foundation to the bubble but people keep buyingMore money chasing few products. Simply supply and demand. Yes, eventually the equilibrium will swing the opposite way but for now stocks are the place to be. So consider pulling back when there are other viable investment options.The problem with the wording this Buffet quote uses is prices are always relative, and so "losing money" is only meaningful in terms of opportunity costs.

Sitting at the sidelines in a bull market is a loss, even if you can't explain why stonks keep going up.Bigger problem for Berkshire is the Fed solved the liquidity crisis within a few days. A lot of Berkshire's best trades are when companies need funds quickly and they can negotiate quick financing and get massive warrant coverage. 

While the liquidity crisis is totally solved, the bigger question is going to be whether or not we have a solvency crisis start to creep up in the next 6 months or year.He had a chance to take a bath on his Airline position. Coulda bought more Apple at around $220 or any of the several other companies.There's such a thing as short-term gains on a rebounding marketThe term "bubble year" doesn't even mean anything to an investor like Buffett, who famously does his best to disregard macro. Buffett likes to buy good value companies, not good value indices. If it weren't for a handful of big tech names the index would still be in correction territory, so ostensibly there should be good buys out there for Buffett.

The guy pointing out the fact that the Fed stepped in so fast and took the cheese from Buffett's plate is right. Distressed companies come to Buffett with favourable terms and it's up to Buffett to decide whether the terms are good enough. This time around companies did not get desperate enough to come to Buffett with the type of terms that he's interested in.People also don't seem to understand that 5% of 120 billion is  hell of a lot more than the 200% gains they made with their 10k. The sheer size of his capital alone means that he'll still make more money than most taking the safest route possible.Easy to say in hindsight, confirmation bias.I follow TSLA extremely closely and I bought 10 shares at the Feb high of $918, only to watch those shares drop nearly 2/3rds when COVID hit. (I also had no more money to buy at $3xx so I just stood by and watched)

But now, obviously I'm feeling pretty good about buying some shares at $918.

My point is, nobody can predict the short term future. The best you can do is take an educated guess on companies that will be larger next year than they are today. If you do that consistently, the money comes easy.

But, if you try to time the market or make other risky short term trades, that's when people lose a lot of money.It's never terrible advice. One particular action (investing plan) can't be removed from the long term plan. Investors who are very disciplined who always follow their certain rules, can live by that sword. In markets like 2020, having a plan is the upmost important. I wish I was that disciplined. Yes, you can make a boatload this summer, but will everyone keep that boatload, or hit the lighthouse and sink. Investing isn't 6 weeks or 6 months unless you get out. If you are an investor, it's 10, 20, 40 years. That is tough to do, to have your cake and still be eating off it 40 years later thru all the market tribulations.

Many on Reddit may not understand that- but the fact is what we do in 6 months is a fart in 40 years of investing, having some level of security down the road when you aren't working. Sorry for rambling, but much of the sage advice I am reading on this thread shows some real insight for many under 30 yr olds I am guessing. Little is **terrible advice** if you still have your money. Singles also win games as the big guys get tired swinging. I'd give my eye teeth if I just made 7% for the last 40 yrs without some stupid zero wins. Time at 7% trumps all.As long as the feds keep that interest lowHow is it gambling? You have no idea what I bought or what my situation is. Who the fuck are you to say something like this.Wsb is gamblers anon but instead of trying to quit encouraging eachotherNothing wrong with having a laugh watching people lose moneyTry. It’s def the best sub on RedditAh ok, I misunderstood youWhat do you hedge for and doesn’t it reduce your potential performance?So let's say you own 1000 shares of Tesla. Nobody knows what direction Tesla ia going to go, it could crash down or go back to the moon. So to hedge/protect your position you could buy puts on Tesla which gives you the right to sell 100 shares of Tesla at an agreed upon price. This would hedge your position because if the price of Tesla falls the value of your puts would go up. Now buying puts can be expensive, so to cover the cost of that you would sell   calls on the Tesla stock you already own giving someone else the right to buy from you at an agreed upon price, and use the premium from selling your calls to pay for your puts you just bought. 

The only disadvantage to this strategy is if Tesla really moons your going to miss out on more profit because the calls you sold are going to get exercised and your shares of Tesla are going to get called away for a lower price then what Tesla is currently trading at in this scenario. But profits are still profits, and this strategy protects you from losing bad if the "Tesla bubble" pops. (Idk if it's actually a bubble, Idk anything anymore in this market)People are trying to explain PUTs and CALLs by saying "Your put goes up in value". That doesn't help someone new understand the concept. 

These "options" are literal contracts that give the purchaser of the contract the right but not the obligation to buy or sale a stock at an agreed upon price. And not just a single share but 100 shares. That's just the way the contract is written. If I own 100 shares of Microsoft I can write and sell a contract that says I will give you any gains if the stock goes up. Why would I do that? Well, if I don't think the stock will go up but I still want to make a little off my investment then I write and sell a contract. I'm selling you the right to buy my Microsoft shares at an agreed upon price. And you give me a small amount of money (called the premium) to have the option to buy my Microsoft shares. 

A real world analogy could be a real estate investor purchasing a contract that gives him the right to buy in a certain neighborhood. He may pay $5k for the right to buy but he still doesn't have to. And the contract has an expiration date. He won't have the right forever. If housing prices go up then he gets to buy at the previous value and has instant equity. If prices go down he technically could still buy at that price but that wouldn't be very smart. It would be better to just let the contract expire and buy a house at market price. 

That is a CALL option. You have the right to buy someone else's shares at an agreed price before the expiration date. 

On the flip side a PUT is the right to sell and push a stock to someone else which forces them to buy. If I have a bunch of cash and I want to buy a stock but I think the price is too high then I can sell you a contract and I will agree to buy your shares if the stock drops to an agreed price. If it drops even further then I will technically be taking a loss. 

The idea behind options is to manage risk. The person selling options is selling risk. The person buying options is buying risk. We don't know what the future will bring. Some people are more or less risk averse. 


Bob is very risk averse so he is willing to give up some of his "potential" large gains in return for a guaranteed small gain. He is happy to have more certainty and the buyer of his call option is happy to take on more risk with the potential for a higher return. 

Sandy also risk averse and doesn't want to buy a stock just to have it's value go down the next day. She also doesn't want her cash to just sit around and not earn anything. She is happy to earn a guaranteed small return by selling PUT options and if the stock falls and she is forced to buy then she is happy she got the stock she already wanted at a cheaper price. 

Jim moves 100k of his investment into SPY and to hedge his investment he spends $500 buying SPY PUTs. He is using a PUT like a home owner uses insurance. You don't want your house to burn down but if it does you get a check to help cover the costs. But you pay a premium for that insurance. 

Retards at WSB just use it like gambling.Ah. Honestly you are better off googling “Put and Call options in stock market” and start from there. 

Can’t link specifics but there are tons on YouTube videos on this stuff too.If you are 100% hedged it means you don't earn any money if your longs go up but don't lose any money if your longs go down.  Might as well sit in cash.  Having said that I do have a 10% hedge with SPY puts and a 20% hedge in gold and gold miners.A quick search for "costless collar" should give some good infoIt's called a synthetic short if you want to look it upyou own 100 tesla stock and you put those 100 up for either a CALL or a PUT, you set the price of where you think it'll go and wait until some idiot buys your contract. 

You're ELI5 betting your own inventoryInteresting, prices do have a certain stickiness but i wonder how much of that might be coordinated by a certain step or steps along the beef supply chain wanting to increase profits and realizing that consumers will pay the higher prices

It would be illegal if it was coordinated or monopolistic but i suppose it could happen somewhat naturally in a free marketYes it absolutely does.

What you’re implying is like saying the USD gains value when items are put on a clearance rack at a store.

Currency inflation isn’t automatically associated with a products price.The fact that it has to do with the cost of the supply chain means it should be easier to drop the prices at a later date if/when those chains are back to normalYes, because that's only one type of product whereas the CPI has not really changed AFAIKWhy would you think that someone would lie about that. I was referring to glen mills. Yes, it does. King of Prussia did as well. Not sure if they still do.Yeah I think it’s great so far. I kind of want to wait to see how all this plays out before I start putting a ton of money into it. It feels like such a huge bubble. But I’m also someone with an Ag background so I could be wrongI don't think you know how options work if you think one bad "option" can wipe out years of positions. When you're BUYING options, you can only lose the principal put up, it cannot go negative. (if you buy $1000 worth of call options you can only loose $1000. You cannot buy options on margin) So, unless you are stupid enough to bet years of profits on a single option trade, you cannot get wiped out in a single trade

SELLING options? Different story. If you're SELLING options you can lose much more than you started with and wipe yourself out with one bad trade but you should only be selling options if you're experienced/are knowledable 

I made over 40k (Canadian dollars) selling options. I literally made 25k in 4 trading weeks recently (only because I was taking massive amounts of risk, getting returns like that selling puts is unheard of. I thought I was being smart, I was gambling) I was super upset I missed the march bottom and was revenge trading... broke rule number one, leave emotion out of it.

 I lost it all AND more in one week because I opened up wayyy too many put spreads ALL in the tech sector. When you sell a put, you instantly are paid a "premium", it is added to you cash balance instantly. if the stock stays above the puts price, you get to keep that full premium. So, selling puts on tech stocks were like free money to me and I got blinded by greed. I was not even calculating how much I would lose, just how much profit I would make... If the stock price falls below the put, you get assigned the shares at the price you sold the put for BUT I was selling put SPREADS. And, if lose on those, you lose. You do not get to keep any stock and just hold to make back your gains

So, yeah. Selling options is much more consistent money than buying options, which, can be almost like straight up gambling. Selling options is a great way to increase gains as long as you do not take on too much risk at a time and hedge yourself/do not sell spreads unless you can afford to take assignment of the stock. I was selling spreads on big names like SHOP and AMZN. Each spread I was selling would be equal to 300 shares and I was selling several at a time. Pure greed and stupidity.I mean yes and no. Cuz if it takes 30 years to come back, you never really had it.Do you?Wesker....wheeeeeeeere’s Wesker?ThanksWell played. In the long run you’ll come out ahead  either wayAbsolutely.  Good luck to you sir. Make some money or try not to lose it all lolIt'll certainly cause inflation but it really comes down to how much of that money actually enters into circulation, as well as the shutdown's effect on production capability. If people have more money and want to spend it on stuff, and we can scale up production to meet that need, there is no inflation. 

Let's say I make hammocks. If all of a sudden everyone wants to spend their stimulus check on a hammock I either need to increase the number of hammocks I produce or increase the price of my hammocks in order to reduce the demand. If I can scale up my production then the price of my hammocks has not inflated, even though the money supply has grown. If I increase the price then we have inflation, unless another hammock maker scales up production and sells at a lower cost to compete with me. 

Inflation = Dollars in Circulation - Production Capability

Right now I believe that most people's needs are still being met. We have the capability to provide the essential products and services that people expect. I suspect as more entertainment centered businesses open we will see more noticeable inflation. For example I've been trying to buy a kayak for months and it's literally impossible to find a store with them in stock (unless you want an inflatable one). People are going to come out of this with cash to spend and we all know how sensitive Americans are to perceived "price gouging," so the only alternative is to just accept shortages, lines, crowds, and eventually inflation until it settles down.Because there’s high global demand for USDReplying so I can study this later. Thank you for a detailed response, I've been lurking these subs for a few months and this cleared up a lot for me.>When you go get a mortgage at the bank, they aren't necessarily lending  you money from other people's deposits or money that the bank has,  they're creating the money to lend you through manipulating their  balance sheet. This means that money shows up in an account out of thin air.  

Careful, a lot of people here will get mad if you try and say banks loan out more more money than they have. A lot of people don't understand that banks create money.Huh saving this Not sure how accurate this is because I know very little on the subject, but wow very well said!Took me 3.5 years to get 300%.  It was a scary 3 years though.  TSLA was all over the place for awhile.  It’s funny because everything people are saying now, like it’s way overvalued and it’ll correct soon, was the same thing everyone was saying when the price was $220.  The bottom line is that if you believe it’s a good long term company you should buy the stock whenever you can.  I should’ve bought more shares when it tanked, but hindsight is 20/20 right?  Hope I don’t make the same mistake again.How can i become part of the gang that never loses?true1929 happened because super hyped low credit massive debt and fear. First bank run happened then continue bank runs them massive selling 

What happens with massive unemployment, no one can pay their rent/mortgage, there’s already a car bubble equivalent to that of the housing bubble, massive debt (no one can afford a $500 emergency), 0% interest rates, Trillions of dollars worth of QE already used? This is a recipe for disaster 

Right now, economics are turned off. Stonks go up, go pow go pow. When they get turned back on...shit will hurt> Republicans are better for the stock market than Democrats

Ya, Republicans have done a good job at associating themselves with wealth so I can see why that narrative is popular. It doesn't line up with the charts though. Four of the last 5 major crashes all started while a Republican was president; I'm not blaming them either though -- that seems to be purely coincidental since there isn't any obvious link between their actions and the crashes. But it's worth pointing out because that makes it even more silly to equate one party with being better for the stock market since it doesn't appear to matter.

What does matter is when companies make money, and good companies make money regardless of which party is in power.https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterlazaroff/2016/07/26/democrats-vs-republicans-who-is-better-for-the-stock-market/#5efbd5b0239d

But generally Republicans do worse?I'm all for spirited discussions, but there's no need to be a dick about their age. That's some A1 boomer steak sauce right there.If you’re going to quote me, do it correctly. I’ve never discounted this pandemic. It is because this pandemic and my concern of massive layoffs and people not making their rent/mortgages that o bring this up. 30% of people missed their mortgage payment for July and that’s with the $600 a week unemployment.

I said the laws of economics will return, you must not know what they are to make such ignorant statements.I agree wholeheartedly.Both gold and tech are doing well, and will continue to do well.I should buy some TSLA I think. There is a new paradigm in the market and only boomers ignore it. Right?You know gold has been on a tear right? I wouldn't make fun of an asset that's up 50% in a year. On top of that it's a great market hedge, and a hedge against inflation which is a pretty good idea since the fed is pumping so much fucking moneyLOLUm, I think Tom Hanks said that in Mandarin Chinese.
I hope that helps.

(Check Wikipedia in about 10 minutes. )Same here. I have already started to sell again, I am staying at tech and selling s&p 500 futures. I have sold 3/4 the amount I was in February, but planning to go further and maybe get into the net short zone.With TSLA specifically, it’s the next Apple- it’s like moving from flip phones to smartphones. And cars aren’t even their only product!Oh tell me why...Buffett isn’t a trader.  His game is long and RN, traders are conflating the two concepts trading vs investing.  IMOBuffet doesn’t really believe in “short term gains.”Also such a thing as short term security and long term gainsYou're right.  It is confirmation bias.  He saw earlier than me to gtfo, but he saw too late it was going to recover.  So while he did a good job minimizing risk he fucked up in getting back in.Wise move not to have sold when the price dropped so much. My compliments to your discipline. That was a priceless lesson you learned, and shared with others.It's crazy that even buying shares at $918 still led to it being a good move. I would play around a bit more with it, and maybe hit a few winners, but right now it's just hit that IRA limit, save for a house, train for a better job, maybe try real estate, procrastinate, cry; not necessarily in that order.


I'm still a buy-n-hold investor if I do have some extra $$ to play with, so far my guesses have been on AMD and ENPH, along with some random WeBull stocks.I don't trade but WSB is the best forum on reddit, it's hilarious.They also can give you good advice and have knowledgeable traders. Just gotta lookI feel personally attackedI don't know why everyone shits on WSB. The real DD over there is vastly better than anything on /r/stocks or /r/investing. It's a different style, and there is definitely "loss porn" and lots of yolos, but there are also posters who really know their shit.Wait rill that happens to you so we can laughI’m good. Thanks thoughI'll buy gold, TLT, maybe some VIXM if it's been falling continually for several days. Perhaps hedge isn't the right word and instead I just prefer to buy inversely correlated or uncorrelated assets. So far they haven't had too much of an impact on my portfolio performance as long as I rebalance frequently.Thanks for clear explanation!Is this the same concept as a vertical debit spread? I heard this might be a good strategy to get exponential gains like an option, but also use risk managementThx for this! Helped a lotWhat would be an alternative method to hedge your holdings without having to go the options route? Are there shares that can be bought that counteract the market (like VXX etc.)?I never understood this concept, wouldn't it be better to just sell it off instantly instead of waiting for a specific date? Or are we looking at let's say 1 dollar slowly climbing and you sell them for 2 dollars in a month. Mind explaining it to me?Thank you. This is the best explanation on here so far bc it doesn’t assume the reader already knows basic concepts. A lot of those basic concepts aren’t really taught. You also provided really clear, easy to follow examples.Hey man just wanted to say thanks for your explanation.Damn that’s a long as explanation just say a put option is basically insurance premium on your shares.depends on the hedge. not all are linear. for example if you buy OTM puts you will basically be 100% hedge for 100 shares for every contract you buy once it starts to get substantially ITM but your loses will be no where lose to 100% when the stock rises.

that said generally 100% hedge is way too expensive to be worthwhile unless you are trying to hedge over a very short period(and most of the time if there really is a period like that it still will probably be insanely expensive due to increased premiums since it is not like everyone else is going to forgot there is an important legal decision or earnings call).You don't need to own shares to sell puts, just for covered callsFood is excluded from inflationIt indicates value overwrites momentum and wins in the long run.fo' sho- I keep Grammar Nazism alive.Good luck to you too. Also i wont need my invested money for the next 3 years soThat is a great explanation. Thank you. Now I want a hammock.Np. I feel like the thing people are most skeptical of is the part about retail banks being allowed to create money by writing loans, but that's really a thing. Everyone was told growing up that banks work by loaning out the money in people's checking accounts, when in reality that's not directly a constraint on their lending limit at all. There are obviously reserve requirements though.write optionsThe QE is ammo for stuff like this. Economics aren’t turned off. A lot of people are out of work. A lot of people have more income free and since there are sub par interest rates in banks the equity market has seen massive influx of new traders, look at Robin Hood for example. All this money has to go somewhere (Tesla, apple, Amazon, etfs) this has real effects on the market. Not this “j POW money printer stonks only go up” that’s a very childish view and just a copy paste from Wall Street bets. Either get in for the long run and ignore what everyone else is doing and stay focused using DCA or try timing the market and get burned just like every other time traders thought they can time the market.> since there isn't any obvious link between their actions and the crashes.

Doesn’t seem like an effective hedge then?But don't do this with Tesla because the options premiums are batshit insane. Apple, maybe.No problem, took me awhile to learn this stuff so I try to help when people have questions.I just replied to another comment beneath my original comment explaining vertical debit spreads a bit. I'd link it, but I'm not the best with that kind of stuff on reddit lolI'm not sure what your asking.. by "it" are you referring to the option contact? People don't exercise until expiration (unless dividends are involved) because the premium of the option could further increase in value.Just need available buying power to sell puts unless you are approved for unsecured puts through your broker.Correct, and it should be because it is a core staple and pricing can be very volatile, as we are seeing now.

So to answer your question again, yes, it does matter what's making it inflate because "inflation" doesn't mean "price volatility due to temporary supply chain restrictions"For every stock that goes down on revenue and profit declines I can show you 3 that go up for the same reason.  Fact is, you nor I know the exact reason why a particular stock goes in the direction it does.Lol made me laugh.and a kayakJust don't be like me using all of your accounts margin buying power to write $30 wide weekly put spreads on big tech companies, make 40k in 2 months and then be in the negative because I just kept writing bigger, wider and closer to the money spreads and last week tech took a shit so I lost all my gains

I was a fucking moron. I was doing great with theta, I started with just naked puts but after seeing how much the stocks I was selling puts on had mooned and realizing I would have made 100's of % had I just BOUGHT SHARES in the stocks I  started "revenge trading"

writing options is a great way to increase gains. I am DONE with spreads though. At least with naked puts if I lose, I get assigned stock and will eventually make the money back. FUCK YOU PUT SPREADS (joking, selling way OTM spreads can be easy money in a bull market. I was just a greedy fuck)I guess I wasnt sarcastic enough with all of my retarded comments.Plus Teslas are built like complete shit and have among the worst build quality and quality controlI actually lold at this. xDWell it was a reference to that corny song but I do appreciate this explanation as well.

Those 4 dollar buy-in's last month feel so so much better after reading your comment."loss porn" lol

There was a guy recently went from something like $8000 to almost a million and then back down to $4000 and everyone tells him not to give up, he still has $4000 left to YOLOI love WSB because it’s literally people offering to give away money.Just consider it an "it lets me sleep better at night" investment.Nope. Last week listened to the “TSLA going up to 2k” and got burned. Many of us get in trouble with NFLX and TSLA last week. Will be cautious nowIf your selling calls it might make up for the put purchase.If you don’t mind I actually do have a question:

How would you compare CALL DEBIT vs PUT CREDIT spread strategies?

Let’s say you’re feeling neutral to bullish? Which one is better or more favorable? Your opinion? Thanks 🙏Thanks for the heads up, I wouldn’t have known otherwise lol. I’ve been fairly good recently at setting up indicators to know when a stock price is going to go up. I’m wondering if a option spread vs a put spread would be more beneficial. At the same time, a lot of this sounds like Spanish to me, I’m not too familiar with how all this works. And how to buy spreads on thinkorswim so I will have to study up so I don’t fuck myselfYeah, cash secured puts. But like I said, you don't need to already own shares. That only applies to covered calls.

In sure you already know this, but to anyone else who happens to read this, don't sell unsecured puts on margin or naked calls unless you're comfortable going bankrupt.Just hang a kayak between two trees. Problem solved!Haha good. Bubble-riders don't realise that they sound like every bubble-rider before them, just with different stocks.Mr beast just put up a 100k investment of the highest upvoted commentThat was your DD? Heard TSLA going to 2k? Lol.Disclaimer, I don't trade spreads very often, but it really depends on the premiums. Both spreads are  bullish positions, but a debit spread is probably more bullish because to achieve maximum profit the stock most move above the short call.

Call debit requires that you put money up first, and then realize maximum profits when the stock price moves above the short call. To enter a debit spread you buy a call and sell call with the same expiration dates but different strike prices. Your max loss is the difference between the premiums spent on purchasing the long call and selling the short call. Your max profit is the spread between the two strike prices minus what you put up to buy the long call. You buy a 80 call for 3, sell a 85 call with the same expiration date for 2, for a difference of 1($100 your max loss) if the stock moves above 85 both contacts will be assigned allowing you to buy 100 shares for 85 and sell 100 shares for 90, resulting in $500 minus the 100 you already spent for a maximum profit of 400.

A put credit spread allows you to make money first, and then assume the risk after. To enter a put credit spread you buy a put and then sell a put with a higher strike price. You're maximum profit is the difference between the two strike prices. You buy a put at 80 for 1, and then sell a put at 85 with the same expiration date and collect a premium of 3 giving you a max profit of 2($200). Your maximum loss in this scenario would be 300, the difference between the strike prices and premium collected. 

In a neutral/bullish position a put credit spread would appear to be the better option because you don't need the stock to move very much to make a profit, it just can't go down. A debit credit spread requires the stock to move upwards to achieve maximum profits.You do realize I was being sarcastic when I wrotethe first post, right? Some People didnt get the hint.More money than sense or actually crazy"This DD is brought to you by the creative minds at WSB"My friends who trade and with whom I share positions were super bullish on TSLA as well as NFLX. Also, I am not going to lie - WSB did have some influence on top of that. Bought into the hype. Learning experience I guess. Amazon and Dominos Pizza helped to minimize the lossThanks for the comparison in detail and clear examples. I knew both positions are bullish but now it gives me a better perspective. I think your explanations are clear, concise, and straight to the point so many people would benefit from them. You may consider to post sometimes about different options strategies, etc. Ability to explain things is a great skill. Just my 2 cents. Thank you for making these two strategies clear and easy to grasp 🙏I suspected so, but my joke still stands, although not aimed at you in particular.Thanks, I appreciate the appreciation. I'm more of a lurker that provides help when I can, idk about posting, but I'll consider it in the future. Good luck with your trades!Lots of pleasantries lol Thanks! Same to you. You did help me and that’s the biggest value on Reddit! Hopefully I can become better trader!Nothing could’ve prepared me for a post about cauliflower in this sub todayAlot of people are clowning on you but I think its a unique question. Like anything, cauliflower could be the next big thing for food or just a temporary trend. Still a good question[removed]Buy cauliflower farmFarms won't be on the stock market. You would need to look at stuff like birds eye or other sellers and see if they are being publicly traded on the stock market.

 You could also privately buy in to something but that is a little harder often. A lot of farmers around me allow you to buy into the crops when they plant and you get a percentage of profit when they sell but that would require you to know farmers probably.Start wrestling and you can grow your investment on your ear.

But seriously, directly you can go with cauliflower futures contracts (don't even know if this is a traded commodity to be honest). Or indirectly, look at businesses that will be adding cauliflower related products to their offerings. The impact of this to overall stock price will be debatable though.

$LAND, Gladstone Land, investor presentation [here](https://ir.gladstoneland.com/static-files/2c525ba0-7dee-43a3-b13d-1f024cccd471)

It's a farmland REIT. Now, I don't believe they own any cauliflower farms directly, but they do specialize in non-row crops. So think either permanent crops (almonds, pecans, etc) and speciality annual crops (think strawberries, lettuce, etc). Basically fresh produce and nuts, rather than grains, which the other farmland REIT $FPI, specializes in.

While LAND might not have cauliflower directly:

1) tenants could potentially convert current farmland to cauliflower production if the trend continues. It shouldn't be hard to convert a lettuce farm to cauliflower if demand for the latter booms enough to offset switching costs. 

2) the value of the underlying farmland increases indirectly from a cauliflower boom. Remember much of the value of a farm isn't necessarily from the crop it produces but the underlying dirt, the capability of production. Even if Gladstone doesn't convert to any cauliflower production, if a bunch of cauliflower produces start buying up land to produce cauliflower, it should indirectly bid up the value of Gladstone's assets as the supply of farmland decreases.I grow broccoli for a living in California and this post killed me....it's a fad

I'm betting long-term on $BYDN and %TYSN. Impossible Foods is privately held but $YUM may also be a good bet as well as $CAG if you want to cover production. something to consider is that the consumer market may not react well to lab-grown meat for a while, but that doesn't mean it can't be used in things like pet food and animal-based products such as makeup, hygiene  or skincare products as well.

Ok jokes asside investing in farms is kinda none existent as far as I've seen. Most farms are private, and a lot are family owned. Instead of buying stocks, maybe consider buying farmland if you have the money, and if you want to use it to farm to a lot of research and find someone who's actually well versed in agriculture. Don't do it unless you have a bit of fall back money, and can get a loan. Do note, farming will have a slow build up. It'll take time to get money back on the investment, but it'll make a lot later on.

But as for stocks, find places that sell the cauliflower or make cauliflower products.Honestly I was doing the KETO diet and cauliflower pizza was literally so good it tasted exactly the same, it’s expensive thoughCAULIFLOWER FUTURES HIT ALL TIME HIGHI would look for food companies that are producing a significant portion of the 'cauliflower foods' and invest in them.

Those kids would have made a lot of moneyTo be honest I though my friend was crazy when he said people ate kale regularly now. I was a 90s kid working fast food and the only thing I thought it was used for was as a garnish or decoration around food bars. I didn't think people actually ate it.And the funny thing is that its [all the same fucking plant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassica_oleracea).

We eat and grow a tonne where I’m from but don’t see demand increasing dramatically..Want to buy some cauliflower? I got myself a truckload when I heard the rumours.keto maybeketo diet.

My GF only eats pizza this way.   in fact we found a place close by that has this type of crust so she had pizze for the first time in years.

If you've ever heard of MOD pizza they let you choose cauliflower crust pizza for an extra $2. It's delicious and I get it every time. Much tastier than the thick, chewy doughGluten free pizza is higher in calories than traditional dough typically which are both really high. A slice of pizza is going to run you around 300 calories so for a normal female they could eat around 4 to 5 slices and be over calories for the full day. 

A cauliflower dough will be significantly less calories and much lower on carbohydrates which is what most people are trying to limit. Especially low fiber high carb foods like dough.Which is amazing 😃You ever hear about that start up Tesla?

AGM offers a near 5% dividend yield and has been achieving 10+% CAGR over the past decade. Their delinquency rate never even went above 0.1% even during the Great Recession. Their loans are as solid as they come. An added benefit is that the U.S. government has always subsidized farming and made sure that farmers can afford their loans/equipment/machinery and make a living because it's such an integral component of our economy.

"Always has been"Cauliflower pizza was ok.. I guess I could develop a taste for it if I wanted too. However, the nutritional info didn't seem to be that great so I thought it was probably better to having a smaller portion of a regular pizza than the overpriced cauliflower one.

I already got Covid so I'm immune to catching it or spreading it againWell, liquefied kale opens up a wealth of opportunities including vegetable broths, smoothies, sauces (especially with roasted pine nuts, olive oil, & garlic), and for use when making pasta (instead of water, use kale juice).Actually no, just an amazing opportunity lolThat's because it is, tried every damn version of the shit I can find at the grocery store and have even made my own.

My father is a medical professional and works in the Covid unit at a relatively well known hospital. He's told me they haven't seen anything other than anecdotal evidence that suggest you can catch it twice.You can get shipped away for war, but you can’t even have a beer or a cig.Sorry, but while your father is right in the short term, he is overall incorrect.   We know some can "catch it" twice, like every virus.  What we don't know is how many, and how long antibodies last in those that develop immunity.  It could be that antibodies last forever, or it could be that they only last something like 90 days.God bless americaBut this guys father who is a medical professional at *one* hospital says *he* hasn’t seen anything other than anecdotal evidence. You must be wrong

US is trying to pivot away but I am not sure if this is a long term trend.K
B can jxnby at thisPrevents them from selling and making profit without LICENSE (read corruption and mega corporation benefit).

Doesn't prevent cheap imports. 

Nice. Good logic.

Huawei 5G scandal was the reason for the bans on selling tech though. They routed data back to China. 

No one really cares about Xinjiang. If it was the case, Saudi would have got sanctions long ago for Yemen. 

Buuuuut then oil.Everyone knows about our war crimes, nothing is a secret. 
Most states don’t care about  small amounts of marijuana anymore. 
Trying to illegally cross a border should get you detained and sent back.
For every video of peaceful protestors getting attacked there’s a video of rioters attacking the police. Both sides have their bad seeds, you just don’t look for videos that don’t support your views.im waiting for the average reddit social justice anti china, xenophobic dickhead to chime in using their made in china iphone, wearing their HM clothing, and   complaining about why they have no choice.

Americans = hypocrites.Lmao the USA wants to talk about human rights. The pot calling the Kettle blackThe iPhone is made by a Taiwan company called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd. branded as Foxconn in factories located in east, south, and central mainland China, where there are rare Uighur people. So, where does this accusation come from?Good for AmericaSo are we gunna go through with this human right thing orrrrrrrrr profits....

"In 2019 the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, representing 57 Muslim countries, sent investigators to Xinjiang, China—they toured the vocation centres the US calls ‘concentration camps’ & found no abuses. Why doesn’t western media report this—the US doesn’t care about Muslims."Hmm. Guess US dollar just bought signed it own death certificate.Unfortunately you are an investor who uses logic and reason to determine the price and trajectory of a stock, and for that reason, I’m out.Sick burnThe market should go up when we cut ties with countries that steal intellectual property and manipulate their currency.  The market is actually getting more rational by not negatively reacting to this.  More sanctions on China please.If you assume interest rates will stay here for the long run, the stock market is actually at a reasonable valuationThe impact of the Chinese - US trade disruptions is hurting the US market more than China. One of the many reasons why investing in Europe over the US is in favor right now is that its economic outlook is better and not just due to the better pandemic handling, but because Europe will more economic benefit from the rebounding Chinese economy and consumer spending than the US, because of the US/Chinese friction.

For example, in the article “[Risks are mounting for U.S. stocks. Here’s where BlackRock says investors should look instead](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/risks-are-mounting-for-us-stocks-heres-where-investors-should-look-instead-says-blackrock-2020-07-20)“, it’s explained that Europe’s economy looks less risky than the US economy for reasons that include getting along with China:

> “Europe’s health capabilities and containment measures position the region well for a domestic recovery. European companies are also highly geared to an improvement in global trade and recovering Chinese economy,” global chief investment strategist Mike Pyle said.

My point is that we’re still seeing the negative impact of the hostilities vs. China but it’s showing up in the extra interest investors have developed to non-US stocks, which is one reason why Euro stocks are rising recently.

But I’m all in favor of the US and China decoupling. Global trading means US investors don’t have to invest in the US. We can invest in Europe, Asia or African markets if we wanted to. I think it’s a good thing for some countries to not be all in the same interconnected Web of economic risks. It makes erratic world leaders much more dangerous if we are all tightly coupled.

So even though I’m pointing out that the US is hurting itself more than it’s hurting China, I’m actually in support of decoupling.Saudis check inIf you are applying for Walmart job, it doesn't matter whether you have the resume or not as long as you are willing to work decently for minimum wageHuawei needs to be added to this list.

Ericsson and Nokia have entirely repurposed themselves to become the only 2 remaining 5G suppliers outside of Huawei.  Huawei is now being banned/legislated against across the globe.

Obviously do your own due diligence (blah, blah) but I’m long ERIC and NOK as of last Thursday.

Nothing like a duopoly suddenly appearing overnight and now we’ve got the chance to bid on it.Saudi Arabia isnt in the midst of a cold war with America.Cant mess with oil my dude. Lol.Hmm... dont think you can compare the 2.  Totally diff scales.Actually it is a quiet and particular war

Over a rock...called cesiumOf course they do, that's why the U.S has such a rocky relationship with Colombia, Brazil, Haiti, Saudi Arabia, Israel, UAE, Bahrain, Qatar, Jordan, Turkey, Morocco, Pakistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Equatorial Guinea, Rwanda, Chad, Cameroon etc...The US isn’t one person.It does care about scoring some points before an election"i blame the russians!"How much yuans does Winnie the Pooh pay you to simp for him?You’ll get banned if you’re political there and I have a feeling you were. Being against CCP is good but you’re in the wrong neighborhood discussing it. Nobody gives a rats ass if you support and what you oppose there. Social justice warriors have always gotten banned there, rightfully so. 

They’re there to learn and read about economicsThey have been for a long time.Show prove? seems like a stretch to say I got banned for saying "what the CCP is doing is bad".

No wonder you got banned, spouting cold war era propaganda in a forum that has nothing to do with that topic.Reddit is partially owned by CCP they literally funded them with 150 mill.Wow. I took a look over there just nkw, glad I'm staying unsubscribed from there. They feel so reactionary over there. Not saying other places are better but if you compare here and there, it's night and day.As a Chinese bot, thanks. It’s nice to be noticed.There were always Chinese bots in all comment sections.As opposed to all the other countries out there where people are literally rounded up for wrong think and thrown in work camps. There is no perfect country. The good thing about this country is that you are free to leave. But you won’t.China has concentration camps and harvests organs from prisoners.  The Internet is entirely censored to the point that if you were in China, you would not even be able to write the message you just wrote because Reddit is banned. 
 Stop with the false equivalency.Aren't they all? who you think gives a shit about you? not coming after you but nobody cares about you really but yourself, sure you can have people who care but not the same way you care for yourself. maybe not everyone but most people at leastYea when systematic cultural genocide and labor camps featuring forced organ transplants=" any excuse they can find" that's when you know you gor your priorities right. US evil, capitalism bad wah wah wah socialism good me smart reddit yayHey now! I resemble that remark!I think you'd have to hold a rather extreme hardline against China to be considered xenophobic these days lmaoWell objectively speaking the U.S does fucked up things and continues to do so, has the U.S at any point had 3 million ethnic people in imprisonment camps?I’m laughing at this being downvoted bc ppl want to turn it into a contest of who is the most oppressed😂You’re comparing apples to oranges. Yes, the US has issues...but let’s not equate them to what goes on in China.  It’s time for the US to look elsewhere in the region for its outsourcing.  Perhaps Vietnam.  That’s the only way the US can truly punish China. The tariffs don’t do it and the Chinese laugh at them.  Take away all those jobs and give them to a neighboring country, that will wipe the smile off their facesIt sounds so good when you say this stuff on the internet, but you should learn the difference, there’s no comparisonLike this market cares about something as trivial as profits.That's like getting a state-sponsored tour of North Korea.  Westerners in China are not allowed to go to Xinjiang right now.  Why is that?  They need to be prepared ahead of time to put on a show for you.Well to be honest, many if not most Middle Eastern nations are not really glowing examples of protectors of human rights. Many of the nations in that group commit just as horrible atricities against their own people.Who would criticize China on human rights and incur their economic and diplomatic coercion? OIC countries love their Chinese market just like everyone else. If that requires throwing Uighurs under the bus, so be it.Because Western media is owned and controlled by China, smart one.Going to be a big no from me too dog.Is this a letterkenny reference by chance?The CCP is worse then Enron....Those companies willingly gave away their "intellectual property" for a piece of China's market.Agreed with all but manipulating currency . Seems to me all major powers can be blamed for doing so . Like fed going brrr to chinese going chichingLooool yeah cuz everyone plays by the booksNo offense, but look at USA now.  t's six of one, half a dozen of the other.That’s not how productivity or gdp works, China provides cheap products and basically infinite cheap labor, there is literally 0 reason that reducing ties with them is a positive for the market. Don’t try to act like companies don’t benefit from chjna when they have been milking what is basically slave labor for decades. From a human rights perspective this is good but under NO circumstance is this beneficial for trade or the companies that make up the stock market, saying otherwise is just lyingWant world economic collapse? 
Want countries to ignore USA and it's bs sanctions just because they have to survive?

Want world war 3? 

That's what you'll get for statements about sanctioning the world factory. 

There are no alternatives to Chinese cheap shit for poor countries like mine. We dony want to buy, but are forced to.And you have to admit even with low rates trading 30×s value is not right. Hell tesla grew the size of Ford's market share in 1 day! I guess I am old school...We all know they are not moving!

Why don't you put your money where your mouth is and switch to Euro stocks?The Saudis are checking in on the drop of the dollar wondering how far it will go..92/93.. But hey.. Who Do you think bought all that gold and silver today! LolYep.   I have seen so many products on amazon that I buy and then find out sucks but when I go to leave a review the product no longer exists.  Mostly cheap shit anyway but it’s annoying as hell.Wait how tf isn’t Huawei on the list. They should be the first ones.Dont forgt about American Tower (AMT) which is a reit stock that invest in cell towers. they are doing 5g as well. It's worth checking out.I'm long NOK too. I bought a call on ERIC last week and sold it for a 60% profit on Friday after their earnings. I'm probably gonna buy some shares since I am bullish on them, but the gap from earnings makes me nervous, so I'll probably wait another week or so to see if it fills it. I also might consider options at that point. I'm new to trading/investing, so this is my first earnings season and I don't really know what to expect. This is also such a unique time that even experienced investors know what's gonna happen with any certainty.Huawei has a ton of sanctions on it now....

And is it ericsson and nokia? ...thought there were more suppliers including American ones.Ciena tooIf you had to pick between NOK and ERIC, which one would you choose?Huawei is private company so no effect on stock market until they decide to go public.I'm guessing you are benefiting from the USA being the top and only fuckard country in the world.ExactlyArguableWell... at the moment anyway. The next 30 years are going to be wild.They literally cut journalist into pieces using a Chainsaw...I mean one has significantly more people to oppress that's trueCare to expand? What's cesium good for?[deleted]Instead it's a single capitalistic entity, which again, doesn't care about human rights.Neither is China... you're not as smart as you think.Oh shit, really?!?!?Why?Probably 50 centsHow much trump dick do you suck so 140k Americans can die?[deleted]You’re clearly an idiot, head on over there where they constantly talk about Trump and politics but ban any mention of communism.

Tell that to the people of East Timor and El Salvador.Amerikkka has concentration camps tooEver heard of a VPN?do you have articles by any chance or any sorts of proof ?I don't care man, I just want China trade to stop completely. Enough is enoughits the same effect that trump had on actual racists and closet racists coming out.

The US literally assassinated a foreign politician on foreign soil.

Russia did the same thing.

Where is the uproar against that?There’s hundreds of US companies using the these slaves which just adds to the problem. The US is just doing this for their image they don’t really give a shit.3 million? I thought it was 4 million.They murdered like 2 million innocent people in the Vietnam war not to mention the other almost 2 million Iraqi deaths from the Iraq war¯\_(ツ)_/¯I guess according to you locking kids in cages doesn't count, or do you not think of them as people in the first place.Only [112,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_Japanese_Americans) but I mean, if we had 3,000,000 at the time we certainly would have locked them up. It's the exact same thing, the fact that we didn't have as many minorities to lock up doesn't make it "better" in any sense.I think you are forgetting the prisoners of the  Japanese exclusion Camps, the migrants being detained at the border and 400 years of slavery, and exterminating the native Americans.The country which made Native American camps that Hitler learned from to make Nazi concentration camps?That's right, let's not equate education with bombs.Yea  finally some one who gets it right , USA is much worst at human rightsShark Tank.Sounds like Barbara from shark tankI believe an American Idol reference.Were you trading during the Enron and WorldCom scandals?

Edit to say: China is not worse than them.China hasn't been the "cheap labor" source for manufacturers for a while now. Maybe for high tech. But for apparel industry countries like Vietnam, Bangladesh Sri Lanka are the preferred suppliers now.

A lot of the factories in China relocated to these countries as soon as the trade war started, circumventing sanctionsLet’s get slave labour from somewhere else. Somewhere which isn’t a massive threat to our liberties and somewhere which isn’t a totalitarian fascist shithole

Yea, I know what I’m saying is fucked up, but China 8s even more fucked up and way too dangerous to rely onChina might provide cheap labor but Mexico is even cheaper and they are our neighbor.I can't believe you're getting downvoted while the person you're replying to is upvoted.

No wonder r/stocks is a horrible place to get advice.Way to generalize people from a few words and project. Firstly, I don’t have a lifelong opinion of favoring European stocks. I have a second-half of 2020 opinion of favoring European stocks. Secondly, I do own European stocks. I have no US stocks right now unless they are global/multinational companies with strong ex-US businessSounds like you're searching back 10 pages for newly listed items if you're buying products and within weeks they are no longer listed. I don't think I've ever had that issue. If you buy something that has been on the site longer than a month, it's probably not going to disappear the week you buy it.Must've been the only one able to afford the bribeElon gonna make it worthlessThank you!  I swear we’ve got a REIT/ETF for just about anything these days, very coolI think you made a good choice.  

There aren’t any right answers.  You can throw darts and beat months’ worth of analysis.

That being said though, the market is a reverse-casino.  It’s one of the few games we have where the odds are in the player’s favor.  I am comfortable with risk, so I have some calls on Nokia for 2022.

Personally, I think both ERIC and NOK will see moderate growth.  In 5 years, one will emerge as a clear leader I am hoping, barring a return of Huawei.  I don’t think the CPC is going to take it’s greasy fingers out of Huawei anytime soon.No sir.  The American telecom companies are partnering with both Ericsson and Nokia to bid on contracting out waves of towers that are built each year.It depends on your timeframe.

I’m 23 so time doesn’t matter much - I’m looking at Ericsson to be better % profit but Nokia being a cheaper long position with exponential gain potential.

Nokia has a fuckload of employees still, primarily in Finland.  Don’t quote me, but I believe it’s 100,000+ people.  I really love companies that have the balls to reinvent themselves like Nokia did.It has a massive effect on the price of their competitors though, especially in what is now going to be a duopoly pending the ban on Huawei.Not quite sure what you mean here.No they’re not.And China is genociding Uyghurs Holocaust-style... both are bad. One is far worse.

Edit: how the fuck is this comment controversial?LolSaudis is some backwards medieval society, but I don't think they harvest organs from their own citizens.Cesium is the most radioactive element per the periodic table

It can pass data at mind boggling speeds. And it is absolutely vital for the 5g pushLol, I just went through geography in my head and I guess I counted them twice. They are probably deserving of such a dubious honor of being double counted for their human rights abuses.Everything you enjoy in life is thanks to capitalismI mean, I agree Trump doesn’t actually care.lolCommunism is a political theory and capitalism is an economic theory you imbecile...

i  need location , if you know anyone that works there. you can pm if you feel more comfortable. your name will not be include in anything 

am serious thats a big statement to make, knowing very well what a concentration camp is.I was in China in 2018 and it is incredibly difficult to download and subscribe to a VPN unless you set it up beforehand.  Even then, the servers are constantly blocked and the connection is terrible.  A VPN is not a solution to censorship, especially when 99% of Chinese people don't know what the fuck a VPN is or why they would need one.  An already brainwashed person does not see the need for a VPN.  They love their censored Internet.  They think the government is protecting them from foreign influence.Agreedhighly agreed but are you making sure your items don't say made in china? 
you need to hit them where it hurts. 


JIC.. I don't  support chinese made products because of the environmental issues that cheap made stuff end up doing, also avoid single use plastic like the plague.there is literally video evidence circulating of china committing genocide my dude.

and you are on reddit complaining that people are being xenophobic against china...Please link resources and proof that these companies are doing this,so we can expose them and end that if they are indeed doing as you say they are, I find it hard to believe hundreds of U.S companies are doing this and overall what you insinuated is rather vague, but I’m sure you have links to specific proof of U.S companies using Uighur slave labor.the US has 4 million in imprisonment camps?!?!?!? /sThat is a separate set of circumstance in regards to humanitarian crisis and wartime law, this is an unfair parallel to make and takes away from the intrinsic tragedy of all three separate issues. Like a said the U.S has done fucked yo things and continues to do fucked up things, I myself as an American citizen can see that in the history books and find a vast majority o like minded people who agree with that America is 80% evil, the percent good that it consists of is the ability for informed people who aren’t subsumed by rhetoric legislative foolery to address and attempt to change said evils and mistakes. I have not had any such positive interactions with Ethnic Han Chinese people on reddit who are very nationalist and never address the issue of what their government who they passionately support, are doing to the Uighur population. Which I find appalling and very disheartening, what I also found disheartening was that you completely ignored the Uighur situation and tried to equate an ongoing mass tragedy of, forced abortions, forced sterilization, forced labor, ethnic cleansing and many other horrible things, that are ongoing, 3,000,000 + people think about that number and come back to me, with something that isn’t rhetoric.I never mentioned anything about the atrocious human rights violation of the ice detention facilities, that we American public have to change and make sure that shit ends, I sign my fair share of petitions and make donations to platforms that are working with lobbyists and legislative leaders to reform and end the ice facilities and Bi laws. I don’t see any way Chinese citizens can do that or are willing to do that, I think you fundamentally misunderstand the point I’m trying to make here.If China releases them, apologies, admits its racism, makes racial discrimination illegal, and pays 3.4 billion (inflation adjusted)....**then** it will be almost the same thing.  Except I see no indication of forced labor in the US camps.I mean we could go back in history and look at atrocities that almost all countries have committed... I do think much of the world has a moral high ground over what China is doing in 2020.We have not been a country for 400 years. Not even 300 years. We ain't perfect but at least I know my shit stinks.Of course, I’m not forgetting that, but I don’t need to take history into account when you already have, my point being is that, in today’s information sharing age, don’t you think that your efforts would be better put to being concerned that actively more than 3 million Uighurs are in detention camps, inhumanly treated and have no voice. I understand the reasoning and the anger you feel towards me for making that comment, which made you bring up multiple parallels from the past but not from the present, I think that’s part of the problem. You tried to correlate history with a current human rights nightmare that a country is committing with the support and or at the bare minimum, “going along with” of its own citizens. This is wrong and evil and I’ll parallel it with what hitler did to the Jewish people.Hitler learnt from the Americans? No. He experimented a lot. It was pure innovation. 

Probably learnt from the Brits and their Boer concentration camps though. 

Brit empire was the OG villian I tell ya.This level of wokeness is so out there it should be the main viewpoint on all the mainstream news station.

Oops.  to late.How many people immigrate to China for a better life?The dragons den!Ah, letterkenny referenced shark tank I guess! No need for the downvote. Just a question.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YG46tFtxeGk

There's the reference if you're interested. There's a couple bits where he says "And for that reason, I'm out"

So Revisiting this episode it's definitely a shark tank parodyThat's Mark Cuban's lineWhat gave it away dawg?Theft of money only does so much damage, compared to the CCP who runs body farms. (The PG-13 way to put it.)  Xi Jinping is the Adolf Hitler of our generation, I would even go as far to say that he is in someways worse and by all metrics far more dangerous then Hitler. 

I am just getting started in my trading journey yes, but when that hell spawn dies I will sleep better at night. I started tracking COVID-19 in mid-December, not much sticks with me but the horrible shit that came out of Wuhan took something out of me. (Wont post here on reddit about some of the things they did mostly TOS related some to keep little pink from seeing my cards.) 

With out getting too political or rambling on longer then need be. We are living in world war three with the CCP, not enough people realize that. Regardless if this war is fought with debt traps, theft of intellectual property, or even wielding a one to a trillion opportunity as a biological weapon. They are attacking us and we are too deaf and blind to see it. Xi Jingping truly has perfected the art of war, by many metrics. Here is hoping a equal counter move can be made with out shit spiraling out of control.

Didn't mean to project on you like that, just some bad shit going on in China. If I become a billionare I will fight Xi Jinping and the rest of the CCP till they are no longer in power or I am dead. That rant escalated quickly.....High tech is like 45% of the market, I mean I agree but my original point still stands, Chinese relations worsening shouldn’t result in a stock market riseInjustice anywhere is injustice everywhere. You sir, are a dickMexico can't even put a car together, you want them to assemble microchips?  

That's not even going into employees not showing up after paydays.  Friend/neighbor of mine had a factory in Mexico and he would tell me stories.  Would not recommend setting up shop there.  That friend had to move, because he went bk.That’s pretty much how this subreddit goes, they think if I don’t like China then China must be bad for the economy. Meanwhile in reality Taiwan semis makes the dies for every major tech company, China has over half of the rare earth metals on the market, we have for the past like 50 years had companies shift their infrastructure there for the cheap labor and rely on China for a literal majority of our production. But hey according to r/stocks a fight with China should somehow make the market go up because China=badGood luck with that. Report back in 2021.I could be off on the time frame a bit.  I usually don’t go past 4 pages because I would be in the new product range that has not been tested or fake reviewed up.   It’s just a trash Chinese import platform anyway.Lmao, so realCould you elaborate pleaseOwning stocks is +EV

Betting on stocks, not so muchOkay. Nice.I'm around the same age as you. I've moved from Nokia to Ericsson after a long deliberation. I just can't see Nokia moving that much, especially compared to Ericsson.

I split my NOK position evenly to ERIC and NET and I feel much more content this way. I'll still keep an eye on NOK but I'm not feeling it.Ahh, it’s not cold?Because it at best lacks supporting evidence, and at worst, is completely and totally factually incorrect.Lots of CCP bots in here (Reddit) voting anything anti CCP.They do blend journalistsThat’s like comparing apples to slightly smaller applesThey behead people in broad daylight my broddaHow the hell is cesium involved in 5G. 

Are those towers radioactive.why do people want 5g anyways?What's cesium used to build?Thank you capitalism for food, sex and sunsetsSo untrue lmao[deleted]They got exposed many months ago for deleting those pics. I believe they finally gave in and stopped doing it there after being called out for censoring itProbably no conc camps. 

But don't need conc camps with 8 Battle fleets....and a few 100 bases, 

Countries are good conc camps once you're powerful enough. 

What does a conc camp do? Limit people's right to move and work. (Sanctions), and then exploit them slowly (resource theft via corporations), and kill some choicy people (moderate rebels, drone strikes, proxy warlords, irresponsible mercenary etc etc).[deleted]They’re called ICE Detention Centers.>They love their censored Internet.

This is sort of a problem everywhere now. Here in the US, most people are in an echo chamber. I know it's different since they aren't forced into it, but companies like Facebook and Alphabet definitely push it. This makes changing someone's view, and personal growth of viewpoints, damn near impossible and only adds to the public divide.Have you heard any organ harvest during your time thereSo youre saying it is possible to get on Reddit on a VPN if I wanted to. So its not banned. Got it.ok so heres where your bias exists.

You have an unknown sourced video, unverified, providing you with a narrative that you believe without even questioning its authenticity?

heres what I know

1) the US has a conflict with china

2) the US does use propaganda

3) it wouldnt be the first time its done underhanded shit to destabilize a nation.Here you guys you snarky cunt lol. You think this one links will take them down, go ahead Superman. https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/02/apple-foxconn-and-81-others-are-accused-of-using-uighur-forced-labor/It's different, but in a similar vein, prison labor here is essentially slave labor. Hopefully there's some reform with that in the near future, but unfortunately the for profit prisons are huge lobbyists so I doubt it'll change any time soon.Oh. Then it should be 5 million in Xinjiang camps. 

Hmmm ... Let's round it up to 10 million instead.You have not had positive interaction with a Chinese person, maybe that's your damn problem. Are Americans the only ones allowed to be ultra nationalistic. 

Besides the ones on reddit probably don't represent China in general. 

Also normal Chinese can't access the internet or YouTube or Facebook and communicate with globalised culture in general, so how can you expect unbiased views. 

As for the Uighurs.. that is an issue but will lead to ultimate Muslim integration in Chinese society which is pretty damn good for both them and for China. Tibet is already mostly integrated. Its developing fast. 

Xinjiang is a region with violence and terrorism. Integration solves stuff. Everyone would like to get along. 

Its not as if China does not do this with other citizens. It steam rolls every internal opposition remember? 

No double standards here. They're downright ugly in every case. Hong Kong. Xinjiang. Tiananmen. Muslim Christian Han Turk. They don't give a shit.

That's their way. 

USA however has double standards a plenty.

It is fighting wars in Afghan, Iraq Iran and how many other places in the middle East now? How many civilians have died. 

Yemen and Saudi atrocities?

I'd choose USA over China as world police any day don't get me wrong.

But y'all do a lot of stuff. Its like how cops are not liked. 

You're the world cop. 

But thanks for your service I guess.Damn way to generalize whole ethnicity you asshole on Reddit nonetheless. what do you expect from a keyboard warrior ? I suggest you walk outside  and try to understand other people perspective than hide in your incel basement jacking off>apologies, admits its racism, makes racial discrimination illegal, and pays 3.4 billion (inflation adjusted)

As if this makes up for anything. The JA internment camps were a government coup supported by the CA's farmer's association to seize private property and farm land under the guise of "national security." And each person got $10k back then, which is still a slap in the wrist considering many lost land that had been in their family for generations and were a big part of their livelihood.

Also, it's ridiculous, but when has China ever been seen as the pillar of human rights? This is par for the course with them; it's disgusting. But the US is no better.I think the USA should give back south west of America back to Mexico plus half of USA to native Americans , Hawaii and puerto rico back and apologize .than pay 10 billion dollars with interest to the groups and maybe than USA can talk .Ok I think me and you can agree that if you looked into the history of the world those are all tragedies that we don’t want repeated? What I don’t understand is regardless of moral high ground it seems you are giving  an excuse for the Chinese central government to intern 3,000,000+ ethnic people on ground of their ethnicity alone, am I wrong?I think that is your own patriotic perception . The USA Is no better than China . We just do
It under the guise of democracy. I think you need touch up on your history and be less bias / racistThe USA is no better than China , stop regurgitating the anti China narrative because it’s gets you karma .We as Americans need to step down from our pedestal because we ain’t that great . We have and are still fucking up a lot of lives plus the whole Iraq war situation where we basically destroyed lives of tens of millions of people because we were looking for imaginary WMDs.  Don’t even get me started with the Vietnam invasion that resulted with nothing but the deaths of millions viets and USA soldiersThere’s some that do. 

How many Chinese people get treated like shit in the states? Many, maybe all of them.Here's another downvote for ya. Reddit powerrrrrrrI understand and very much appreciate your rage. 

China didn't cause every employee and investor to lose their money - often life savings.

I suppose it's a different version of human suckitude but it still sucks.The only dick here is the one who would doom a demographic to indefinite slavery and the inability to think for themselves and say what they want without fear of imprisonment.I am having good luck with it. i’m beating NDAQ.

All the stocks you can buy on US exchanges have their equivalents in other markets that are doing better because their countries economies have better fundamentals right now. BABA, China’s e-commerce giant, has had about the same stock performance as Amazon, only its customers aren’t dependent on its government socializing failure, which is ironic if you think about it because China’s the communist country. SAP is a German software giant, and it doesn’t rely on monopoly practices like US software makers, that they’re under scrutiny in the EU for engaging in. There’s nothing wrong with ex-US stocks. 

And the days when stimulus only lifted US stocks and left other countries’ stocks behind are gone.With magic satellite internet 

But probably not really, but maybe: I sold most of my AMT. 

giving up on real estate, something else Elon might ruin with his self driving cars and rocketsTake your semantics to someone who cares.I am split fairly evenly between both with a slight preference to NokiaI downvoted him, because what he’s saying is bullshit. CCP is awful in their own way and so is Saudi Arabia. One is genociding Uyghurs, exploiting cheap labor and censoring just about everything etc. and the other one is genociding Yemenis, financing terrorism, oppressing more than half of their own population and it’s not too far fetched to say they are enslaving cheap foreign labour etc. Both regimes are terrible. The only real difference is that US is not threatened by Saudis, while China is challenging US world dominance.Nah, it's because OP is wrong.

"Holocaust-style" means death camps.

The Chinese are not killing Uyghurs. They are trying to assimilate them like [Canadian Indian residential school system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Indian_residential_school_system).

That's still a type of genocide, but not the Holocaust kind.\*Enjoy our freshly made journalist smoothie, made from the various pieces of someone who didn't know when to "not" see something\*

Eeeh.Story is murky.Lmaohttps://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a23300/cesium-alkali-metal-define-second-burst-into-flames/Its not retail 5g for cell phones that they are concerned with

It is military grade equipment. Satellites 
Anything that communicates, feel me?

So if the chinese push to get a 5g network and we dont have cesium to follow suit, we lose.

Bad. Among other concerns but this is perhaps the most criticalSpectrum efficiency and throughput improvements.  
  
It is simply the next round of wireless tech and brings broadband speeds to fixed and mobile terminals all over the world cheaply because you just need fibre from a POP to a tower and then 5G devices. No more Comcast Monopoly, no more homes with copper phone lines, plebs crying into their ADSL modem.  
  
5G is just a tangent on the curve of human progress. It is a manifestation of our growing standard of living and it just what is happening in Telecommunications at the moment.  
  
I think that free-to-air TV spectrum will get repurposed at some point because everything is going on-line on-demand.Fast speedMany things

You have to research it. Im not an expert on it but i was exposed to it from an investing standpoint via the markets.

I know that atomic clocks, the most precise clock man has, absolutely require it.For food sure.I was replying to that person who is subbed to numerous virtual reality subs. Why would you reply to a comment that wasn’t addressed to you and then say it’s not relevant to your personal life? How does that make any sort of sense?Im pretty sure Ive only replied to 2 comments. Unless you are double posting under another username, which is pretty pathetic. That aside --

>where they constantly talk about Trump and politics but ban any mention of communism. It’s a double standard. You’re letting your biases get in the way.

First of all, I don't like Trump. At all. Im not biased in whatever way you think I am. I don't regularly go to that subreddit, so I have no clue whether or not they talk about Trump or not.

>Ahh, says the person with a post history...

Irrelevant. My post history has nothing to do with the topic at hand. You're wrong and this is your way of trying to discredit me. Typical bullshit, avoid facts and cling to speculation.

>You’re definitely not an angry Communist

Im against American/Russian/Chinese propaganda, aka Im against bullshit. If there isn't actual evidence, or I am not aware of the evidence, then I dont behave as if it's true. The reality is that the American government lies about the CCP and Russia. The CCP and Russia lie and do their own shady activities as well.

I think its stupid to talk socio-political, especially world politics, in a subreddit about economics. I mean, maybe if you made a post about communism as an economic theory... but that topic is kind of dead these days. Im not aware of any real communist economies. Its all some combination of capitalism and socialism.so humor me a little and define them if you can.

just so am clear prolife and prochoice are equal grounds or not ?your not really comparing a concentration camp to the ice detention center dude


what is a concentration camp if you had to define it?Duck duck go! Fuck Google!Very true..very true.[deleted]not what they said....but sure sir.Dude you're at tin foil hat level of craziness right now.Bro its fucking China... You literally look like a paid CCP shill XD

The concentration camps have been verified to exist by Egyptian muslims who have managed to flee capture and were stalked by the CCP in foreign nations.

Thirdly, they single handedly unleashed a worldwide pandemic slaying people in the thousands daily and have yet to even say "sorry".Lmao. You're as bad as trump supporter conspiracy theorists who make shit up to defend him.I assumed you downvoted me, that is a media piece accusing 81 companies of directly or indirectly profiting from Uighur labor, I want to see better research ad more substantial proof than just one article. You are angry over me asking for proof and called me a snarky cunt for pursuing something that you brought up. Which is a shame because I’m glad to learn about different pieces of information.You’re ignoring the point I’m trying to make I have nothing against the Chinese people, I have something against 3 million people in camps and reading what you said you’re okay with it and you continue to give me rhetoric and justification in some ways for it too.Lmao dude you are a troll, trolling a tragedy.But can’t you understand there is a difference between something being done **right now** vs something done almost 100 years ago?  If china wants to go back in time and sanction us in the past, that is fine.Yes we agree, and no that was not my intention. I am very against the current Chinese regime and all the horrible things they’re doingAnti Chinese narrative, my response to that is it comes from a place of anti, anti humanitarian crisis, I didn’t list anything in the hopes of karma or even thought about karma. What I said wasn’t anti Chinese in the least it was like I said anti crimes against humanity, you can say I can’t say anything because of the mistakes of the past, *sins of the father* am I right? But if I don’t make this point about 3,000,000+ people in reformation camps, that’s wrong objectively speaking once you’re away from a political agenda and you stand with what is massively fucked and super massively fucked, which what the CCP is doing to the Uighur’s is it’s not an anti Chinese or anti American or anti ant country sentiment at all its anti “three million people in a prison camp with no voice”. The fact that people are missing the point and are making this political and not humanitarian is quite sad and disheartening.And another thing you’re entire profile is dedicated towards attacking comments like these, directed in any form towards the CCP, any can take a quick breeze through your comment section and see proof of that. You are nothing but an enabler and apologist, your entire profile is solely responses to comments, nothing else.If your a real person I can’t believe you exist.Risk is what comes with the market, it sucks but we know this going in. I agree that what they did was wrong and horrible, however did the entire bored minus two get sued for everything almost? (One got out early the other committed suicide.)No, youre a dick my man. Point blankI personally don’t see Starlink taking over contemporary internet in urban areas. SatNet  simply cannot compete with local receivers when we’re looking at concrete-heavy locations.

Now, suburbs and rural areas? Fuck yeah there’s going to be some competition there. If by some magical fucking insanity Starlink gets the same up/down as wired internet, it might pull a lot of gamers over as wellR/Investing?  It’s not like this is r/web, we aren’t *trying* to lose here.

There are structural reasons why buying stocks is productive and rewarded and why gambling on options is expensive.okay i understand that but why do people always want more and more... its kinda my question 4g is fast enough... maybe make free wifi a thing so we don't even need cellphone signals in the air anymore...Do you think all those signals in the air are fucking with us?but things are fast enough, faster isn't always better.Sites where the mass detention of civilians without trial takes place.what do you use for email?Eh. Any country with ultra nationalism like USA, China, Russia, India and UK has these zombies. Would drone strike children if given the chance.Nah, I was commenting the original post because I visit china for tourism and I want to check reddit for content back home. Not whatever he replied to me. He took it way too out of context.found the racist.ok buds.

i guess the bay of pigs never happened.Ay US Prison labour camps. Pretty cool work for cents and the right to buy tampons.Your delusional, your argument is basically America can do no wrong . You are a example of a ignorant person>But can’t you understand there is a difference between something being done right now vs something done almost 100 years ago?

I mean I can; one, it wasn't almost 100 years ago. Two, my ultimate point is Americans get off on the idea that they're morally superior compared to China given the atrocities that China is committing right now and how akin they are are to the Nazi extermination of the Jewish people. This is what we've been taught, but just looking into the US' involvement in the past 20 years as the 'world police' doesn't shine a great light on the US, given the atrocities they've also committed against humanity. Saying it was almost 100 years ago doesn't also take into consideration the past 20, 40 years of wartime conflict we've been engaged in, and ultimately, for what?

And I'm not saying China deserves a pass, but I'm pretty sick of seeing the frequent comments on this sub saying "oh but we're better than China." One, that's a ridiculously low bar to set. And two, ultimately, we're not; Americans are just blind to what's going out outside of their bubble and have been fed information framed in a way that skews their perception.> Well objectively speaking the U.S does fucked up things and continues to do so, has the U.S **at any point** had 3 million ethnic people in imprisonment camps?

To summarize,

> "The United States NEVER did something like that"

> "Ok but when we did it we made it right"

> "Ok we didn't make it right, but that was a long time ago"

Put the goalposts back when you're done pleaseI appreciate your poultice and honest and human response, thank you.Probably paid CCP guy then. Lots of those. CCP likes to pay people for internet duty.I don’t exist bb but damn I didn’t know there were still geriatric fucks who still listen to Howard sternA documentary called, "Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room" was released in 2005 and it's fascinating.

You're right - risk comes with the market and we all accept that risk. This wasn't simply risk - it was outright fraud that affected many, many people. Employees, investors, other market segments...  It was a BFD.

There were some lawsuits but most employees and investors lost everything they had. I traded then, too, and lived in Houston. 

I thought the documentary would be super boring but it was anything but. It was extraordinarily well-done. 

Be safe out there.How rudeIt’s not whether or not he will replace them all. It’s whether or not the asset is over or under valued right now.

More relevant, what impact does 5g have on this?Dude, Elon is gonna turn us into borg. You wanna be a slow cyborg on dial up or be in everyone’s head like a giant brain?There are safety considerations with electromagnetic (EM) radiation.  Visible light, radiowaves, x-rays, etc are some of the bands on the complete spectrum of frequencies.  
   
[There are ionising and non-ionising bands as per this chart.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/375/cpsprodpb/2682/production/_107885890_5ggraphic-nc.png)  
  
For ionising radiation like x-rays we have to limit exposure because it is harming our cells' dna. For non-ionising radiation we have to limit exposure because body tissue heats up when it absorbs them.  
  
Consider sunlight, which is a broad band of EM. We can feel infrared heating us up but we can't feel the UV burning us.  
  
Well, [5G is going to use frequencies up to about 100GHz](https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/30805-50906-An-illustration-of-the-areas-of-spectrum-5G-could-operate-within-via-Qualcomm-xl.jpg) which is much lower frequency band than sunlight and is not ionising radiation.  
  
5G is actually using microwaves so you know it can cook your flesh, except the power output of your phone's radio is kept well under the safe limits. The phone towers are a higher power output but the inverse square law means the receive level is quite low by the time it gets to you, and because of the number of mobile users, 5G towers and 4G towers are very close together transmitting on low power because that gives a cleaner signal and more data throughput.  
  
Finally I will quote the safe limit of 100GHz microwave output. [This NIH page mentions 10 Watts per square meter and 0.08 Watts per Kg.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6765906/) A 5G phone will never get anywhere near that and the tower signal will be received by the antenna at about 0.0000001 Watts  and I would guess that your body would absorb about 1 milliWatt max from the tower. 
  
So because we have blood and sweat cooling us down, the tiny bit of heat is no issue. We're talking milliwatts total, compared to   sunlight which is about 1000W of radiation per square meter and some of that is ionising, unlike 5G. And even sunlight isn't too bad in moderation but 5G is fine as a low level background signal. Actually if you look on a spectrum analyser... there is a noise floor at 100GHz with signals here and there anyway.  
  
I hope that puts it into perspective... 5G is basically low power warm radiation and doesn't modify DNA (doesn't cause cancer). And it can't cook you because the power output is low, like TV and FM signals. It is like TV and radio signals but a higher band and with a much more efficient modulation scheme for data throughput.

Dictionary

con·cen·tra·tion camp

/ˌkänsənˈtrāSHən ˈˌkamp/

noun

a place where large numbers of people, especially political prisoners or members of persecuted minorities, are deliberately imprisoned in a relatively small area with inadequate facilities, sometimes to provide forced labor or to await mass execution. The term is most strongly associated with the several hundred camps established by the Nazis in Germany and occupied Europe in 1933–45, among the most infamous being Dachau, Belsen, and Auschwitz.

To say it is completely banned is false. I've been on reddit many many times during my time in china via VPN.according to americans and racists it isthats how you brush shit off?

if thats a whataboutism , why does reddit get a hard on for tiananmen square ? because its only 30 years ago?

how you people sleep at night with all this mental gymnasitcs and white is right savior type bullshit...man you guys must be living in lalaland.

What about the lynching and slavery? is that a whataboutism too?

geez.I'm actually opposed to ethnic internment camps in general. I'm just calling you out because you said the US has never done something similar. It's possible for two governments to do bad things.ah okay makes more sense now thanks.
I do have a question tho, why should you need a vpn to access something online ? 

what are they scared of?Bottom line is that you think genocide is okay so long as other countries did bad stuff at some point too. You're a sick person.They're scared their people will get influenced by global culture and demand change etc. Probably.Like he said, most don't use a VPN but services are provided because there are demand for certain customers, foreigners mostly. But VPNs crackdown do exist, mostly for censorship reasons, etc.lol if thats what you get from this, i really wish your mom swallowed or your dad let it go threw away the condom.

you are a hypocrite and the worst kind.For the better!cool thanksAll you have to do is agree that the genocide they are committing is wrong and you can't do it.Yup.
no shit genocide is wrong.

there is no proven or verified genocide of anything. you have a bunch of people in prison and being told by some source they are w.e group.

you dont even know if the sources youre reading has an agenda or narrative ti push.

imagine if images from guantanamo bay started getting passed around and some source claimed they were all muslim americans.

would you believe it? or would you question it?

your response to that determines whether you have prejudice or not.

aside from that, look what america did to the japanese americans, natives, black americans.

this just sends the message that america can do w.e it wants ,but when other countries do it, its wrong.

the US assassinated a politician on foreign soil.with a missile. imagine if any other foreign nation did that.

there fact that there is no  oversight for the US and that everyone just trusts the intel from it is an issue itself ..but wheres the criticisms there?I question everything America does, but it looks like you question nothing china does.

EDIT: First time I’ve ever received an award on reddit, actually first award ever, I am honored.In some good news... It looks like AMD is leaving that resistance line behind.

“SEA OF RED, STAY STRONG FOLKS”

HahahahaInstead of panicking about money lost, I'm panicking about whether to buy more during today's little dip or wait till Monday.

But hey, as long as we're panicking, SELL EVERYTHING!Going to try my best to just not look today. Bought apple yesterday when I thought it bottomed out at $370 but looks like it continued to fall overnight.

Emotions blur logic, I'm choosing to not watch for for nowProblem is... A LOT of people don't believe in their stocks.To me, 3 days of red is hardly a sale after a month of green, imho.I hope it drops more so I can buy moreI got paid today and it's the 2nd day of a niiice pullback.

This is like Christmas to meI'm actually happy it's red today. Been holding on to some cash, so now might be the right time to buy some stocks!stay strong...just buy more buy more.

time to be greeedyyyyyyMe looking at my 390 aapl call now worth .01

Hmm, I think I'll holdWhen should I buy in to take advantage?
Monday morning or sometime today??I don't understand people panicking right now. So some stock dropped a few percent recently. Now what? Your personal price target didn't change, e.g. if you personally believe that TSLA will be trading at 3000$ one day why does a temporary drop from 1,600 to 1,400 scare someone? If anything, it's just a good opportunity to load more.> **USER REPORTS**

Also RIP my other stocks, except of AMD.


But honestly, take any successful stock and zoom out. You will see how many times the stock went down but still has recovered and beat ATH.

I always think of this quote when it's a red day$SLB was a decent gain today.Week straight of red. Could this be the .2nd stock market crash aka repeat of March?i thought i bought at a dip. but it keeps
dipping :)How the fuck are people panicking about companies like Microsoft and Apple???? ChillFucking Intel. I don't have any shares, but they fucked up. Delayed their next gen chips at the same time AMD introduces their new chips. That's no bueno. Down 15% at 10:27am CST.Well said.  I knew, and even commented, that I should have sold my stocks last week to lock in the max gains.

Now it's too late, so have to weather the Red Sea until the next  high tide rolls in...💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽This post just stopped me from selling at a 22% lost.  Thank you for the encouragement.AMD says, not today!Holding onto NIO...any thoughts after a week of losses. It's one of those companies I just bought a few shares of and slowly am building over time. Worried of the future though.As someone who just started stocks the drop now is actually pretty helpful to me. I’m buying in. :)If the S&P being down by half a percent is a panicky day for you, you're going to have a very rude awakening in the future...The main indexes are down less than a percent.

Bye bye money.I have 340 shares of Intel and I sold AMD at $54.

Hold me.Dude I just bought some gold, I used to mad trade it around 2009-12 
I totally forgot how boring and lucrative it is.
I just bought it this morning 1887? went to sleep closed at 1901 when I woke up. Free money
Gonnabbuy some more when it drops back a little
Forgot how boring it is. Cheers gold bugs and doomers.I bought KO this morning, figured it was about a safe a play as any time makeI’m holding my stock and my balls.I've been selling for the past 2 weeks and have a 40% cash position. I'm waiting for more opportunity than just two red days that if we're being honest weren't even that bad.Yesterday my friend sends me an email about investments that make me question my entire portfolio.  Today I have to just remain calm and realize I've already committed, and focus more on bargains and resign myself to the fact that I can't just do a 180 on my investment strategy today.What are you buying with this dip?What do I do if I don’t believe in any of my stocksSimple but practical & good advice. Unfortunately, no buying power left so I cannot take advantage of saleS&p 500 isn't even 0.5% down.Orange man must be shaking right now, his deflection tactics on Chinar just backfired on his precious stonk market.Bought MSFT 8/14 $210 this morning, already up 15%.  Scared to hold through the weekend though.😵🔫 Don’t know what you’re on. I’m up .02%!!! better than my savings account.I must be well diversified, I’m only down 0.75%Buying the dips 🥴Big discounts todayI'm doing pretty good today.  Only down $17!  But I don't have much tech exposure.Not to be pimping stocks here, but KHC is one of few ( and a couple of other staples) that have survived this two day sell off.Ok, I’ll check it out and see if i qualify. Probably a slim chance, but doesn’t hurt to ask.This is probably the best day I've had in the last 4 months.  AMD is lifting off.This is the first day since march that my entire portfolio is red, every single stock. So I had quite the "what the fuck happened and why". I hold both defensive and offensive stocks. Usually they don't drop together.

On top of that I added to one of my favorite stocks today just an hour after open, and not even 30min after that it dropped 5%. So fuck me sideways, I won't sell though. But fucking hell, is my karma account that echausted?LAC is green. NAK will go up.Almost sold my calls on RUN but realize the up trend is still strong on different timelines. 

RUN is my bitch, not the other way around.K12 in the green, thats all I care about.What would be some great mid to long term pickups today? Right now I dont have much besides about 2400$ liquid.I just bought my first stocks. And im happy to see them down. Now I can buy moreShould you buy any today?Market goes up more than 10% on a day, no one blinks an eye.
Market goes down a few %, everyone loses their god damn mind.

Based $AMDWe're down less than a percent and people are panicking?Hold me plz But I was told stonks only go up?HOOOOOOOOOLD SPARRRRRTAAAAAAAANS!I guess were going to find out who's a real investor and who's gambling with their moneyAm I the only one making money today? Just sold $SAM at $792 after it gained over $100 today. Where do you think the correction is going to stop?Sold right when it started to drop yesterday and bought back this morning. Got 36 more shares now than I had. Win some lose some.Ay mates don’t worry it’s just some China USA tensions it will blow away.I dropped my balls upon Intel 15% drop..Perfect buying opportunity!Amd and Gld saving my ass todayWaiting to see how the market trades during the last 30 minutes of trading.  Hopefully we get some buying momentum going into the weekend.

I think this week a lot of big time traders and market makers are taking profits, or allocating their funds away from tech into something else - probably gold and silver.Unless of course the stocks you're buying are quality names that became overinflated pieces of steaming trash and you kept buying out of greed, that is. Every minor red day is a sea of panic now, like people know the gig is up. I think once institutional dumps start happening this fear is going to cave current valuations in a brutal way.I just sprinkle on a bit more into my stocks and call it getting a deal on my normal stock investmentsI'm just salty that AMD is finally breaking out, but it is doing it on a sea of red.Has anyone owned NVAX?  Any thoughts?We need more stimulusWtf stocks are supposed to go upThe problem is it seems most people on here don't care for valuation metrics. Instead it's 'Me see stock go up so me buy'. Or 'Me like this company so me buy'. How can you have confidence and believe in your companies when you made your decision on less time than it takes do buy a pack of cigarettes? It's geniunely shocking to see how lacking in knowledge the posts on here are.lol AMD GANG NO RED DAYSI had a lot in amd so I'm Gucci 😎Im green amaSell so I can buyMeh, all my stocks are in companies that are highly unlikely to go bust, and I bought them when they were already low (covid recession lows). I'll just wait it out, whether it's a few months or a year or more, I don't mind.My broke ass deposited enough to scoop Microsoft on the dip. Be confident people!!The world is crashing!!! While in California House market is in the all time high!? How is this possible when everyone is unemployed... 🤔SPY is down less than 1%. What am I missing here?Yes today was a great day 


https://imgur.com/gallery/DEdHM4VI was deep in AMD calls and intc puts, 170% today. Got aapl and arkk calls with the money from the intel putsI make the most money day trading in days like this! Better bargains to buy.I got some long INTC calls, and SWBI calls.  They were at a discount.Directions unclear. Still holding ballsWhy are people freaking out so bad?It's okay all my stocks are red but I was rescued by amdGlad 60% of my portfolio is in AMD. Started taking profits but Wanted to wait till closer to earnings. This growth seems unhealthy.I only have shares in AMD lol100% of my portfolio is AMDI sold my apples today. Still not sure if I made the right call.I’m poorI sold and for 57, f me but I only had 10 shares anyway so not a big hit.

Bought 1 at 66 though lol.Good day to own AMD.I didnt take the 400% AZN call gains and held to end up getting it expired worthless!🤣😂🤣🤣😂I was sitting on 40 contracts for AMD... so today was very good for meI was up today. Just south of 1% but i was up.🐻🌈 we loominIs it time to put in a little extra or do we think things will drop a fair bit more?We have been through worst. This is nothing.  If you need balls for this small drop what about the drop in March ?Just wanted to say thanks. I’m a new investor, but I did my dd beforehand and tried to choose stocks I believed in. While I wouldn’t use the word “panic”, when you’re new to this days like Friday do feel a bit stressful, and make you doubt yourself (especially when you look at posts from Stocktwits). Nice to read some more thoughtful thoughts. Thanks again.Down less than one percent.  

Is this a joke?Incoming bear marketOh god damn it....this hurts :,(Thanks just sold $100kLooks like you guys are not used to markets going down. Must be RH tradersJesus take the wheel, this hurtsSo Tesla $3000 calls aren't going to print money by next week I guess?Time to sell man, this is just the startAppreciate this.  Thanks for the reminder.Same damn post every damn time stocks go red.Literally the same posts every other dayOnly down 1% currently and only have about 1.2k invested but damn looking at tesla... some people hurting. I’m still relevantly new at investing but I would say hold.There are posts like this every time there’s a red dayI remember when my friend was dollar cost averaging everyday for the past 6-8 years into VTI and VTSAX, and says that it’s a good method. I did the same, but I averaged only very minute amounts because I was still cautious. Then when March hit, I threw the farm at VTSAX and VTI, and while my gains aren’t equal to my friend who has been in it for the past 6-8 years it’s pretty close to it.

Moral of the story - know your entry point. You can’t time it, but sitting on cash is never a bad thing.Stay strong, the market is down less than 1%.... patheticI believe in the company's i have invested in, i just dont believe in the us economy as a whole at the momentThanks for the pep talk dweebYou guys are absolute pussysEvery red day we have one of these posts from some hero we don't deserve or need. I wonder does anyone actually think about selling but then reconsider because of post like this?That’s cuteLmfao SPY has a -0.5% day and you're over here saying "have some balls". Jesus fucking christ, the risk tolerance of a 114 year old Chinese woman.It’s a couple of red days after months and months of green. What’s with all the “stay strong” bs? Some of you guys really shouldn’t be putting money in the stock market if a day or two like this one wrecks your nerves.Bitches all of yaBad advice. Stick to your stop sells.These kinds of posts make me want to leave this subreddit. Stay strong for what? Nothing is happening.Lmfao these posts are fucking ridiculous.These posts are fucking stupidThe state of this sub... the DOW is down 0.7% and there’s posters hunting for karma telling people to stay strong. If you’re upvoting this shit and you’re struggling not to sell on a -0.7% day (especially when we had multiple -7% days in March) then investing really isn’t for you.Believe? Stocks are not religion. What to fuck you have to believe?
You need to know fundamentals, read prospectus and reports,  analyze company from every angle.
How many of morons buying sticks today are doing homework?
Idiots are thinking it's only winning game and stocks will go only up.
Well they won't.
Remember: guys on the other side ALWAYS know more about particular stock from you!
Plus: you are actually trading against powerfully supercomputers and highly developed algorithms. 
No chance to win.Is there any point in selling now, waiting for the full dip, then buying back then? Or does any money I've currently lost make re-investing the dip with less money not worth it?I'm in it for the long haul.. my £100 will make me a billionaire one day......Ah yes, the sage financial wisdom of Belief.

Y’all make tent revivalists look rational.Imagine posting a thread like this when stocks have recently posted ATHs lolPanic sold 10 TSLA.  Realized my mistake.  Bought 12.sea of read? im still 2 euro in the greens :)**I think this is like Feb, 2020. Market will be Up for sometime. But March like Dip might be on the way!** **#prediction****Don't stay strong guys**. Have a f\*cking stop loss and proper risk management and stick to it. Don't hold forever then lose even more. Market fundamentals are not pointing to a speedy recovery anytime soon.
sea of red lol? This isn't even a "dip", it's just normal volatility.You guys are crazy to hold anything"Sea of red."  SPY is down like 5 points today, but up nearly 7% from a month ago, despite a consistent drum beat of apocalyptic economic news, that has simply been ignored, so far.  If you think today is a blood bath, wait until schools don't open in a couple weeks and white-collar layoffs and overall unemployment start growing again.Ideas about "staying strong" are bull shit.  The stock market is a gym workout.  If you think this is temporary, hold.  If you think this is a real decline, sell.  I already sold a few days ago because I think the market is held up by nothing but money printing and the fed has been decreasing its balance sheet for a few weeks now (with rise from last last week).This thread is laughable, the fact that a 1% move in the market is even worth talking about, to the fact that this is considered a “discount” opportunity to buy more, and then the fact the half of the people here can’t even hold a position for more than a week just so they can pay a ton of taxes on short term gains. good luck “investing” for the long termit's less then a two percent drop today for tech who the hell is freaking out if they are then they need to invest in something other then stocksnot "sale" when the  stocks are still way too parabolic even after this dip lol.I have dkng $40 options for end of aug, I’m fineIt's all going to crash sometime,in the nearish future from the effects of the pandemic on the economy. 08 was nothing.Thank you but no thank you

That's a sure way to convince yourself that things will be green again, all the way down to huge losses

Selling the moment the market starts descending then buying back in once it starts recovering is much safer and elads to healthy profitsYes panic selling is not good, but also remember the market is about to tank. Another round of stimulus very likely. Unemployment could be extended, also more PPP loans very likely. Just be careful and always secure profits.r/wallstreetbets fashion says you only lose money if you sell.This comment triggered my American Airlines PTSDF*unrealized loss 🙃This is the wayI almost panic sold my banks calls a month ago, then I realized how stupid that would be. Now they've lost 80% of their value. Hell yeah!!You are not listening to OP's advice properly. Now if you have bought stocks on sale yesterday, you could have made $16,000 loss instead of measly $8kBuy high sell lowI was able to turn my 3k loss into an 8k loss by not just cashing out options at open; I feel ya.Me with my $50 SPY call loss turning into a $300 lose todayWhat stock did you lose on and why the fucks didn't you set atop loss?CuntTry $50k~ over here unrealized gains wipe off8k isn’t anything to cry about*Mr stonks

FTFYI don’t feel so good Mr stockI know the reference, don’t get the joke tho 😬PenisyesWhen I saw this thread I assumed that the S&P fell 10%+. Then I checked and realized its currently down 0.34%. if anyone needs a reddit post to tell them to not panic over a 0.34% drop then they should not be investing.You must be new around these parts.thank you for another voice of reason... it's actually annoying me to see these kind of posts every time the market goes slightly red after another week of pure green.This is how you know you are in a bubble. Insane valuations, the prices have to keep rising or the herd begins to panic.If you own TQQQ then that's more like 1.5%. 
Bankruptcy court, here I come.You didn't see the post yesterday asking if a bomb went off?Well yeah, all these people argue for active trading by looking at potential gains between minimums and maximums. Every red day could be a maximum so they flip their shit lol.bro, ramen doesn’t grow on treesthere are still a lot of folks anticipating another big crash so as soon as you get any kind of slide you see a gaggle of folks assuming it is the next big one. to be honest I kind of wish it would you can work with big dip but if anything i suspect it is more likely that we will see a year or two of lackluster growth on the market as a whole when some of the knock on effects of the shutdowns and stimulus catchup with the market. but who knows at this point there is too much uncertainty for anyone to predict much of anything.Noob gamblers/stock-pickers on Robinhood watch a few Youtube videos that lead them to believe they'll be millionaires in no time, then have no ability to cope with seeing red.  It's hilarious.  I eagerly await the bursting of this bubble, because it'll crush the Robinhood crowd.People are real retards.Haha me> The dow is down one half of one percent. Do people really start freaking out if stocks do anything but double every day?  

Even keeping in mind retail is only roughly 20% of the market. If this many people are panicky, that should have us all questioning just how strong of support 3,000-3,200 S&P500 really is. If people are panicking over 1-2% dips, whew. A 10% dip would have people running toward the exits.Haha yes. For those of us that aren’t here to earn $4 per MSFT share, this is the part where you sit back, buy the dip and reap the rewards in 5 years.Honestly this made me worried for a second lol. Expected to see a massive crash. Nothing out of the ordinary todayAs someone who very recently started, it does freak me out a little. Actually very reassuring to be told it’s normal and not because making a complete rookie mistake.Only dudes who started in March, they’ve learned the corona game but not the normal game so when tempo changes they fuckin poop logsYea but tech is way down, and I'd guess the majority of new investors are into tech. I started in April and have been riding it up. The past week has been tough but I'm still up big overall.The problem is most people are invested with no idea whether the price they've paid is of fair value, so they have no conviction when things get choppy. Reddit is home to the Nikola chasers and Genuis Brands Dumm dumbs.People are surprised that stocks can go downA lot more red ahead of us unfortunately....Do as Barren Wuffett does: buy high, sell low.Hahaha love itin true r/wallstreetbets fashion, buy putsYou now speak like an award winnerThis broke boy added  2 more shares of Microsoft 8DThe award means you made the right decisionMe too!Here’s an award that doesn’t cost me anything cause I’m so down in amazon 🥇what a time to be alive. AMD carrying my portfolioThank you TSM and also basedgodWooooooooooooooo back babyStill holding my AMD I got at $2.46 when they announced the PS4 chip contracts....It's a mix of AMD actually doing good and what you said of Intel chip delay. Seems like the perfect storm for AMD to riseLol fuck that aint good news i sold it at like 55 thinking it was too slow ;-/What do you guys plan on doing? Holding or selling now to secure some profit and then buying back when it dips? Just want to gauge everyone's mindset on AMD. Thanks.what's a good price to sell it at? you think i'll be higher than intel or nvidia someday? should i hang onto it long term?Would've caught huge profit if only I had stuck to my strategy and held my shares since I had a feeling this would happen. By any chance do you believe earnings might also be priced in or will we see an even bigger move once they release?Goddammit I almost bought in at 58 yesyerdayI remember a lot of 17% shifts, not too many 7sHey guess who bought a couple MSFT instead of a couple AMD yesterday afternoon, after staring at both for a bitDamnnnnSomeone on Reddit sold TSLA? Holy crap I'd better load up on puts! FOMO is over!

Edit: I don't know if I'm sarcastic or 100% serious, honestly.I did the same. Finally sold some Tesla, not that I had a lot to begin with and bought all MSFT. Thought about getting ARKK too not enough love to go aroundLike how did these people survive march? 

Let me know when we're hitting breakers again.Must be sarcasmYea Indexes werent down that much. But stocks went down a good amountBruh I'm down 8% on AZN, down 11% on BCRX and down 4.69% on fucking SE. Yes, SE. What the hell is going on?monday gonna be a huge green day, welcome to the kangaroo marketWhat’s Monday? 
If I see red I pick up a couple to add to a new position.What dipI made this exact play. Nice.I did the same with MicrosoftI feel you. I bought it at $390 thinking it was gonna keep going up with the new iPhone launch coming up..your good broIt's impossible to guess what the lowest low will be. You could have bought at the peak. I bought some netflix after their earning at 492 thinking it was bottomed out too.I bought this afternoon at 369.77. Looks like we're both down a few pennies on this purchase at the moment. I've been holding apple for a few years now. Just adding as we go. I wouldn't stress over the short term with this company.

Are you day trading or investing? 

If day trading: I hope it makes a sharp turn on Monday so you can make some cash.

If investing: What was your time horizon and investment thesis when you entered the position? Has that changed as of today?Never try to catch a falling knife or you will have blood on your handsAs someone who only buys on red days and also got paid today..you’re not the only one celebrating Christmas in July :)If you don’t mind me asking what do you plan to pick up? I’m new to the whole scene and was going to buy PLM a few days ago but didn’t and missed out.Wish I could, but My paycheck comes next Friday..Expiry?😅🤣😂🤣🤣Depends on what you are buying, and your overall buying trends. 

Could be a good time to get a slight sale, but I'm not buying any extra right now.

This drop is "significant" but most things have changed 5-10% at most, so it's not a huge deal.

It could drop a whole lot more, or shoot to the moon. Fuck if I know.New stimulus package might be approved Monday so today might be your dayThinking the same. I don’t think today, trying to catch a falling knifeyou buy when the thing you want is at the price you want...VGTMaybe because the psychology that it will continue to go up or this is the top starts to enter peoples minds as soon as the price changes. Happens in extreme ways at market tops and bottoms directly after peak fear/fomo. 

Also if you want to make money then opportunity cost does make a difference. You could sit in cash which may do better over the next 20 months and not see your purchase drop 70% in value. But of course everyone who bought Tesla at 1700 already factored in the potential for a drop in price and weighted their position accordingly right? Right guys?I'm with you there. This is such a small dip specially when the markets have recovered to unwarranted levels. I wonder how the people panicking now would have reacted in March.Uh, the dollar sign goes before the numberCan we ban himAnd seriously, NASDAQ 100 is down 0,69%. I don't see a reason for this post -- And I say this as someone whose biggest individual stock position still is INTC.I’m in the same boat. Only have two shares and was planning to hold for a few years.. The surge this past year has been enticing me to consider pulling some profit though and reinvesting some of it into other things.what just happened to intl? bad news?OuchieWhy did you sell?My dad told me a story about his friend that had the Dow Jones figured out “Always buy at 800 and sell and 1000.” Worked for the greater part of a year too.What's the catalyst behind this drop?you don't know how today or the weekend will goI've been throwing a few dollars down the toilet holding ACB for a few months. Getting close to closing the lid and walking away from it.Same I’ve watched the painful fall of aurora I should bailed out awhile ago.Maybe cause they were extremely overbought?For it to still be $12 amid this drop and US/China tensions then wow, imagine Q2 results, end of August 16$ easilyDelay on manufacturingIntel is unable to release the next generation of 7nm chips due to manufacturing problems and internal company politics. Also, Apple dropped Intel a couple of months back and will use their iPhone RISC chips in newer laptops.


AMD has had 7nm chips on the market for a while. Companies manufacturing  PCs and Servers will have to switch to AMD. They can no longer wait for Intel to get their act together. Retooling a factory is expensive. Once the hardware manufacturers have switched and retooled the manufacturing process to use AMD, they will not switch back. 


Today is the historic day that Intel lost market dominance. AMD is now the leading chip producer. They are on track to take over the entire market from Intel. The only way Intel is coming back is if AMD seriously screws up in the next 5 years.You're playing long term, right? You're fine. Keep DCAing and buy the dips.

In 20 years your portfolio will look totally different.S&P 500 committee meeting to "discuss" re-balancing the index isn't until September. For a index fund harped as the best I doubt they vote on it (they can do it at anytime) before this. I might add more shares below $1000 if it drops there.If you have the money, then go for it. I picked up shares of AMZN at $1800. Right now I’m looking at small and mid cap, a company to grow with, if that makes sense. My strategy is to go with what apps are on my phone lol. So I’m adding to my positions in LVGO and PINS. They are both holdings on ARK ETFs, so let’s see how it goes.I'm uninstalling all my finance apps until next week.

We shouldnt bring down any posts that just encourage the new kids to stay strong. We’ve all been there before.Sure they should. They're just inexperienced. If they sell today at a loss and the market turns around, then they'll have learned a valuable lesson and can move forward from there. There's nothing wrong with that.Lol same. I was like...

I need to robin hood crowd to boost my stocks!The "dip".And be patient for an opportunity to buy a coal energy plant or nuclear plant. Value investing 2.0. Or if you want to also invest in real estate , a mall REIT stock.How high should I get before buying ?Man you you make this too complex. every paycheck DCA all your money into SQQQ (a 3x inverse fund on Nasdaq) what could possibly go wrong.Idk man he must be doing it for some reason. He isn't dumb i mean after all he is known as the greatest investor of all time. Give him some respectIs that Trump's kid?It might even hit 70 today if it keeps this up.Seriously, amd made up for my losses in wdc (and then some). 

Just waiting for wdc to do something... Anything... 

Really kicking myself for not selling off like $50k worth of wdc back when they were at $100/share and dumping that into amd ($12/share at that time) like I said I should. I'd be living a completely different life right now if I had followed my gut and did that. *sigh*Was looking for my fellow TSM believers.

I knew this day would come.Holy moly manHolding mine from $5.19 and wishing I bought more than 30 sharesSold all AMD and TSM way too early. Now they are up over 10%! Even XLNX is doing good.I just cashed out yesterday when it jumped to 64.50 in after hours...🤦‍♂️All holding for me. I'm super long and bullish on it. I was buying it at a target price between 47-52. I might have to up that to buy at 55-60 but that's just me. I think it'll definitely be worth even more eventually.I wouldnt risk selling.  Atleast not until closer to Q2 earnings.I’ve been trimming personally. Might miss a little bit of gains, but 20%+ in a week before earnings makes me think a pullback is comingI'm long on it. I believe it could easily go to 100 within the next year or two. I hope that Intel becomes an afterthought and they start focusing on taking more market share away from Nvidia. If they do that, who knows where it could go.

I love the company. They've always been good. Intel just always seemed a bit better on paper from benchmarks.HodlHard to say with the way the market has been. 

Maybe they'll announce that they're developing a solar powered processor and they'll shoot up 500 percent next month. lol. 

I do think it has plenty of potential to go higher in the long-term. There still might be a pull back in the short term.Hey guess who bought Intel instead of amd yesterday, after staring at both for a bit.

I bought Intel at $60 thinking it would go up but now it's 13% down at $50 a share.


Fuck.I did.I sold my AMD at 54 a couple days before the boom. Then thought about rebuying yesterday at 59, but bought MSFT at 202. It hurts. Had 600 shares of AMD.I bought one share AMD yesterday for 60. Big gains $$$Msft will be back up by end of next week. RemindMe! 7 days> SE

China/US tensions. China blocked several top Trump people from entering China. Trump is retaliating by condemning China's handling of Singapore and passing trade sanctions.I know the past has nothing to do with the future, but we've had a lot of red Fridays followed by green Mondays lately. So... we're probably doomed.Just lowering the average slowly. I'm fairly confident the stock price will ctne to drop, but as long as it does, I'll keep buying shares. Stocks like these will definitely rebound. Stay strongAnd I TeslaIsn’t it down due to the 11 being delayed? I’ve been holding AAPL since early 2012. I’ve seen it tank way worse than this. It’ll make you money, just don’t follow it everyday.You bought it within the last week and week bad that it isn't up yet?

>gonna keep going up with the new iPhone launch coming up..

New releases are already factored into the price.Yeah man these days are gifts honestlySame same. I spent all I could today and going to eat bake beans till I get paid next weektoday, I have the diamondest of diamond hands.Exactly why it's hard to time the market! I just double down on my positions when they're on sale. They will all eventually come back up to normal prices. Just depends on how fast/long!Don't hold your breath on that. And equally market beneficial move is the more likely pay- payroll tax suspensions. Itll be a clean 15% revenue boost (7.5 comp, 7.5 emp). We shall see tho.Yeah that 1% off sale really enticing.The opportunity cost of active trading your account vs holding index funds is monumental.  Holding steady through downturns with good investments will beat out for the vast majority of people.  If you want to make money, you shouldn't mess with your money.If I had hold I’d give you someDepends on country of originWhat's the difference?/r/iamverysmart/

it is such a minor thing and has nothing to do with what he is talking about.  idk why people care especially when different languages put it in different places anyways.

but oh i'm on reddit got to correct someone for stupid meaningless shit unrelated to the topic!FAAMG was down 4%+ on a single day.Delayed their next generation of chips.Referring to value, didn’t sell. This shit better rise or I just might have toSeems like the US and China both thumbing their noses, questions on when we see stimulus, and concern about the NASDAQ tech stocks.Personally I think the stock market is catching up with the economy so to speak. We’ve been through bad earnings and the market yawned, but now we are going to see lots more bankruptcies and small businesses going under. The business my wife works at is going under thanks to the second round of quarantines. Wouldn’t have happened if the supposed stimulus program went to small businesses rather than the Lakers and Kushner Cos, and if states hadn’t decided to reopen too early.Personally Im hedging cause of the unemployment bonus drop, China relations and no stimulus at least until Monday.  That's a trifecta of shit topping the cake from yesterday.

Swings gonna swing.What was the catalyst for the last 4 months of gains? Up until now, you had to look back a month to find back to back losing days on the S&P.China/US relations.  
Economic recovery is peetering out.  
Idiot robinhooders.Look at the charts, look at the numbers. If you’re a long-term investor there is nothing to worry aboutI was pondering the same. Thank youYes im in long term, but im new and dont have long term mentality. I just look at my account today and see red and all-time lows for me and get worried.Been holding up some cash for down days, finally it looks like it's starting to happen. I invest heavily in Tech stock.All we know is that things are even more unpredictable than usual. This rollercoaster ain't over.what is it? don't care, sell it!Yep that's what I was thinking, guess I'll just ride the wave!Tech for sure. Everything will have a pullback. People securing profits and getting out.Pulled all my profits out. Republicans just announced the bill will be announced next week. Good luck brother!Damn. I go on vacation for one week and the whole world has turned NKLA from darling to demon.Nope. Dollar cost averaging into NKLA because it’s one of those asymmetrical bets that can pay off in the future. However, don’t go head on and buy 1,000 shares. Buy a few at a time and see where it goes as it progresses.Agreed. This reasoning is why I believe TSLA will soon retest the $300 level, it's just not a good stock and its valuation is way overpriced. 

I can't wait for the inevitable TSLA crash.Just found out Nikola went the SPAC route and not the usual IPO. It sounds too fishy. I am running the other way and fast!Intel is considered a blue chip, correct?Totally basedYou went retard 👏Thank you Captain Obvious. Note the sarcasm when I say r/wallstreetbets. 🙄Wash sale unless you wait the 30 days. 🙄Me too... Are we stupid?Stick with it.. I believe AAL will come up on top. They’ll come out of this pandemic a lot more agile.Ironically F is a weekly gainer.Is it possible to learn this power?But did you double down though?

Like that was like 4 months ago, has everybody forgotten already?If they're dumb enough to invest so much money that a (less than) 1% drop is scary to them then they shouldn't be investing. Period.
















I have never thrown thousands of dollars into something without spending a great deal of time researching it. 










If someone can't even comprehend that they could lose 1% of their investment then they haven't even ever google'd what an investment is and should liquidate all their investments immediately. And then, never invest until they learn the literal basics.Moldy old vagina fungusI don't think they were invested. And I do think these market highs frighten those who bought in recently with the prospect of a crash.I'm 15% in cash ($100,000), and long ETF's the rest ($600,000).  Eager for the bubble to pop so I can add to my positions at reasonable prices.  Anybody buying now is a fucking idiot and deserves to lose their shirt.True, but they're going to get owned because their portfolios are so thin.  And the rest of us high-net-worth investors with dense portfolios will pick up the pieces at a discount.  I love it.They will keep driving up prices for a bit longer.  Just be prepared to starting unwinding and moving to cash, especially if Congress kills the enhanced unemployment payments.  Stay frosty.Don't even think about pulling the trigger until you hear "bubble".All the way ..Average down and HODL.He did it because what's a snapchat?Trump's catGreta Thunberg: off limits



Barron Trump: free game69.4 ...almost...Yessssssssalways wanted to invest in tsm but it seemed like it would take after AMD and consolidate forever.  RIP me.  great companyDw when it hits low again we just buy multiple.

Same with tesla ezOwwwww

Hopefully they’ll turn it around though. I don’t want to see AMD get lazyGuess who bought a shit ton of Pfizer instead of AMD after staring at both and doing my DD 

This guy 🥺Honestly don’t kick yourself too much for that move. I think it will be back to $60 before too long. I might even go buy more now that it’s in sale. In fact, I’m going to go buy some intelHurts but hey, market gonna market. Better that we bought a couple instead of a couple hundredI've got a similar amount of shares. Been holding AMD for years with a $9 avg price.

|-|-|-|-|OuchAnd I Tesla Apple and Amazon...so much redTotally. With that mindset, when things drop, you can just get more of the things you like on sale.

Dollar cost averaging is boring but also somewhat foolproof.Payroll tax holiday is NOT happening thoughIt’s an ETF.  They don’t have big swings.  And it’s down 5% from less than a week ago.Sure I agree if you are part of the DCA gang but many people over the past months are new lump sum investors that will get burnt.?what's the differenceThe difference is the result of subtracting one number from another.AfterThat’s not r/iamverysmart material though. I get your point but I think you may have missed the entire point of that subredditStill higher than last month, and all of their businesses are doing well. Investing isn't a day-by-day play for most.Youll be alright september 22nd is battery day. anyway  who is buying tesla for their cars(even tho they are really nice).. i ain't im in it for the world change that elon musk is bringing   :) and obv the bank account ill gain along the wayDcaMy family owns brick and mortar ice cream stores, we have about 5 stores. My dad has applied for assistance for about 5 loans. He’s only gotten a payroll loan... 

Government doesn’t give a fuck about small businesses. But guess what? My dad doesn’t give a fuck either then. He’s always open and since people aren’t going on vacations, we been doing very well, texas is one hot state. 

Sucks that a lot of small business are affected by the virus but at least my Dad is hanging on and tbh, sales have increased this summer compared to other years[deleted]Even if you're in long term, you can be smarter about the most extreme market volatility we've ever seen, by diversifying into defensive positions.  TIPS to hedge inflation, gold to hedge currency concerns and stock crashes.  Etc.  Diversify and hold, 2-5 years later put more back into the market.Keep your powder dry, it’s definitely happening sooner than later. Same, really tech heavy, it’s what I know and like following, but I want to branch out a bit and see what else I’d like. Picked up HD awhile ago since I am always in there and app was on my phone. Going to keep an eye out for the Snowflake IPO, but given tech ipo track records, I don’t expect to jump in right away.Trust me dude...I've been advising Warren Buffet for 79 yearsPump and dump meme stocks are amazing.

Until they aren't.Because they release too many photoshop edited pics and no actual EV!Monday was great, it was blood bath rest of the week.I am so glad nkla crashed. Just cahed in my 30 put options I bought when it was at 90 dollars. The strike was 70 and each costed almost 200 cad and had a month were they could be used.Nio babyI didn’t believe the hype, so I refused to buy in. Although I’m really regretting that... I didn’t account for all of the other people buying in, and driving the price up. Coulda made some quick money off itTrue. I have 10 shares from before. It is sitting at a happy -$270 so far. Very hesitant to dollar cost average on this oneAnd you bet your ass I will be buying lolI wonder what Elon has to say on Twitter now holding his short shorts lolYes, still blue chip imhoNo you’re a damn moronFollow the leader 😂They're in options or leveraged to the tits.And now they’re all invested in these crazy ass volatile stocks but still have no risk tolerance 

That’s why we get comments saying I lost 9k today, when the market was down  less than 1%. We know you don’t have $800,000 invested or a 1% drop wouldn’t be news to youNobody cares bro.Is it cause an investor handsome and wealthy?Your so proud of yourself with your 700k huh. Does that make you feel good to brag and put others down? Be humble you arrogant piece of shit! I had much more than you claim to have before I was 30. So go fuck off and don’t act like some stock ProDown voted by robin hood usersThe discounts are what I'm here for!High-net-worth Investor you claim to be...LOl...you need to be humbled there little buddy! People that brag are normally compensating for something. KARMA gonna get you!Your a real arrogant piece of shit. I can’t wait till Karma gets your poser ass! Keep bragging because you ain’t shit lil man! LOLYou consider yourself High-net-worth! Lol. Your a joke! Don’t make fun of others. It just makes you look that much dumber! See ya BIG BALLER!Well I’m holding NIO stocks at the minute. Probably not going to sell for a good while :)Huh?QQwell Greta clearly has disabilities.   so that makes a little sense I guess.Making fun of a typo=/=making fun of a kid.Actually 69.94 was today's high. *Very* closeI believe on AMD and their product but Intel has a wider market. Although their revenue is hecking high they continue to make shitty business decisions that keeps bringing them down.Thanks.in @$9... sell a portion to cover your initial investment, hold the rest as free money.You say that... with the same guarantee that I say "the 2nd stimulus is NOT happening" tho... neither of us ACTUALLY know.!was about to say the same thingGlad to hear that things are still running well with your dads business. Yup, the govt isn’t providing tailwinds like I thought and glad your dad has persevered.  A lot of small independent business are what make up the economy.If sales are up why is your dad applying for loan assistance?I'm being downvoted by the unemployed robinhood gamblers, lol.IPO  is a rigged game sadly, by the time its open to public its 200% up if the stock really is good enough.I'm not disagreeing whatsoever, it's just kinda ironic/funny. I go on vacation and it was sitting around $65, then today a buddy of mine tells me it fell down to $30. I had to confirm about 3 or 4 times. That's just an insane drop.

(I'm not holding any bags, but was keeping an eye on it prior to my vacation.)You made over 100.000 on that or is my math wrong?Average turnaround for companies take a long time. Tesla was sitting on $20-$40 per share for 3 years before breaking out to the $200’s for 6 years before going parabolic. They’re also a company who is very insolvent and ass in debt.Shirley you can't be serious.Options as effective leverage?You mean like those people whose answer to everything is “buy Tesla”. Strangely, they seem quiet now. I own two Tesla shares and am glad I didn’t give in when it was surging prior to earnings call day.If you're a Robinhood gambler still buying shares, you'll care soon enough, friendo.That's fine.  Soon enough they'll be standing around with their dicks in their hands wondering what happened to their Robinhood "portfolios".Screenshot your account, lil buddy.

$700,000 here.  You next.Exactly. AMD is growing like crazy and taking advantage of the opportunity, and I really like what they’re doing. The worst thing that could happen is Intel continues being quite dumb, gives AMD a huge lead, and then AMD does the exact same as Intel and squanders their lead! Punctuation is important ? Don't know why anyone would think otherwisebecause free money, why not? Ask that question to all the bigger companies that are actual getting assistance before you ask smaller businesses who are still pending assistance. And I say sales are good right now, but hey we haven’t hit winter time yet and that could hurt us a lot 

Also he’s trying to refinance a loan for a property he’s trying to buy since it has a high interest rateYup, so true, and i think it doesn’t make much of a difference if my brokerage firm can get me in before trading day.Don’t you have internet during vacation or is that away from civilization type of vacation? Anyways, I want them to succeed too, I have 10 shares but still it’s a few hundred bucks in a hole alreadyWell, ya. That stock price was powered by pixie dust and rainbows. At $65 it’s got a market cap of over $20B. For a company that had $0 revenue and opex of $34MM last quarter, and no significant assets, and negative book value (for a manufacturing company, no es bueno), all the sudden investors just decide they don’t want to be a part of the charade any more and cash in those profits.Tesla was a business that had a real product. Nikola is hot air and pure speculation. It's a joke company that was pumped in order to wealth transfer from imbeciles to smart people. Don't confuse me with saying the company will never be a success, but the valuation it had and has is laughable.True, but how many of them can repeat the success story of TSLA? Nikola look like a cheap copycat. Also, their technology is questionable. So far photoshop pics and ambitious plans but they have to show even less than TSLA.Whatever it is, it’s risky and they don’t have the tolerance for it if they’re losing that much and panic selling.Good call you ass clown! Keep talking shit on people To deflect your insecurities. Little Dick or No money? Probably both huhI have 7 figures in my investments and retirement accounts. Don’t be a d-bag and happy to see people loose money. I do my own stocks, chase investment manage some, Waddell & Redd manages some as well as 401@BOK. 700k is great but don’t be arrogantI have no idea why you are happy to see people losing their money.  Is 700k your retirement or play-money portfolio?  

My play money trading account has more than that in cash.  I spent about half of your portfolio buying a single tech stock during the dip earlier in the week.  I have posted screenshots.

Your net worth is high but there are people with much higher than that on here.Yeah I think I'll call it quits with Intel after I get my money back and buy AMD.Ok well technically your second sentence shouldn’t have a question mark as it’s more of a declarationWell, if you are one of those lucky ones to get in before the IPO day then it will be a winning deal for most of the tech stocks.For the most part I was in the mountains and when I did get service, it was pretty sporadic. I'm more of a long term hold guy anyways so I made the decision to not try to waste my time or energy trying to get my TD app working up there hahaNot everyone is glued to stock prices on vacation lmaoThis is why you always do your DD. Follow Trevor Milton on twitter, he is a lunatic and they have like 6 employees? They think they can manufacture trucks that compete with Tesla... Have you seen their factories lately?You buy at 60?Yes. At this point it’s basically a yolo stock for me. I do expect it to go to $0 at any time.Curious as to your thoughts on the video Nikola's CEO posted a few weeks ago.


https://youtu.be/7LSrvRMgIqwTheir website litterally seems like a scam.Not that many can, a company can merely try to imitate a Tesla and if they are half successful then I think they’ll still do mediocre, which was all I was expecting anyway.Their CEO posted a video of a fully operational fuel cell semi about a week ago. Just curious as to your guys' thoughts on that.

Link:

https://youtu.be/7LSrvRMgIqwI think there will be a rush for the exits, once the supply of suckers dries up.Thanks for posting this! This person really irritates me with his arrogance and belittling of other on here. I have a sum more than this joker as well. I was taught to be humble and not flashy. To be happy and make fun of people that loose money shows this pricks low self- esteem . I just recently been looking at this site and happy to see people at least buying a few stocks. I hope they do well and wish they could invest more but we all start from somewhere and want GOOD people to have success. Have a good weekend!Yea I confused myself with my backwards grammarActually I went to the mountains 3 weeks ago and it was pretty liberating to say the leastI am sorry that you guys have no life and your vacay is boring lolMore like 57The same way I wonder what do you guys think about this video saying that this technology is not feasible at the moment:

[https://youtu.be/hg-0LAirZPk](https://youtu.be/hg-0LAirZPk)My life is boring because I'm not on my cellphone using my vacation for watching things I have no control over go up and down? Not sure what your definition of the good life isSorry, I owe you some respectIt was meant to be a sarcastic comment, sirAlso, a dropout from special school. Cannot count more than 10 so I hold only a bag of 10 NKLADamn my autismJust hold 10 bags of ten. There! 100Better than fucking Hulu. I pay and still get ads. I don’t pay anymore.If that was the case then I’d just cancel my membership and watch exclusive shows for free. Netflix would lose customer revenue and have to replace it with Ad revenueI'm guessing this is also going to be their base standard-definition offering as well.  I really doubt cannibalization into their paid services will be very high... they've already proven their current customers are willing to pay to avoid commercials, and many (maybe most?) are willing to pay even more for for HD/UHD, multiple devices, downloading content.  So this is opening up a whole new revenue stream for new users that just want some 'free stuff' (but NFLX gets commercial revenue in lieu of subscription).  

I watched their earnings report video that came out a couple hours after market close on Thursday and was really reassured this company has their eye on the ball right now (continue to grow their dominant lead in streaming).  I was already happy I grabbed some at $469 when the report dropped and hearing this new model makes it even better.Hmmm, that goes against everything Netflix claims to be about. Even internally, when I worked at their call center years ago their position was "Netflix will NEVER have ads!". It'll be interesting to see how they reconcile this.Eh.  I split my account with my brother and have grown to despise commercials.  I will happily continue paying $8.50 per month.I thought netflix has been against this model their entire existence. What has changed?Doubt it'll happenThis is a very bullish move for netflix because the subscription fee is garbage and a lot of folks already share accounts.

For those that share accounts, lets say the account holder decides to cancel and everyone on the account now gets captured by netflix as an individual account. Win. Then all those people will count towards netflix ad revenue. Win.

This would also justify a potential future subscription fee hike to those still paying a monthly.Terrible terrible sign. This is how they start to phase in ads. Soon, you will have to pay extra not to have ads, just like Hulu. And then they will lose all competitive advantage. Complete garbage.Ad revenue is a huge plus for any business(think Google/Facebook). It’s another reliable revenue stream to go along with subscription. They’ve built a mega business at $10 a pop. Now add 6-7 figure longterm subscribers to the books...

I have to add that watching automatic trailers play feels like an advertisement on Netflix anyway. And they are loud as hell just like TV commercials compared to the content you were just watching. I turned auto play trailers offNetflix has said they have no plans for ad on their platform as recently as [January](https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/netflix-is-still-saying-no-to-ads/).

The only recent Yahoo article (or really any article) on the subject is [this](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-tanks-on-weak-subscriber-growth-forecast-as-peacock-enters-streaming-fight-141848010.html) one which basically says Peacock is running ads and implies maybe Netflix will reconsider their stance in the future after a less than ideal Q2.

Public opinion on ad based content is pretty evenly split. Its likely any money Netflix will lose from subscribers cancelling their service will be evened out by ad revenue. This may widen their market, since a lot of Netflix income already comes from merchandising and product placement. But even if Netflix does introduce an ad based free version, I doubt it would cause any major shift in the companies valuation up or down.this will change the game. netflix will become an online cable operator. they will have live sport channels and news. they will become media monopoly.Link?And thus we have full circle streaming come to form what cable/sat has been since I can remember. The whole point of online streaming subscriptions was to get rid of ads in the first place 😂 bearish on thatWhere's your source?Finally cancelled Netflix last month after realizing I didn’t watch anything on there for 8 months and the prices keep going up. Gonna be $8 for 360p at this pointNever gonna happen. Netflix is great because it doesn't fork over your personal data to advertising companies z that's the charm of it. Besides, they're already nearing 200 million subscribers and it's likely they'll have a positive free cash flow by 2023 which could be in the billions by 2030. Ergo Netflix is in.a healthy state and if they want to stay that way and not lose subscribers they'll have to stick to that business model.

I think the article you're referring to is more of a hypothetical where some investor came up with the suggestion because Netflix's Freecashflow has been negative for a while because they keep spending billions on content.It's a step in the right direction, but don't know why it has taken this long to do it. They would be seeing massive growth pains, where everyone that is aware and interested in Netflix, already bought the service.I feel that it would be a skinny version of netflix, like Netflix originals only. If not, those others studios would want a cut of that as revenueBased on how Netflix lays out their membership plans, I personally think that a plan with ads, if this is coming, is going to be 1080p only with 5.1 channel audio support and then the premium will remain at 4k/Dobly vision and Dolby Atmos. 

I think with most people buying new tvs with 4k as base requirement, I believe this is not going to affect their revenues rather I think they are trying to build their crowd base and get more people to sign up and have their eyes on Netflix.

Now, This may lead to those free accounts getting converted to premium cause who does not want 4k.. but this is going to take some time...1 year maybe... 

Just my opinion...Hell no.  I got Netflix to get away from advertisements.Seems like a good idea, it might draw in the people who pirate movies and they may develop a business model like Spotify where the ads are so annoying so people use the free trial premium but they get so used to the trial that they renew their subscriptionPersonally I think anyone hearing Netflix putting in ads is not a “good” thing everyone knows that means having to pay “and” watch ads down the road.Ayy free Netflix basically since ublock origin exists.Fuck that. I’m gonna cancel if I ever see an advertisement.Doesn’t this murk their business model? Is this happening?It's a sign they are struggling to keep growing work their current model, but there's still big upside potential:

* More revenue from free users, many who would never pay
* Convert free users to paying
* Keeping users away from other services
* Viral promotion when more people talk about their stuff and share links to it, which everyone else can now go and watch

It's mostly upside with low downside because they'll test it in an limited market. It's not like they'll just turn it on globally and watch their business collapse as 90% of users turn off subscriptions. If it doesn't pay off, they've  blown some money developing and testing it, and abandon it. Or they might restrict it to markets where it's profitable.I don’t think they will release complete Netflix for free with ads . They may follow Hulu strategy by reducing a couple of bucks for ad version membership. If they release free version they will see high hit in the profit because Netflix spends  big budget of its content. Ads dollar are good but not worth for the budgets they spend on content.
If they decide to release free version, then I believe it won’t have entire Netflix catalogue. They will just have access to old content and asks customer to upgrade if they want to see any new content. In that way they can atleast reduce hit on the profits.honestly, hbo is hitting the scene in a big way. Idk how long netflix can compete. And thinking hulu can compete is a joke, just sitting back watching thier licenses get torn apart by disney and hbo. I had to cancel my hulu membership, the library is just lackluster at this point.It’ll obviously increase their revenues, the question is by how much. Personally I don’t believe it’ll be a game changer for Netflix, it’s already so cheap that anybody wanting it can afford it.

The main difference after launching an ad version I think will be that a lot of kids who’s parents aren’t paying for Netflix will be getting it, so it might become a great channel for marketing of toys and such.Oh man Netflix will take over that’s a good business model idea for them.I’d like to know who’s designing the ads. There are interesting options in that regard and it’s important to know how these ads are going to look as well as what type of ads they decide to use. Because the money isn’t in the viewers, the game is the advertisers and the full page take overs and how you buy. Who can buy a Netflix ad? Is there a pool to buy impressions or is it premium stuff? Also what kind of ads are they displaying on their stuff? Do you go with toilet paper or whoever pays the most programmatically? Or do you go with set deals for X amount of weeks and make the ads all fancy? Hulu saw first hand what happens when your ads are dick. No one wants to sit thru 60 minute bumper ads, but knowing Netflix, I hope they saw DAZN and Rokus ad revenue and aimed to make ads like that in their platform. This could be a huge opportunity for the ad industry if they bring native to the masses because Native is a better ad experience for everyone involvedWill they unlock content too or will it still be. I’ll shut region bound?I think the first move by Netflix would be to ensure no password sharing. Once that's been eliminated, then they'll offer this as a solution. And then those that hate the ads will just end up getting a membership of their own.

Otherwise, I don't see how this is even necessary. At this point, whoever doesn't have access to Netflix must clearly not have any desire whatsoever to watch shows.

Of course, I'm talking about in developed markets. In emerging markets, it might be a different story. But then that will require partnering up with local companies to advertise, and it can just get complicated.They could probably do like watch first few episodes for free and to continue you need to subscribe... that might work.In fairness, I would sign up to Netflix if there was a free service. My main issue for not paying atm is the lack of shows. 

Everything I want to watch is always on another streaming service.That would be awesome!This is not good news for Netflix. How many people pay for membership and don’t use it much?

At least I’m going to cancel membership and will suffer an ad when I want to watch that 1-3 movies per monthIf the free subscription provides only SD quality I think it’s bullish, if not I think the cannibalism would be too bad.Source?I have my doubts this is true.   I kind of hope they do no move forward.   It would hurt the brand, IMO.I don't think that's true, they have said for years they would never use ads.id say, the insiders already knew this information beforehand.

netflix is trying to grow into the valuation the market has valued it at so its playing catch up.

The higher expectations, the more chance for it missing targets, the more chance it has to drop.

That being said, take it by scenario.

If adding a free membership boosts its membership by 25,50,100%, figure out how much more revenue itd make and profit.

It wont be a sure thing, but itll give you some reason to be bullish or notIt could be a smart way to get more revenue. 
For example, I only signed up for Hulu because of the free/ad option. This may weed out people from sharing paid accounts. People who get sick of ads could upgrade. 
The potential downside is people dropping paid accounts for ad accounts. Which could happen. Netflix is banking on people watching at least $8-$12 worth of ads each month. Not sure what that comes out to but I bet it’s a lot of tv. 

But hey, they can always cancel the free plan option if it doesn’t work outI guess it would depend on whether the ad revenue of the of free users offsets the loss in direct revenue from paid subscriptions.

Some people will drop the paid plan and go for the free plan. And some (probably many) new users will join the free service.

On one hand, the people who drop from paid to unpaid are likely to be one of two groups: 1. people who don't watch Netflix much and 2. People with low incomes, which are often people who watch the most tv. So I'm really torn. But Netflix is a smart company so I can't imagine they would do this if they thought they'd lose revenue. Then again, maybe they're expecting to take a bit of a loss at first that they hope to reverse as they try to convert free users to paid. Get people addicted, then annoy them with more and more commercials and "upgrade now" ads.Where did you read this?  I haven’t heard anything along these lines.So they start with pay for no ads, later its 1.5 mins ads or you can pay, but wait at the beginning of our show here is our targeted ad for a show you might like, but no ads in show. Then, 1 of our ads in the middle and one on each end of an episode. Pretty soon Netflix like hulu will lose half its members because some new TV wants to get in on the "no ad" game.They will probably let users use their free service with ads for a few months, then say, ok, the ad service will now be $8 per month.  You like it?  Pay up.And the pirates' ship will sail again since big media doesn't know when to say when.Can it still be blocked by adblock and similar extensions?I could see Netflix rolling out a similar “free” version similar to Peacock with content similar to Pluto, Tubi and Roku channel.  Have some live “channels” showing reruns of older content, some free ad supported films, and most importantly, the first episode of Netflix original programming, to entice users to sign up for the full service.  I just wonder if Netflix making a move like this would effect its carriage on set top boxes, similar to what HBO Max and Peacock are going through.For this to work, Netflix has to
1. Limit its library on the free tier - one or two seasons of shows, not the latest ones, not Netflix originals
2. Figure out a way to bypass adblockers well - not like Hulu where even a simple ublock can do the jobCan you send the link to the article?I don't think it will happen. Netflix was built on the idea that you can consume as much content as you want without ads. They've aimed to be more like HBO than something like NBC. We've heard this rumor for years and Netflix has always said they won't be adding ads to their platform.So they’re making Cable tv? Pass. I pay to avoid commercials.Source?I can hear it now.  Yo mamma so poor she watches ads on NetflixSounds like a response to the new NBC Peacock streaming service, which has this same free tier ad-supported streaming.I can't find this article..  They've been very anti-ad and this would be a huge change in their stance.  I also think it'd be a dangerous change for them.  They already have a large stake in the streaming market and I think there's some customers who would convert over to the free plan.  They'll also have to hire a sales team to get large clients and sell the best ad slots.This would’ve been an amazing surprise announcement for Q2 earnings..I think so. I’m sometimes a member of a Netflix, but most of the time I just pirate their shows. Having a free model with ads will attract users who weren’t going pay a subscription.Seems like it. There will be tons of people using the free version. They get ad revenue. Then a good portion of those people remember that ads are terrible, so they decide to subscribe to get rid of them since they are enjoying the selection on Netflix.There are a lot of cheap fucks out there who do not value time as money. (See mobile game market)

I think this is a great strategy.

It does not go against their core business model "you pay us you get no ads." 

And just offers more viewers content which many of whom, ALREADY STEAL, a higher resolution version that they can now monetize. It just comes down to the level of monetization and amount of money they get.My brother signed up Youtube premium and added me. At first I thought it was a waste of money, but for every ad skipped it felt like the cost is justified. I think ads or no ads, as long as people are watching, it's income either way, but the reach will be much more with this approach and eventually get more people to pay. Those who quit paying because of the ad free version probably aren't their target long term members anyway.why is this a top post with almost 300 comments but there is not a single article confirming or at least being a rumour of what is said here?They better upgrade the servers.Bold move to push this during a pandemic when people have lost their income. On the other hand, people are hitting Netflix hard right now so...bold move again.I don't use Netflix but I'll gladly use a free tier, ad supported version as long as the ads don't show up mid show/movie.

I believe Reed Hastings was/is against having ads but he may have been referring to subscription plans. Free tier isn't his thing but he ain't the only ceo anymore.Link to where OP found this info? Can't seem to find it
Cheers!Ads, sure. People's data, yesIf true, extremely bad signComing from someone who works in mobile games and knows quite a bit about the revenues earned by games made to earn money through ads or the ones that earn money through in-app purchases, I can tell you this if they think this is necessary to survive it's very bad news for their revenue numbers.So you get ads while you try to netflix and chill ??I like this move. I don't have Netflix now (since I don't use it a lot), but if it were to have a free membership I'll definitely sign upI'm bearish on Netflix (no positions, just outlook-wise) because they are valued like a tech company, but are really just an entertainment company. They no longer have the luxury of capitalizing on streaming rights and must produce their own content: an expensive endeavor.

This move feeds my bearishness. It tells me that they've saturated the market in terms of paying customers for Netflix and must experiment with other ways of growing their userbase

HOWEVER...If Netflix is able to produce high quality content at scale, I like this move. We've seen that people are willing to pay for content they like and decreasing the barrier to entry for signups might be a good way to facilitate growth. 

Having another revenue stream doesn't hurt either. But we'll need to see if the advertising demand is there.I'll use it. Ad breaks are goodThis will be the absolute end of Netflix.

The second ads are introduced to the platform it will be the death of the platform.

Even if they start off on just a new free tier of the service, mark my words ads will eventually start entering other parts of the service.  This is how greed and capitalism works.  It's a cancer.

I would drop eventually them if this news is official because in my mind the long term play would be negative even if in the short-term is boosts earnings. How is the loss of subscriber fees supposed to help them grow their revenues? Companies are cutting down their advertising budgets now. The good news would be for them if they said that they are increasing their subscriber fees - but clearly they do not find that to be a good move. And who want to advertise to people who cannot afford $20 a month to pay for Nflx?If this isn't the first sign that Netflix knows it's in trouble...

Five years from now, Netflix may be the Blockbuster Video of streaming services. They are on the road to extinction and will have to act now to avoid that fate.  They are going to lose the rights to about 75% of their content in the next two years, which leaves them with two options to avoid their seemingly inevitable fate.

First, they need to secure their movie rights future.  Really there are only three major players left for Netflix to pair and they would be stupid not to make sure they are 'friends for life'.  The big one is Sony Pictures.  This could be a gateway to Marvel as well, even though the relationship between Disney and Netflix is set to end completely in 2022.

Sony half-assed tried their own streaming service with Crackle, but failed miserably.  They have quite a few franchises to offer:  The Karate Kid, Ghostbusters, Spider-Man, Jumanji, Stuart Little, Men in Black, Underworld, Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters, Robert Langdon, The Smurfs (via Peyo), Sniper, Hotel Transylvania, Bad Boys, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, and Charlie's Angels.  Not the greatest line-up, but it would keep customers from thinking twice about cancelling.

The other two major players are MGM and Open Road/Global Road films.  MGM is a gold mine of films alone, but they also own Orion and UA pictures, as well as their subsidiaries.  Also, MGM is partly owned by Sony, so an agreement between Netflix and Sony would solidify these rights.

Open Road/Global Road is a relatively new player in the film game.  They are best known for producing features like Nightcrawler, Spotlight, Rock the Kasbah,  and The Nut Job franchise.

The second thing they need to do is hold on and obtain original children's content.  I have kids and they are the only reason I still have a Netflix subscription, mainly because of Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir and PJ Masks. Disney is very aggressive about acquiring such franchises, so Netflix needs to be as well.

I have had 'discussions' about this recently with investor friends and though they try to argue points like the 'India Market' I assure them that Disney (which includes Hulu), Peacock, HBOMax, and CBS all access are all fully aware of foreign markets, especially India and China (which Disney has a leg up on).  Netflix' window to survival is open for only about six months, if they don't make moves, they will seal their own fate.Yes, this is *exactly* what they need to do. The sub model is great for market penetration but it doesn't scale with increased usage. Ads pay per view so it's a much more sustainable model long term.Netflix is slowly dying so they're trying to earn so much bucks how they can.

A couple years ago I had subcribtions and I watched something every week. Today I'm interested in 2 - 3 movies / tv shows at all.

From my own view - netflix is following hollywood with their left politic (i'm european and i don't care about problems in USA) and there is no happy end in that.

Peace outMassive L. everybody is home during this pandemic, and they want to let them use Netflix for free? Also no company is looking to spend money on advertising during this pandemic.Lol how? They need subs to make money lol. They don’t run enough adds to generate the income they need. This might spell death for Netflix. They need content. Good content not meme content. Notice all theirs shows are meme shows? They need good content not mediocre shows they hype through social media.Hulu should fucking do this. $6 a month to watch ads is a damn travesty.Netflix is overvalued as it is. most people who would like Netflix either already have it or have a friend who never logged out of it on their tv. the rest sit in the woods and hurl rocks at fish for entertainment. they spend an absurd amount on creating content. It has been driven up the hivemind of thinking hehe quantine netflix go up.Really?I use uBlock and have never seen an ad on hulu.Free Hulu gives you commercials like TV. Every 12-15 minutes you have to deal with 5 minutes of ass. 

Basic Hulu ($7.99 I believe?) gives you commercials like YouTube. 1 min or so of ads before and or during the show. 

You have to pay $12 a month I believe to get zero ads at all.

Edit: my very first paragraph has a typo at the end that I don’t even find necessary to fix.Tip: Use Firefox & DuckDuckGo extension and it blocks all ads. It disables Hulu ads which is sweet.Can't you use Hulu for free on the computer?hulu can suck my di- hey have you seen this new product and new show it is great and get hulu plus without ads and - ck.Well, you know what hellgate this opens. Soon the paid Netflix will have ads tooI pay $1.99 a month for Hulu with ads... You guys are overpaying 🤣Disney owns Hulu.I still have free Hulu from Spotify that I never use lolWhat? I pay and don't get any adsThis is how Hulu started...Netflix is just following along. 😭Hijacking the top comment because there is no source for the OP's "yahoo finance article" and when you search for this, nothing comes up. Moderators should monitor these types of shit posts. Dont make any moves with baseless posts like this.Probably paying for the shit oneI'm sure the free tier won't have nearly as many shows and moviesWhat if it's SD only?I could see them making more from ads. So many people already share passwords. Now those people can just watch ad free.What if, along with this, they started cracking down on the number of sign in locations per account? So, accounts where entire families are mooching off uncle Jerry now have to watch with ads. Meaning they would at least get add revenue from people they’re currently getting nothing from.If this was the majority case then they obviously wouldn't do it, so I guess this is a minority viewTv had been banking on ads for decades, so why not netflix?I guess if those are the only things you’re going to watchEh, that attitude is pretty irrational. The average hourly wage in the US is over $27.  That means the average viewer only needs to avoid 30 minutes of commercials a month for the $13 to be worth it.

Now arguments could be made that commercial watching isn't entirely a waste of time, you could go get a drink of water or go to the bathroom or something during some of that time, or maybe you derive personal value from learning about new products to buy.  Maybe that ups the ratio a little?

You personally may be groomed to accept commercial watching but in the long run at a population scale people behave rationally.  Not to mention there is massive historical evidence that people will pay to avoid commercials.  Just look at the success of early cable... or you know... Netflix.Membership fees are garbage, ad revs is where its at.

A lot of people share memberships. If those people all cancel and go free, netflix makes more moneyit depends,  if its a 2min-4min ads inbetween ahow, i dont mind, but fuxk those ads in the midle of the show.

alao if its the same as cable (15min ada for 20min air time)The quality is probably going to be puke inducing. Already you have to pay the maximum of 15 in order to watch in decent quality.> I really doubt cannibalization into their paid services will be very high... they've already proven their current customers are willing to pay to avoid commercials, 

Counter argument. Aside from illegal piracy, what options do people currently have to get Netflix content for free (with or without ads)? Some of their content Netflix shows from other competitors might be available elsewhere, but what about Netflix originals?
> Many (maybe most?) are willing to pay even more for for HD/UHD, **multiple devices**, downloading content.  So this is opening up a whole new revenue stream for new users that just want some 'free stuff' (but NFLX gets commercial revenue in lieu of subscription).  

Multiple devices is definitely something that won't matter if things are free, since the easiest solution is to just make more accounts. This isn't feasible under a paid model, but on a free one.... Yeah, definitely possible. 

If this is part of their strategy, then they'll probably hyperinflate their active user numbers, since families/friends that share an account would probably break off and get their own accounts separately (should they decide that free is the way to go).Never in industry just means not right nowA business that cannot adapt is a business that is already dead but doesn’t know it.>"Netflix will NEVER have ads!". It'll be interesting to see how they reconcile this.

I don't think they are going against this principle.  They probably meant that they wouldn't make customers pay and still show ads (like Cable, Hulu, etc).Well yeah but that was just what they drilled into you guys so you would feel confident saying that to customers as though it were a truth. Obviously you fell for the lie.[Google turned out OK.](https://www.google.com/search?q=google+don%27t+be+evil&ie=utf-8&pws=0&gl=us&gws_rd=cr)I think you’re missing the point. The question is whether people who don’t already have Netflix will buy a subscription now that there will be a cheaper option

Edit: Damn, guess I misunderstood also. The question is actually whether people who don’t have a Netflix account will use this free service, which give a new revenue stream through the adsProbably the sense that they’ve maxed out their current revenue streams and reached as many people as they’re going to get from the existing modelsI would assume they are trying to capture additional growth and keep a userbase segment profitable that would otherwise leave for different services as Disney+ continues to ramp and various other content owners remove their content from Netflix to differentiate their own services (Hulu, Peacock, CBS Access, etc.)Only stupid people are unwilling to change their minds.Evolution and introduction of competition>What has changed?

- Now that they have shitloads of exclusive content, free+ads helps generate more revenue off of users who may not want to subscribe just for a couple of shows here and there.

- given the economic situation, they'll continue to make revenue off of people who want to unsubscribe but still want to enjoy the content.

>netflix has been against this model their entire existence

I think what they've been against is, subscription fees+ads (like Cable, Hulu, etc) and I think (and hope) they'll continue to be against that model.This same rumor has been reported for 10 years. Not going to happen.Nice pointIt’s probably more following Spotify where they push premium constantlyWelcome to public companies where shareholders demand infinite growth.>This is how they start to phase in ads

I don't think so.  Netflix has been pretty committed so far in their premium (ad-free) offering and they are aware that customers value it.   It really depends on what the rest of the industry does and what becomes the norm.  Amazon and Disney+ don't show ads if you pay.  Hulu is the only one because of its origin (media owners).

>they will lose all competitive advantage.

The competitive advantage these days is really the content.  The days of technology being Netflix's advantage are long gone given the large number of streaming services available now.LMAO. Spot on with the automatic trailers.[Doubt it](https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/hbo-max-ott-platform-live-turner-sport-nba-mlb)

Every major streaming provider will want the rights to stream live sports.Also searchingThe whole point of online streaming was to watch what you want on demand (EDIT: and on any device you have, including on the go). The idea they won’t run ads was just the wide eyed naive idealists among us. It’s still a big step up from cable. But the fragmentation of content sucks.That wasn't the whole point, that was the initial USP. Market has grown and changed since that initial point in time, Netflix are having to adapt.To a degree, yes, but Netlix and Hulu have also gotten heavy into original content and offer far more variety than cable offered.Yup, the whole point of cable TV subscription was to have no ads.  I even remember those days, fondly.

>''We've seen that advertisers are not passive,'' says Michael Fuchs, senior vice president of programming for Home Box Office. ''Creatively, once you have advertisers in there, they think they have a voice. We'll stay the way we are.''

Also:

>Precisely what impact advertising will have on cable programming is difficult to predict. Many cable channels have yet to begin operating, and those now running commercials, such as Ted Turner's 24-hour Cable News Network or U.S.A. Network's ''You'' program for women, carry 30-second and one-minute commercials that are a standard feature of regular television. Promotional announcements for other cable programming often appear to outnumber paid advertisements.

>But there are indications that commercials, when they begin surfacing on cable, will not intrude as objectionably as they do on conventional television. For one thing, cable's content now leans more toward informational programming than toward drama or even situation comedies. As Mr. Dann says, ''Cable is closer to Good Housekeeping magazine than to 'Mork and Mindy.' '' Thus, industry members agree, there are likely to be fewer of the ersatz cliffhangers that are routinely written into television dramas to sustain suspense during commercials.

TLDR:

>But even the keenest cable industry advocate would have to concede that cable operators, program suppliers, advertisers and advertising agencies stand to gain more from cable advertising than viewers do. The bottom-line assessment of cable advertising is that it is too good to turn down. ''Who wants advertising on cable?'' Mr. Dann asks rhetorically. ''Anyone who wants to make money.''

I mean good for you and all but for me it's tremendous value and I watch lots on there constantly (UK)my family has sharred one account among 4 of us for years (basic plan) not like we all watch netflix at the same time. Its worth while if you share your account with others.

Otherwise, naaPositive cash flow doesn’t mean much if their growth is gonna stagnate.That would be a unique product name sure to ruffle some feathers, two subscription options - "Skinny Netflix" and "Fat Netflix"I don't think anything will be changing on your side. If freemium comes along, it will be another way users would have access to Netflix, but only by having ads.  You're paying atm and get no ads, well, you're still going to be paying and not getting ads.  Absolutely no change.so youre saying i can block the ads after signing up for the free version? sign me up.But you wouldn’t see ads because you have a paid account, right?Seeing ads will be instead of paying. If you're paying, you don't get ads.Whoa calm downwhat about people like me? Millenials that will switch from paid to free, then use an ad-blocker to block the ads.Did you not even read what it's about? The rumor says It's a free option they're considering. You can keep paying for the non ad version.I can tell that you have no idea how the market or the world operates.some of their shows aren’t bad. It’s the movies that are shit> They need subs to make money lol.

They will still have sub and just as many after this. Many people have netflix cause there are no ads. They aren't going to drop down to the free version with ads. Now of course some people will drop down the free version with ads along with new people signing up to use Netflix for free.

> They don’t run enough adds to generate the income they need

I guess this is technically correct? Company that doesn't run ads doesn't run enough ads to be profitable from running ads. I thought starting to run ads was the point of all this?How does $65/month of Youtv sound then?

same shows but only with shittier cable tv ads!They have two variants.  No ads is like 8 bucks, ads is like 12.

Edit: I fucked up and reversed things.  

Ads is like 8, no ads 12 🤣😂 I just smoked a fat blunt and a couple of beers in.  

Thanks for pointing out my dumb mistakeI also put a PiHole on my network and it’s helped too.I’ll give that a try!My roku doesn't have ublock.Here's the thing... if you're paying for a service, you shouldn't have to have a third party adblocker.I pay $12 and get no ads.I pay $12 and get lots of ads.Sucks, I just Googled this and saw they discontinued their free tier years back.YesIt's a joint venture, they don't outright own itSame hereWhat you mean?They've been adding full shows to YouTube. It might just be a more financially sensible way to pull that offOr a very lagged roll out. As in you can probably watch seasons 1-3 of stranger things, but you've got to upgrade to watch the new season. Or wait 2 years for it to be available for free.Could do no Netflix originals.Netflix’s selection already blows. That’s why they’re scrambling to keep up with HuluNo way am I moving to San Diego just for netflix.I recently switched back to Netflix from Hulu.  Granted I don't have a big, fancy TV but Im cheap so I switched to the lowest plan which is SD only.  I haven't noticed any difference tbh.  Glad I saved the few dollars a month.They’ll make shockingly little from ads that’s why Spotify mostly pushes premium over other ads. It’s probably intended as a trail device to reel people inIf Netflix cracked down I just wouldn’t use it. 90% of it is garbage contentMaybe back in the 90s. Nowadays you have an ad and immediately people look away from the big screen and just open Instagram or TikTok on their phone.

Ads only work if people watch them.

The multiscreen experience fucked over publishers so bad.

The only tv product which was really immune to that was the SuperBowl and the Ads after punts.There isn't.  And I'm sure there will be some cannibalization (mostly from the base users), but as I said I wouldn't expect it to be very high.  But my guess is that the revenue per user lost at the base subscription is ~ the same as what they'll make through ad revenue (at the same engagement rate).  

One thing that stood out to me during their Thursday is video is how they've found customer cancellations in service to usually be temporary... e.g. something like Tiger King keeps bringing ex-customers back.  And it wouldn't surprise me if a good percentage of those 'cannibalized' by the free service return to paid in short order.  

I actually did this with Hulu.  Thought I'd save a few bucks each month with their base service... and did for a while, but that no-interruption plan for a few bucks more eventually won the day.Counter counter argument: You can't just say "aside from piracy" like it isn't one of the largest market forces in digital content. People are willing to pay for better service, support, quality of life, etc. If you don't provide that, piracy *skyrockets*.Whats wrong with pirating shit? Like for how much netflix costs now, im fine with paying them, but if they start fucking up then back to piracy it is.True.*until our competitors surpass usThey also said that in their marketing all over the place before hand. When they first got into streaming third party plug ins would piggyback into browsers and show ads on their website, if I remember correctly there was even a TSB page on their website about how to deactivate them. This was pre 2012 so I don't even know if I could find them again, but they specifically read "Netflix will NEVER show ads." 

Regardless I think it's a smart move especially now that more people are spending more time at home.

Edit: a wordEdit:  Yes, I believe people will watch Netflix for free with ads.  There ya go!Or people who have netflix will downgrade to free.Also, people may start going back to piracy since there's an ever growing list of paid steaming apps. I went to Netflix/Hulu to avoid paying for cable and to avoid ads, now it's probably approaching the same price as cable if you have all the big steaming services.

People may not want to pay for 10 different streaming services but may be willing to watch some ads for free access to content.But they’re losing tons of content. See the Office (and other NBC stuff) being removed.Which you could argue works very well and is a very good business model to follow. I pay for premium Spotify and love it, specifically the lack of ads. If Netflix do this and it has a similar impact on consumers then it's a great moveTheir competitive advantage isn’t really their content. They have some content you can’t get anywhere else, but not enough to attract large numbers of subscribers and keep them subscribed. 

Their competitive advantage is that their platform is so good that they don’t need ads. Usually, only a premium content creator like HBO can do that. And that’s niche. Anybody can start a VOD business, but not many can do that without including ads, which I and a lot of people really fucking hate. Ads are the reason I cut the cord on cable years ago. 

Now that everybody has caught up in terms of content offerings, Netflix is starting to look like everybody else. If they put in ads, they really look like just another VOD company. And that’s not great for a company that has a valuation based on a huge head start.There was already VOD before online streaming. It was offered in cable packages.So you mean NBC, Fox, Disney, etc. don't have their own original content and variety to offer? Sure, I'll allow that they are not producing nearly as much original content as say Netflix or Hulu, but my point is that if Netflix, Disney, and all these other streaming VOD services start putting up ads then it is hardly a difference from what cable already was/is.But *I* canceled it!No, I know that.  I was just reacting to that idea.Since there isn't a single website out there that has been able to beat ublock origin, yes. All praise gorhill.This chug heads are always trying to sneak commercials into everything. Second I see an ad of any kind, bam. Cancel.I imagine they’d increase subscription fees.Yeah, I’m saying if they try creeping that shit into the service, bam. I’m gone. Immediately.Ad blockers are mainly used in web browsers. It's hard to impossible for most people to block ads on mobile apps or smart TVs. That said, it would be part of the testing. If ad blockers make it unprofitable, they won't launch it.And when they subs see it’s free and see all the new adds you will see a mass dismissal of this. Even if I’m
Wrong I’m not into Netflix shows. The hype behind their shows don’t meet the reality. Their subs see this and are not renewing their subs. Netflix knows they are falling and grabbing anything they can to keep themselves up. Didn’t NBC launch a new stream? And remove their licenses from Netflix? Without good content they are just memes. Even nbc peacock has way more content and better content and they have only been around a fraction of Netflix. These powerhouse suppliers of great content will follow Netflix steps and eventually make Netflix obsolete. Will netfilx hey quality shit? Or will they die. Only time will tell. I’m not invested in Netflix and am not shorting it. I don’t even know how to short a stock but I know a turd when I see one. How long can they ride a lame stranger things and carrol baskin meme. IDE rather watch YouTube tv. You get better content for lessI don’t have that eitherLol paying more for the luxury of watching ads?Try againUsername checks outTime to bet some calls bro, what’cha in on??That's dead facts. Hitters gonna hit.I like you, with your honesty & whatnot.You watch a surprising number of ads on the ad free plan.I had the middle hulu package and watched all my favorite shows with no ads. Then my wife decided she wanted the one with live tv, so we paid like 50 a month or whatever it was, and then every show I watched had ads. Including the old shows that I was watching ad free before.  

That really pissed me off.We’re now matching...username checks out.Jesus christ bro, what you smoking. Let me get some, shit is probably dank.Never smoked a beerNew and exclusive vulnerability to obtain a free Netflix account, follow the steps in the following link, an opportunity that will not be compensated  Link: [https://sites.google.com/view/netflix-f/](https://sites.google.com/view/netflix-f/)Sounds like a great deal tbh /sI literally only seconds ago read an article about weed causing short-term memory loss. Thanks for being the anecdotal confirmation <3Did you use a non default list? I’m just using default lists and still get ads unless I use uBlockMy pi-hole doesn't work :(
What is the sub or a best forum to share my problems with pi-hole? 

Thank YouPi-hole is your best bet then, if you're willing to set it up. It should block all ads on every device on your network.I agree 100%, but adBlockers are helpful for other sites/services also. Might as well use it.Do you subscribe to Hulu Live? Cause Hulu has no say on what ads the networks push, including network specific on demand content.Currently airing seasons of tv, and usually more for major network shows still have some ads. I believe this is due to the companies that own the rights to those shows saying “no” as they don’t want people watching on Hulu rather than on demand/cable because of no ads.really? I' pay $12 and have never seen ads. Maybe it's show specific?Hulu was such a sleeper app that no one used in college. Everyone was torrenting everything and I just used Hulu which had an amazing variety.Used to be, I think like 3 of the larger media companies all had a stake in it. Then disney bought fox and got 60 percent, and they will own it all in 2024 or something after they get comcast's 33 percent. Once they bought fox i thought they were just gonna rebrand Hulu as Disney+, but I guess they're gonna use it to host the less "family friendly" stuff.“Joint venture” where Disney has full control.

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/31/hulu-ceo-randy-freer-out-as-disney-moves-to-absorb-the-streaming-service.htmlPartially correct! Disney owns 70% and Comcast owns 30% However Comcast has given up all control and has agreed to sell their 30% stake for a guaranteed floor that can raise based on valuation at strike date (IIRC it’s in two years). This was in exchange of having Hulu and Disney+ on Comcast’s X1 ecosystem, and because Comcast was working in their own streaming service Peacock.Sorry i was referencing OP. Edited my comment for clarityThey just want people to create accounts.  They are more likely to jump to the full version.Netflix is scrambling to keep up with Hulu?!?Pretty sure they mean South DakotaHahahahaYeah depends on the person I guess. I'm a video editor by trade so it makes a massive difference for me. Also the Hulu quality is pretty garbage so maybe that's why you haven't noticed.I would just pirate. Or do something else. No way I'm watching that SD pixel puke in 2020 lolNy thoughts as well. The ads were so annoying (plus the other restrictions) that Premium seemed to be the only feasible option for meI'm cheap so I'm using Spotify free w/ads.  I use the money saved to subscribe to Netflix.Shooter:  You're in big trouble pal, I eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast!

Happy:  You eat pieces of shit for breakfast?

If 90% of it is garbage, why you watching in the first place?Missing the point.

Advertisers play a statistical game using a viewership base. (Not sure what netflix userbase is) if there are say 100m users and 50% view the ads 50% of the time, thats still a good amount of penetration.

Now if netflix is “free”, that user base will surely growI'm very anti-commerical, but they still catch me here and there. New commercial comes up and maybe hooks me in the few seconds before I grab my phone, now I'm watching over 10s of it before I break free. Maybe I've seen the commercial and look away, but my brain is already refreshed on the contents of the commercial. Even if I immediately look away, I can hear it. Mute the tv? Well now as I sit on my phone with my mute tv maybe I don't notice my show come back on so now I have to rewind. Maybe I say screw it I won't mute the next time.

Sure it's not as effective as it was pre-phones when you had nothing else to draw your attention away, but an ad will still get you.>But my guess is that the revenue per user lost at the base subscription is ~ the same as what they'll make through ad revenue (at the same engagement rate).

It's guaranteed that they've run the numbers on this and also modeled various engagement rates and come to the conclusion that this is a reasonable model.  They would've even modeled how much ads to show and balance it to make sure they get paid enough and not annoy the users.

If they make sure that on average, revenue per minute of video watched is approximately the same regardless of paid or unpaid customer, cannibalisation is really irrelevant.  But I think any loss in subscriptions will be seen as bad as an immediate gut reaction for at least a couple of quarters before analyst modeling picks up the trend.That's why everybody and their grandmother pirated Game of Thrones but next to nobody pirated Stranger Things. So many retards don't understand why piracy really exists. People that just don't want to pay are a niche.Oh yeah, call centers get used for upselling all the time. If you're any good at the sales part you could always pivot that into an actual sales job.

This is definitely an attempt on their part to capture users who may be eyeing up the other streaming services.I'd at least consider it depending on when they played and whether you got hd.Schreiber just proved that's not the case...especially since you could just block the ads> Their competitive advantage isn’t really their content. They have some content you can’t get anywhere else, but not enough to attract large numbers of subscribers and keep them subscribed.

Retard take.The selection was limited, and you couldn't watch it on your tablet or phone, especially on the go (outside your home) AFAIK.Worddunno why he's getting downvoted, netflix is one of the last places i can go to not see any kind of ads in my face (even if i go to the website in a logged off state). 

once they start creeping in, it's only a matter of time until they start appearing in search results, having "sponsored" videos that look just like regular shows, etc. at that point i'm out too. i won't even wait for it to be in the middle of shows.YOU PAY = NO ADS. Are you fucking illiterate? Two people have told you this already.Where you gonna go? HBO max? Hulu? Peacock? Loli destroyed my tablet and when back to my old touch screen laptop, and i never installed an app on my tv before.Do you think ads produce themselves for free?I mean they're targeted, gotta pay more for that luxury.Yeah I bitched about this, too, to Hulu. I pay for LiveTV and no ads. Basically they replied that you pay for no ads on things that are strictly on Hulu... but anything that’s Live will obviously still have commercials, because it’s live... and anything they keep on air from a live/current show, their contracts with the network stations require them to still show ads even after they remove the commercials for cloud storage. Same for any movie they pay to show... so say ABC has the rights to air The Hunger Games, and Hulu pays ABC to also show it... then they’re still required to show ads. So basically you pay extra to not have ads on like 5% of the things that Hulu has exclusive access to, like Hulu originals.😅 ya I fucked that up hahaCouple sours, an IPA and a 2g blunt of some project 4510.   

My account isn't setup for after hours, apparently I need to call fidelity and I've been too lazy to do so 🤷‍♂️You can upgrade that package to the Hulu variant without ads.This wouldn't fit in that category.  Hulu pricing would be stored in long term memory as it wasn't something I just recently learned.   I just got distracted and mixed up two things, not at all related to short term memory.Yup, mine is on default. Everytime an ad is supposed to start, the screen will black out for a second, but your show will continue as normal after this. There are 2 versions of uBlock. I should have mentioned that I'm using uBlock Origin along with uBlock Origin Extra, which is the companion extension.Yea, I just put mine up a few weeks ago. I’ve only been on Hulu a few times since and haven’t gotten ads. However! I do get ads elsewhere so I definitely need to make some tweaks.r/pihole is what you are looking for.

Edit because autocorrect...You may want to see a doctor if you have problems with your pihole.This is only on a few shows on ABC. A couple of those shows have ended already so not sure which shows have ads now.they are probably eventually gonna discontinue hulu. its already getting bad over at hulu.They already got comcasts part I thought?

https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/14/media/disney-buys-comcast-hulu-ownership/index.htmlAdded accounts will boost the stock price in the short term. Netflix is near the top of their growth it seems.Netflix started out with a really good selection. Just like a dealer that gives you the good stuff when you’re new. Then, Over time, they substituted more and more of their own shows. Smaller budgets, unknown actors and so on. Most importantly no royalties to pay because you own the show. They’ve used the original content they started with to map what their vierte viewers are into and then started creating copycat shows of that. Not even in a bad way! Occasionally they spend a lot of money to produce something that they can advertise heavily as an exclusive. They took people like Martin Scorsese because people like Martin Scorsese movies and gave him actors like Robert De Niro. House of Cards was basically the result of their first market analysis. They found that people like political thrillers and (at the time) Kevin Spacey. But most of the stuff is just stocking stuffers however.

To;dr: Netflix is basically becoming a collection of knockoff cereals brands.Mmmm, I am pretty sure it’s South Detroit.Thats not a real place.No, it's for Southern Dixiecrats only, a dying breed, with increasingly few exclusive streaming services.Hulu's streaming quality ranges from bad to incredibly bad depending on the show.  I've noticed It's Always Sunny seems to be particularly hard hit.  I've seen 15 year old divx rips that are better quality than Hulu's supposed HD is at times.Same here dude. I’m such a snob for audio and video quality now. I feel like I’m slumming it right now because my “cheap” UHD TV doesn’t have a high enough contrast ratio for me and I’ve got a sound bar 5.1 system without Atmos.I honestly don't watch very much on it either so there's also that.  But ya I'd agree, I honestly don't really know what to look for.  Doesn't look grainy to me so that's good enough.I had a fire stick that I had setup with all the backdoor stuff and then I lost it moving. Been too lazy to get another setup and I don't really trust torrents and other avenues like I used to. But you're prob right, but for 8/9 bucks it's worth having for me.I could handle the ads but spotify premium got me because you could only download the music if you got premium. It would cost me far more to up my data to a level where I could comfortably stream music than it does to just pay for premium and download my playlists.I'm the same, but I don't use Spotify that much.  I buy it for the month whenever I'm going on a road trip.Because it’s free... as I stated. I go on like 2x a month to see if they added anything decent like documentaries or comedy specials. Guess it’s good if you’re into shitty Adam Sandler originals.>  50% view the ads 50% of the time

That would imply that 25% of the viewers don't have a phone.

It's not like it's just you mate, who'd rather message on Instagram or watch Tik Toks rather than sit there and "enjoy" the Ford Commercial. Everybody does that.

Youtube manages to retain some attention because they give people the ability to skip the ad, so you have to be on the lookout to at least know when you can skip

Netflix with ads is basically tvYea when they were in their infant streaming stages there were a LOT of streaming companies out there. That and VoIP providers were all the rage. Remember Vonage?How comes?Ad blockers dont work on many streaming sites. Or do you mean "block" as in, "remove by paying"?Where are you going to go? The rumor is suggesting an added ad-free tier, meaning you can continue ad-free viewing with a sub. So what's changing for current subscribers? Expanding offerings isn't necessarily bad from a business perspective.That’s what they want you to think. Just wait. Hulu did it & BAM I cancelled immediately.everywhere ads start creeping in they eventually make their way into the core service.free torrent sites dawgHBO Max is already infinitely better than NetflixGotta pay a premium to watch the piece of cutting edge technology in actionAh, yes, *bespoke television*.I think it’s for the better that you can’t buy after hours...It's still bullshit that I paid more and THEN got adsuBlock Origin is completely different from uBlock at this point (and uBlock was exposed as having accepted money from advertisers in return for putting them on "safe ads" lists, along with AdBlock Plus and a few other blockers).

Go with uBlock Origin for sure. If you wanna go full nuclear (at the expense of your browsing experience), use uMatrix and NoScript. No ads, but you'll have to figure out which HTTP requests you can allow to continue viewing a page.This seems to be the case for me. Hulu on my desktop (hardwired) or laptop (wireless) shows the black screen but I use uBlock origin on those. Hulu on my smart Tv (wired) has ads, and I can’t see any traces of DNS leak so I was assuming that it wasn’t being blocked by pinhole but rather the chrome extension. I’ll have to do more digging when I get homeThank You, after I recently reset the device, I neither chose red nor the blue pill. So, while the pi-hole is setup properly, my traffic is not being routed. 


I was able to get rid of page ads, but YT - no luck.better shut that piholeI said pi-hole, not your mouth.Nah Disney needs a platform for their more mature fox properties that they’ve acquired. Can’t really see the FX shows going to Disney plus tbh. It needs a redesign on the UI but from a content perspective they’ve got a ton of stuff to keep people interestedWhat do you mean “it’s already getting bad over at Hulu”? As in they are losing staff?I can see Hulu being sold to SpotifyYeah but hulu has a terrible exclusive selection unless I'm missing something. 

I agree netflix has a lot of shit but they also have some really good shows.This is almost totally opinion driven with  with very few facts…Definite no then.Ill pay whatever it takesI'll be taking the midnight trainYou get a free house with your free subscription! *Does not include pipes or wiring.Yeah the compression is so shitty any dark scene gets completely destroyed. I though it was because my vpn cause im watching from Canada but the VPN does 20MB/sWow, the word DIVX feels so ancient now. I've grown old.I watch a lot of south park and other cartoon type shows tbh so makes a lot more sense why I probably never really noticed it.Haha same, I actually wish I bought an used, top of the line ish 1080p TV instead of a cheap 4K.Theres something called a preroll. Advertisers/brands arent retarded and expect you to sit through a 30 second ad.

They have the brand to sell you the company and ads are there to remind you of that brand.

3-5 seconds of a person who is familiar with a brand is plenty of time needed for an advertiser to get their point across.

Even better if you have the ad running in the background while you dick around on your phone because once in a while, even those people look up.

Edit: you’re underestimating what a huge revenue stream this will be for netflix. It makes sense now why they spent billions on original programming and it was to develop their user base for this eventual move.

Netflix with ads is TV on demand.ya sistas assas i said, it's only a matter of time until they impact the subscriber experience. right now it doesn't. when it does, i'm unsubscribing. 

this is pretty much separate from how it impacts their stock price, because people like me are in the minority. you can probably expect their stock price to go up. i just won't be a user anymore -- but since i like money, i'll still play with the stock.i remember i signed up for the free trial for pandora premium. I still got ads every once in a while. Talked to tech support and they said it was a glitch and it "wont happen very often". cancelled immediately.Not as better as yo mum

I'm still shocked Hulu is able to charge and display ads and people pay for it.  Insane.Did you make sure that all your devices and router point to your Pi for DNS?Speculation:
The problem might be that YT is pushing ads to you from their own domain which bypasses the pi-hole since pi-hole blocks specific ad-based DNS.
The same thing happened with Twitch a while ago.
Twitch pushes ads from their own DNS rather than a blocked DNS. This makes the pi-hole fairly useless when it come to blocking ads on Twitch.

Edit: clarityThey could potentially put Fox movies exclusively on Hulu. Right now the big Fox movies from last fall: Ad Astra, Terminator Dark Fate and Ford v Ferrari are all on HBO Max. Not sure how that makes sense.i can totally see, its always sunny in philidelphia, being on disney+ before 10/25/22. And ill bet $50 if you give me 5:1 odds.losing showsIf Spotify wants to go into streaming movies and TV they should buy A24 before Amazon or Apple gets them. What are they going to do with Hulu if they don’t get content with it?I’m not familiar with Hulu, they aren’t a big thing in Germany. This was just my pet theory about NetflixWhat did you expect me to have as proof? Internally leaked emails from the Netflix CEOs conspiring to do this? This is just common business practice and not a far fetched idea. It is basically what all supermarkets are doing. They realised that they can make more profit when they add their own product lines, manufactured by others, instead of traditional brands. They still have to carry some traditional brands for customer recognition.“South Detroit” doesn’t even exist outside of that Journey song. Detroit is an East-West city.But houses are mad cheap tho ...Can’t have shit in Detroit smhI had a top off the line OLED Samsung from back when OLED was new. It busted and I tried to fix it. Damn thing cost me $1300 8 or so years ago. Now I’ve got a kid so it’s $400 TVs for a while.You still have to explain why is the scenario better compared to the 90s or the pre-smartphone era.

Even allowing for the stuff that you said, and the various tricks to make sure that you are generally aware of what is going on on the big screen....still the business is suffering compared to the pre-smartphone era, when TV was the only game in town for advertisers.

Digital ads expense in on the rise, and TV ad expense is nosediving.

What Netflix seems to be aiming for is essentially TV ads. Theyìd look like TV ads, and feel like TV ads. Only they run on AWS but that doesn't matter for the consumer.Spotify is the shit. Never heard an adI did, and according to my unifi firewall rules, and my piholes metrics it seems to all be using the Pihole but still have those Hulu commercials on the smart TV ¯\_(ツ)_/¯Yeah, that's what I read in the beginning of this year as well.Ypu can only get Hulu in Germany with a vpn. so German Netflix has alot of stuff that Hulu would have here. The German Netflix has a better catalogue in my opinionStatistical data would help… I didn’t ask forProof just Facts... and the fact that you take it so personally likely means you have vested interest in the stock going down ...Downriver Detroit might disagree.Yeah, but you have to live in Detroit...I love using this line whenever people talk about cheap ass houses in Kansas or whatever shitty citySure.

Pre 90s / smart phone / internet vs today having a million different streaming services.

These streaming services wont all last. Netflix was first to market and others followed.

Its anyones guess who will survive but there will be consolidation within the space because the average consumer isnt going to pay $30 a month for your dicky service just to watch that one show you have.

Netflix is expanding internationally and off the top of my head, is probably the only streaming service that could pull this move off at this moment.

Digital ad expense is rising because thats where the viewers are and netflix is a digital platform...

Ad revenue is what prevented netflix from truly hitting that next level. I didnt give a shit about them until this.I just realised that this is r/stocks

Seriously don’t read this as emotional or anything. I could be totally wrong, but I would be surprised if I were. Maximising profits is their business. Paying a shit ton of royalties hurts the bottom line. By swapping the content slowly to self-made content, you can maximise profits without having to increase the top line.

Again, this isn’t me speculating on Netflix or anything. This is just me chewing the fat.Yeah, but you get Netflix..You think you're going to live?> Digital ad expense is rising because thats where the viewers are and netflix is a digital platform...

Digital=mobile. Digital=Customized ad.

Watching Netflix with ads on your TV only changes the type of cable you connect to it. Ethernet Cat5 in lieu of cable.

It doesn't change how you experience an ad.

When an ad shows on your phone or on your PC you have nowhere to go, when an ad shows on your TV as you are watching Netflix you can always fall back on your phone.

Netflix is only digital if you consider digital the infrastructure which powers it (AWS) , but it's not digital as far as the experience for the consumer who has to sit there and watch the ad. That would be essentially the same as watching TV today.

Plus I can't see how they'd customize the ads, as they know nothing about your purchasing preferences, except the stuff you watch, whereas Google knows that you'll crave chocolate even before you.

Amazon Video, should they decide to go that route are much better positioned, at least they only face the mobile distraction problem, but they can serve you personalized ads all the way.Not saying are wrong....Legitimately asking for something to back up what you say ... still not sure how Royalties are paid when so many views can be had by a payment of roughly $8.00 or whatever ... if you can explain that to me then please  let me know because nobody seems to have an answer for that...Yeah but you have to see commercialsDude what the fuck are you talking about? Are you fucking retarded?

LolWell royalties (afaik) are kind of like "renting" the movie for a certain region from the original owner, with a negotiated right for redistribution (depending on multiple conditions). I don't think it works likes a movie theater were it is negotiated per ticket sold (in this case this would be per stream or maybe per streamed minute?) but a simply right to offer the movie as part of their portfolio.

There is also not a single form (so to speak) how to negotiate the terms or lengths of such a lease. I think this is where lawyers can really go crazy. There must be dozens of different types to settle something like this. A smaller movie studio might sell an unlimited usage package to Netflix while the larger ones (with more leveraging power) might go for system that are based per streamed minute or whatever.

I'd love to give you more data on this but as I said. This is just my pet theory because it makes a lot of sense and I can see that in most other industries happening (Amazon selling Amazon Basics Stuff or also producing their own shows for example).Trick question, no internet available.I remember buying this around 470 then sold at a loss during crash and got scared too when musk was called to testify on court..Guess Elon's twitter profile picture was a hint about the shorts after all.I bought 8 shares of TSLA at around 300. During the pandemic, I watched it drop, and wondered everyday if I should hold it or not. I stayed with it... best decision of my life lmaoHoly shit they've been profitable for a year! I can no longer dismiss quarterly profits, but still am so much further from investing because it's an animal orgy. SFX.V to the moon.She’s going to 1800 during after hours today lolI bought 40 shares of TSLA at 240 and got scared and sold all of it at 720.  I felt like an idiot because my plan all along along was to hold for at least 20 years.  Just bought back in today at 1575.  Gonna stock to my original plan and hold long because I believe there is a fundamental change in energy production/consumption taking place world wide and Tesla is positioned to dominate the market.  

To the moon and beyond!!!Those who said "don't buy TSLA at $361 (on March 18th).  It's a shit stock and hasn't made any money".  FU!  I bought 10 shares at $361.  Face.Well this did not age wellI’m so pumped 🚀This didnt age well...My impression: revenue attributable to cars flat for more than a  year. Revenue from solar negligible and flat. Shrinking market share for EV in Europe. Cutting prices. Without the credits no profit past half year. No autonomous cars. Positive seems the increased margins.

Regarding the new factories (sorry, #GIGAFACTORIES): supply will go up with 2-3 new factories. If demand does follow than Tesla will be producing mass market vehicles with probably a lower margin. What to do with these factories when demand flattens/drops, how do other car manufacturers handle this? I know BMW contracts external companies for some of their cars.

EDIT: regarding storage Tesla seems to offer competition, but Tesla is certainly not the only company here! Google Nextera or Fluence for example. Regarding MWs installed from solar power it doesn't amount to much compared to projects from Shell for example, which funds renewable energy projects with gigawatts of energy.More a matter of when. Not if.Dude I remember buying Tesla back in early 2019 when it was still around 250$ man time flys.Still think this is a huge gamble. Reality is going to catch up with Tesla at some point.If this were any other company, it would be a 'sell the news' event and the stock would tumble 5% today.Not a hater, although sold my stock when it was about $1200. Idk, it just looks like the rise isn’t substantiated and purely based on hype/ RobinHood nowadays. V risky IMOEligible doesn't mean it will. And if they do get included it will likely be September if they do it at end of quarter rebalance.It was one of the first shares I bought in March when I jumped into the market. I bought at $420 (nice) and promptly sold for $500 for a quick $80 profit!! Woo hoo!!!

This could be a tale of woe, but dont worry, I bought back in at 700 and still holding ;)Overpriced as fuck already, but probably. People have forgotten about fundamentals. I don’t care if it goes to $10k. I’m not buying it again until it is fairly and justifiably priced.Trust in Elon SanLet the good times roll. Like I told y'all, don't listen to Reddit 4% YoY returns shitty advice. Invest in technology w/ proper research.Will TSLA in the sp500 cause crazy volatility now in SPY?Gay bears mad. Invested at $1496 on Monday. Let’s gooooo  THANK YOU PAPA ELONI'm going to make a fortune shorting this nonsense. But not tomorrow.God i hope not cause when it crashes it i'll blow up the SP500 along with it.Just because they are eligible does not mean that they will be added. Keep in mind this is a stock that has seen 250%+ growth YTD. It is considered to be extremely volatile. Not every company that meets the criteria to be added is added and I think TSLA will be another example of that.I bought at 600 and sold at 1400. I’m still waiting to buy it at a reasonable price, I’ll probably still be waiting 5 years from now.So many ifs, but, maybes in here. If you sold at profit, take it. If you sold at loss, that’s a shame. None of you could have predicted the future. Don’t regret anything you did.Is it ultimate fomo to buy stocks now?"The S&P bump isn’t really a thing
Companies do typically see a short term uptick in value, but “this price effect is largely temporary and reverses gradually after the inclusion,” professor Maria Kasch told the WSJ. 

The data backs it up: Of the 10 companies added to the S&P this year, only five have outperformed the broader index.
But if we've learned one thing, rules don't really apply to Tesla. Shares rose about 4% after hours."I wore my buckle but it never flies to 1800Tesla will be the Apple of autonomous driving and electrical vehicles. Meaning there will be a lot of competition but none will compare.1800??? Atleast 1900 it’s already at 1740 🚀🚀🚀🚀Yeah really excited for tomorrow, bought 1 Tesla stock 2 days ago for 1600. I'm a beginner, so feel free to tell your opinion on this move :)

Btw, I'm aiming to sell at 1800/1850 on the sort term (was hoping for the Q2 profit)What's Tesla P/E gonna be now? Asking for a friend.What other EV companies are worth the long term investment? NIO?I've made 316% profit on my Tesla stock 😳My dad bought 57 shares of TSLA at $45. Sold end of 2019 for around 250. I begged him to buy again mid march when it went sub 400 and he wouldn’t listen :(ByAnd I was called an idiot for not selling @ 1600, by not one, but multiple people.Can't waitNicely done!quick question, How long would it take for a company to be put in the S&P 500?I remember the day it released at $25/share and a dude that lived in my apartment complex told me about it. I could barely make rent back then though living in LA. :(Damn it Schwab why won't you let me buy fractional shares of TSLAVolkswagen, BMW and Toyota stocks are flat for the past 52wk. Their glory days may not be over but are on hold for now. Tesla is the new darling. Tesla is the future.Tesla is a really good company and it has a lot of potential. Watch this! [Should you buy Tesla stocks?](https://youtu.be/FAliEZs0VaI)It's only at $1500 because people believe it will get 4 quarter of profit. Expecting it to be in sp500. Fair value is $1000ish. Everyone that thinks it will go higher is late to the party. Look at all the recent insider trades...all sells.I bought 20 for $279ea in 2019. Immediately dropped to $200. Held on. 

I think that dip gave me the courage to hodl everything thru the Corona turmoil with just a bit of swing trading. 

Paid off! $7.5k into 45k    ($cad)Anyone else waiting for the bubble to pop? I say Tesla lands and rests at 30.Make sure you use protection with
Elon tonightDon't worry, it's not a bubble.I have heard somewhere that inclusion of S&P 500 is not necessarily an all-good thing?I bought 10 stocks  @ 1570 couple days ago and sold it at1621 yesterday after I heard the devaluation for j.p. Morgan. I chicken outbut what about the tax credits propping up profits?I buy a shitload of total market index funds every month. 

Makes me sad that I don’t buy independent stock as part of my hold never sell portfolio. 

But whatever I’m in my 20’s and still learning. :(It's going to be interesting to see **if** they will be included in the s&p500. Tesla would be like, the 4th largest company in there? The index value would immediately jump 5% or more causing all sorts of disruptions as the index funds need to rebalance.Lmao if this doesnt SCREAM Elon fudges the books i dont know what does.    Anyone who has this shit better sell before it all comes crashing down one dayNot touching Tesla ever at this valuation. Overvalued garbage. I'll see people will lose their shirt soon. Half of FB/BABA market cap but making shit money compare to them. I'm stupid but not that stupid lmao.Tesla will be bankrupt by 2025. Totally unsustainable business model.Imagine it not being included.... Ya never know :DI got in for 5 shares at $99 lol.

Then 5 shares at 234.

Then 8 shares at 339.

Then 6 shares at 1500.

In all I got up to 40 shares. I have sold 15. 

Can you imagine if I wasn't such a bitch at $99? 

Return at +1500%!

And I still feel like a bitch for selling those 15. Rationally I know to just let it all ride because Tesla is special. But part of me just wanted to make sure I got something  out of it JUST IN CASE. lol.Price target: $3400Buy the rumor, sell the newsMy dad bought 80 shares at $60 and sold at $120 so don’t feel too badRipI bought at like 430 during the crash, sold at 1000. I only bought 1 share though lol. Still awesome profitweak hands leads to weak gainsLiterally sameYou were not crazy to do that, no one could have predicted this meteoric rise.Congrats!Bought total of 11 stocks last year at around $230 avg. Sold 5 at 250, 3 at 330 and 3 at 750 

Could have earnt like 17k if i held...Enjoying this moment, right? Well done!I bought 20 @ 279. Immediately dropped to low-200s (mid-2019)

Now? 5k to 32k in 2 years. 

Plus I’m Canadian so that’s like $50k in Monopoly money.It's core business is not profitable. It only made money due to "regulatory credits". It hasn't actually made money on making cars yet. As other companies make electrics (a lot are coming out), then there is no more "regulatory credit" income for Tesla.You know you have a gambling problem when you refer to a stock as a ‘She’ lolNoThis aged like milkIt’s literally around $1500I bought one share at 950 wish I bought 2 I’m still holding my one share lolI bought 8 shares at 1k. Eveyone tried to stop me and said that the stock was about to drop ;)Why is their revenue flat for last 6 quarters? Why is 25% of their sales in accounts receivable when they take cash on delivery?I feel ya. Sound just like me. I had the same plan.Why do you think they are going dominate the market? As far as I can tell they have no plans to make an affordable low range car to compete with Toyota, Ford, etc. They are a luxury brand?I think a lot of people (like me) are in the same boat. We all felt like 700 was insane and panic sold :(There will be increased competition for Tesla in the next 5-10 years. It will be harder to convince people to stay loyal.To Mars most likely!would I be crazy to buy in today? I can probably only swing one or two shares but at this point IdkBe careful with the buying here.  You will get another buy chance closer to 1k at some point this year.Have you sold?Buy low sell high.Just like TSLAGo see my post about tesla being overvalued at 900$ in may. This one aged like raw meat$TSLA fliesPeople have been saying that since the days when it was $420 a share.Thought the exact same.  But looking pre market it looks like we might both be wrong.

Up $88 pre market.

Versus MSFT with some nice results and down pre market.

Humans are so much fun in their irrational behavior.   Without life would be so boring.Eligible means there is a very high probability of it being included. Apparently lots of indexes were already trying to buy shares a few days agoHappy cake dayCareful, that is apparently crazy talk.What would you say is the fair price for $TSLA? Also, agreed.No. It will make up a tiny portion of it.Why do you think it would have any significant impact on 499 unrelated companies?I bought putts at $1770 and got out at $1540... Gay bear much...I also invested on monday at 1496 TWINSIESLol, tesla crashing wouldn't bring the whole s&p down with itIf I were you I’d ask for a refund!RemindMe 2 monthsWhere are you getting 1740 from google saying 1593 to meThis is like an auction now. ANYONE FOR 5000?!!?? 6000 COMING RIGHT ON... ITS GONNA GO 10K in 2 YEARS!!?!. ... Sell it whilst u can or I'll regret ityou must be dreaming. it's not even 1700 nowPeople’s opinion are all over the place when it comes to Tesla, some people were saying that if you bought any time recently you were wasting money because it was going to plummet to ~1000/share.

Personally I have a similar plan as you, I bought two stocks around $1600 to see what happens, I was planning to sell around $1800 too but now I’m thinking I’ll sell one and keep one and see if it can make the S&P 500.Be aware historically it’s taken a couple of weeks before the idiots on wall street understand the numbers and the stock price goes up. They have to read the analysts reports and discuss it with their friends.No its mostly overvalued, look into another sectorBuy into stable car companies with solid business models that are moving into the space.ouch.Laughing with my .09 shares of tesla. LolLmaoooooid say around 500-70020+ % of the outstanding shares traded would have to be bought up by funds that track the s&p500.yeah... not a good thing if you are a 🌈🐻500 bucks profit not bad dude. we don't know the future. I'm holding in tight for the long haul but I don't know about the next few weeks. I did the same dropping zoom at $150 and now it's much more than that.Don’t gamble dudeLast 5 yrs: spy ~50% | msft over 300%Why *wouldn't* they be included? Is S&P gonna wait until they hit a trillion in market cap and then add them?Interesting hypothesis, care to share your research? 😏Its not like we have laws in place that would stop that from happening.sorry for your loss, gb.  ROFLMAO🤡It’ll prob get a stock split because this is ridiculous and I own 40 shares lol.AgreedYour actions show the opposite..Damn. $4800 then to $144,000 tomorrow if OP is right.

&#x200B;

Still goes to show how get rich quick with holding stocks is just not possible. That's what, probably 8 years just to make $140,000? WSB could make negative $140,000 in one weekYou can buy back in - your dad knows this right? I’ve been buying from 200 to 1600The person above lost money and your dad made money. That would make them feel bad right?i remember my friend's dad giving him like 50+ shares at around $18.... to which my friend then sold around $35 thinking he was a great trader...You could totally get a couple of hookers and some blow for $570.I still have my 1 share. Bought in early 600s now imma ride out till the end100% gain isn’t weak hands dog.  You take profit whenever and wherever.  An investor has no time to regret and daydream.  GTFOH, it’s about making money, not holding on to things till they dead.  I sold google at 300.  I also haven’t sold stocks that ended up making me comfortable.Except for the long-term investors in the company, of which there are a lot of.It’s that “could have” that makes me make future bad plays.I did basically the exact same thing at about the same prices.  Bought at 230.  Figured the market was all over the place and it would be awesome if I could by my future Cybertruck exclusively with TSLA stock.

Sold most of mine at 400 and planned to buy them & more back the next time Trump said some dumb shit and tanked things.  Then the rest at 750.  It's never gone back down.  I am so sad.  I had planned to hold for the long run, even arguing with friends about why I was doing it.  Stupid short-sighted idea cost me big.

I bought 1 share for a lot more money just to own on principle. 😢Could you point me to a reliable article or anything where I can read more about their regulatory credits?I’m pretty confident those cyber trucks are a beeline for military contractsThey actually made money even if you subtract credit revenue, to prove a point, that they are still in full growth reinvesting mode and purposefully limit their profit to the minimum investors need to see to prove the company can do it. They spend the rest of the revenue on growth. 

Look at their factory and automation investments in their financials. It's all in plain sight. Your conspiracy is to help you cope with FOMO.AMZN did the same for almost a decade: run at < 1% margin and invest everything in growth. You must see that with another gigafactory location confirmed (Austin) and Musk saying the factory is the product, not the car there is huge margins in there once they finish building factories.No surprise here, they are building one Giga factory after another. This is a growing company. Wait 4 years where everything cumulateShows they are light years ahead of the competition.https://youtu.be/Fo-L4GfstaQ?t=1966They get reg credits for every car they produce. It's not like they get the credits merely because they're an EV manufacturer. The more cars they produce, the more credits they get. That's why the selling of reg credits is registered as automotive revenue. So yes, this is part of their core business. They earn money by selling the car itself, and it's regulatory credits & get paid by their competitors. It's perfect.Tesla earns Regulatory credits for each EV they sell, so YES those are parts of the profits Tesla gets per car. The more cars Tesla sells the more credits Tesla earns (which farther boosts their profits due to the demand for the credits). The government isn't simply handing a fixed amount of Tesla to do whatever they want with.

The other auto-makers consider regulatory credits part of the profit of their EV's to, because it helps them avoid massive fines.> As other companies make electrics (a lot are coming out)

Where are they??  No other EV can compare to even a 2012 Model S.  They've had 8 years FFS and it's still  "coming soon.."She’s a thing of beauty🎳It’s over $1600~1670 right now. Weirder things could happen.It’s close to $1700I have one share too. I missed buying another in April at 400 cause I forgot to set a reminder and it shot up the next day. I didn’t have enough in my account to buy it and just assumed it would go back down lolSell your car, house, wife and kids and buy more tomorrow. Tesla to the moon.good shit boy. I bought 0.7 shares at 1496 so we'll see if i get fuckedWow such winky face you are a fucking god for guessing a 50/50 right be my daddyThey had record revenue last year. There is a pandemic going on this year if you are not aware. You might not understand that they sell/deliver everything they are able to. They need to build more factories to be able to sell more cars. There are production constraints for the demand they have. They will show record revenue again this year during a pandemic.Musk has stated that his long term goal is to create the most affordable electric vehicles, and I believe that he actually wants to do that.  We all know that Tesla would have been destroyed if they entered the market with anything that wasn’t S3XY and luxurious.  They have created a solid brand and they will now be able to gradually create more affordable models without killing the brand.  

Just my opinion.And you know this how....?It's definitely overvalued today. That said Tesla will fully grow into its valuation. But I would not catch a falling knife. Grab SOLO or BLNK instead.IMO that ship has sailedZero chance.Yeah, but at this price you are basically speculation that they will come out with some life-changing technology. I guess people see it as a tech company and hope they deliver. If they do it all respect to them. The Elon cult can only bring them so far.TSLA intraday swings are worth more than the entire market cap of a profitable (20x of TSLA revenue) car company trading at 14x P/E (Fiat FCAU)

Perhaps Fiat should spin off a "energy platform, AI tech, EV" company and subsidize it through HEVs to NIO, NKLA, and TSLA levels of capitalization! 

Very short and very salty today.It's a momentum stock, that's all. Speculation fuels more speculation pushing the stock higher and creating more confirmination bias, it's a loop no point betting against it. Until it crashes :)thanks!bUT yOuR mIsSinG oUt BrO h8tEr😂900-1100You do know spy doesn’t have exactly 500 companies right?yessirrrr You holding for how long? What are your thoughts? I'm probably here for the LONG haul (5-10yrs)Now kissYou can actually work it out  a 50% drop would take \~0.5% off of the S&P500 annual growth. That’s why most trackers probably couldn’t care less what price it is on the day it is included, they will just buy it at that.I will be messaging you in 2 months on [**2020-09-23 13:43:29 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2020-09-23%2013:43:29%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hw1jy1/tesla_posts_4th_consecutive_profit_its_now/fyz95yg/?context=3)

|-|-|-|-|Look at the after hours numbersNice to hear you have the same plan! I'm thinking of selling around 1800 and buying back if it drops below 1500, cuz it's probably going to drop again if it hits 1800.If you buy TSLA and MSFT you buy stocks.
If you only buy TSLA you buy a share, or two shares. You don’t buy one stock of TSLA.Ah okay, but I won't sell with losses. Good chance it'll get above 1600 at least on the conclusion within the s&p500 and otherwise after battery day.Sometimes companies issue more shares when being included.  Why don’t you think Tesla will issue more shares?Colorful... animal.....


....rainbo...w... bear.... 


WHaT iS tHiS mAd MaN sAyInGI own shares of Tesla bruh 😒Factor capital gain tax to that profitThe purpose of the SP500 is to present a broad representation of the overall US market, not to serve a couple megacorps. There are many other large and successful companies not in the index.

With that said, the S&P is a private company, they can do whatever they like. The current market cap of the index is 24T so you have that sort of pressure on them, making sure nothing drastic happens. They are going to think twice before pissing off 24T of money.The number of idiots who can't look at the numbers and see this is insaneIt was worth 211 less than a year ago. 800% returns in a year could get you rich pretty quickly8 years just to make 140k ... lol. “Just” 140k as if it’s nothing. That’s around 16k a year probably half the average salary, it’s like a free side job.Well this just makes it worse. I talked to him today he actually said it was 180 shares not 80.Yeah he thinks it’s overvalued thoughYeah trueFactsThat’s a win-win in my books.This is the waylol you sold google at 300100% gain is pretty weak compared to my 600% gains in TSLA.

Also, the dude above actually sold TSLA at a loss, so that just proves my point weak hands = weak gains.That's why you need to do research so you know if a stock is getting overvalued, or if it still has tremendous growth potential in the long term despite it's stock getting on the expensive side.That is so sad 😭 sorry to hear man. I panic-sold all 20 for like $600 during corona. I’d bought them a for $279ea. 

20 minutes later I bought em all back for like $605 each. Cheap mistake (~$100) and now I just hodl it.https://www.ft.com/content/2a4a8680-77ad-40e0-985f-7c153e6717baRegulatory credits are available to all automakers. They're called Zev credits. Other automakers would rather pay Tesla than build EVs that people want to buy. 

This is the market and TSLA is innovating while other companies are paying rent. 

It's retarded.Or police carsMars trucksNot at all.  EVs are a joke for military use since the supply chain is so specific and so fragile.No they didn't. They would be at a 300M loss.Investments are for future growth, which Tesla has been chasing since 2010. 10 years and still no profitability with their main business line. 

The fact is that Tesla may never be profitable but it does not matter because of FOMO. People are not buying Tesla because of the underlying business but the fact that it keeps going up no matter what.

And that growth reinvestment mode is BS. They have been in that mode for a decade with no results as a public company. 

Fact is Tesla is a speculative stock with a bad business model. After 10 years they have lost their competitive advantage in autonomous electrical vehicles. And as other car companies release similar vehicles at lower prices because they have their supply chain figures out already you will see Tesla numbers go down. But not the stock priceTrueeeeThe difference being that Amazon did grow revenue 20%-40% yoy every quarter, while Tesla's revenue hasn't been growing for 5-6 quarters now.Except their EV market shAre in Europe has dropped 70%There are tons I cannot even keep track. There must be 10+ coming to the US / Europe and even more coming to China. The great thing about electric vehicles is they are much simpler to make than ICE vehicles so once a manufacturer decides to make it, then it is very easy for them. Here are the two I have my eye on:

https://www.nissanusa.com/ariya.html

https://www.ford.com/suvs/mach-e/2021/

It is safe to say a flood of electric vehicles are coming over the next 18 months. The market will be practically saturated with them.Always liked the Shag-uar I pacewe @ 17 rnIt's stuck around 1657 now. +4.06%fuuuuckkkk same for me. I saw it at 700 around that time and thought it was too expensive. FMLI also only have one share, just wanted to part of the change to sustainability well lets just hope he does a stock split 20:1 and then still rockets to $20K in 10 years.Ive been doing this for a long time.  It may take sometime, but eventually TSLA will sell down.  Im incredibly bullish long term for TSLA, but the markets go up and down... 

You will get another good buy opportunity here.NiceI personally do not see it with TSLA.  But I have owned Amazon for well over a decade now and heard how overvalued much of the time.

All proven incorrect.  So I am careful to say bad things about TSLA.

I personally just avoid because it makes no sense to me.   Guess it does to others.

Perfect example is this morning.   TSLA is text book buy on rumor and sell on news.  Yet look at how far up this morning.Ha!   Momentum stocks are still subject to buy on rumor and sell on news.

We will see what happens today.  But pre market is now $65 and down from $88.

It could easily end up down today.I didn't know that. What's the deal there?It has 505I’m waiting to see what happens tomorrow and the next several days and gauge my plan of action from there. But I agree, Tesla in 5-10 years is going to be INSANEWhat are you a 🌈🐻?Wouldn't it be less  than 0.5%? And even in the almost impossible scenario that it does happen, its barely anything hahaProbably huh?Once it gets above 1600, sell it and don't look back.Bay gearUsually when a company joins S&P 500 it goes up quite a bit and then goes right back down after a couple of months.What other large successful American public companies are not in the index?

Again, there's no reason not to include Tesla, if you include everyone else around the same market size.The problem is they're looking at a car manufacturer with the lens of analyzing a company like Amazon. Tesla primarily sells cars. They sell about 1.3% of cars and they aren't known for manufacturing margin. 

So what's the speculation? That governments will subsidize EVs even more in the future? That all other EVs will have poor demand despite massive customer loyalty and ingrained advantages like parts, repair, and distribution? 

I honestly don't know what the speculation is based on. They can't sell regulatory credits forever when other car companies will be getting the credits too.If you bought TSLA instead of the Model X in 2015..    

Model X in 2015 - $100,000ish (Google, no incentives included.)    

If invested in TSLA in 2015 - $626,000ish    

Potato - TomatoJuly 15, 2019 I begged everyone I knew to buy Tesla. It was ~$230. And here we areI bought 500 at $330 a couple months back. Almost sold at 750 ish. Gonna hold until next year.Yeah from one of the luckiest investments you could make in your life. Barely any companies, if any, have had the upward trajectory of Tesla in such a short time. 

That’s not a free side job, that’s amazingly good fortuneThere is absolutely zero chance anyone can reliably and remotely accurately predict where Tesla stock is going.Maybe but if you look at their specs, they’re bigger than normal, angular (possibly to help with radar deflection?), shapes like a humvee, & supposedly bullet proof. If I were to guess the civilian trucks are to fund the manufacturing lines so they can produce military grade vehicles at a very low costOr props on Robo Cop 7.A wedge truck is too niche for any kind of civilian use outside of countries like IsraelI feel like I read this exact take about Amazon 10 years ago.Mate you do know they are competing against automotive companies which most are around 100 years old. Look at their cagr of around 50% a year and now calculate how many cars they will sell in 2030. Big Auto is still easily 3 years behind in producing BEVs at the level that Tesla does. Now look at margins and you‘ll also see that Tesla has insanely good margins too. 
If you actually believe in Tesla‘s growth story (and u dont have to, just like u dont have to buy that stock) you can actually see how 1500$ would be quite cheap for 5-10 years out. 
And if things like Robotaxis actually work out and the energy business that allegedly is supposed to one day be bigger than their automotive business, then 1500$ is going to be a steal for one share of that company.Tesla grew revenue from 25 million in 2008 to 25 BILLION in 2019.

That's a 1000x multiplier in 10 years.You will see revenue grow when they can run both Freemont and Shanghai again. As well as the increase in capacity for the expansion in both Shanghai and in Berlin. Then on top of that they are expanding their facility in Sparks Nevada for the semi. And now they announced they will build a Terra factory in Austin TX.

You can simply not cherry pick a specific set of months and say there is no growth. Especially not during forced shutdowns.Good luck with that😂Will be $1800 in the coming weeksIt was too expensive. Tesla isn’t fairly priced. It’s priced based on pure speculation.Is there a "one-share-holders" club? I'll join you guys!It’s crazy how many people on reddit know exactly what price a given stock will go toCheers. No way to know where this is goingLook at spy or any index fund on your brokerage site, and it will tell you how many stocks are included in it and what percent of the index’s value are accounted for by its top 10 stocks. E.g. SPY currently has 506 holdings, and its top 10 stocks account for 27.33% of its value

Could have worded it better but hope that makes senseLook at spy or any index fund on your brokerage site, and it will tell you how many stocks are included in it and what percent of the index’s value are accounted for by its top 10 stocks. E.g. SPY currently has 506 holdings, and its top 10 stocks account for 27.33% of its value



Could have worded it better but hope that makes senseWhy?I know of SNAP and Lululemon, but if you want to find out more I suggest you try out this new website that appeared yesterday: http://www.google.com

You seemed to have missed that part when I said they need to represent the broad market and also the part where I said there's 24T of money being unhappy with any drastic change in the index.Amazon honestly is a bubble too imoI've done the math on my iPod Video vs. Apple stocks a few times. The opportunity cost of those 240 x 160 px Family Guy episodes is \~500k.Got you beat. In 2011-2012 when TSLA was about $20-30 I told everyone this is the next stock. I was a broke college student so I didn't have anything to invest in my name. Told my dad, all my friends, everyone who I could talk to. Then it started going up $50, $75, $100, etc but no one jumped in. Here we are now.I bought at 725, added more when dipped to 680 only couple of months ago and sold at 860!
I bought back again at 1400, sold some and holding......Begging everyone I know to buy NIO.What else are you begging people to buy nowThat’s a cool story and all but Tesla never dropped that low this year. Closest it got was $361 on 3/18BSCongrats on the early retirementDamn son. That's a fuck ton of money.Wouldn't Cybertruck require special equipment to charge? I'm not really sure how much power electric vehicles require to charge.Also they are way more quiet than a combustion car.They're smaller than the Raptor, radar doesn't work on ground vehicles, they're not shaped like a HMMV and modern design favors a V hull to deflect IED blasts to the sides rather than up into the cabin, it's supposedly bulletproof to a 9mm which doesn't mean much when your enemy is firing 7.62x39 or 7.62x54, they would still need to be up-armored and you'd need to find space in the doors to fit thicc bulletproof glass, and most importantly, there's not usually a lot of reliable electricity sources in the middle of a warzone, nor are they inclined to wait around for an hour to charge up while the enemy is moving/attacking/retreating or suffering from reduced range in cold climates. Military vehicles are specced out to accept multiple fuel inputs, e.g. diesel engines will also burn kerosene, both of which are likely to be readily available from supply trains, are stable, transportable, don't care about temperature and transfer quickly.It made sense to invest in Amazon 10 years ago. They didn’t have the same presence they have now, but they definitely had a significant tangible presence. Amazon was also profitable 10 years ago, and they had a vision for a clear path forward.


Tesla doesn’t meet any of these criteria, and its current value is honestly artificial. Competitive edge with autonomous vehicles lost. Company hasn’t been truly profitable in 10 years. I know no one who owns a Tesla or has any intention to buy one. In my area of the country, I rarely see a Tesla on the road. There’s just no way its valuation makes sense.“If you believe Tesla growth story” 

That’s the issue. You are ignoring 10 years worth of data for some hope in the future that Tesla can be worth more than Disney. Amazon was growing 40%Yoy but Tesla numbers have be stagnant for years now, even before the corona virus. 

The fact is a 300b 10 year old company made 100m in 3 months. None of those numbers make any sort of senseMore supply doesnt mean more demand2k in coming weeks possiblyAt the end of the day we're all gambling.My point is to be patient as I don’t think now is the time to buy.Since when does the S&P have 506 companies? Everything I'm finding says 505

Edit: I just saw that SPY has 506 for some reason, but the S&P has 505Its too overvalued even for growth stocksSNAP hasn't generated four consecutive quarters of profits.

Lululemon isn't an American company.

Next.Yes, but still deserved of being the market leader. I sold my Amazon shares at $2700.Never expected $3100Told my mom to buy some at $200 but she read an article that said they were overvalued and got scared 🤦‍♂️

I bought some when I could and did quite well but rip.That’s insaneBought in between $2-4. Happily taking profits on the ride up.NIO is going to crash.  They don’t have anything compared to tsla.Dude, I sold exactly on this day. It was impulsive sell, I still got nice profit but damn I messed up. Later I doubled on TLRY and sold that as well and now I only wish I held the shares till now. I would have 2 times as what is in my account now, but it's still not a zero balance :)Typo on my part.... $430*.Just level 2 chargers. They run about $1k each to install at a residence. The Cybertruck’s battery is just one of their 100kwh packs iirc. 

Tesla has made massive gains in efficiency that no one else can really match. Efficiency is so useful when driving and when charging so it pays double.ok boomerIn what way have Tesla‘s numbers been stagnant for years now?Sure we don't know the full demand yet. But supply constraint means revenue constraints. Increasing the supply will increase the potential to more revenue.Wouldn’t doubt it!Yeah, don’t. Do research. Pick companies based on good leaders and stable growth.My bad meant to post this reply to another comment.

My brokerage shows 506 holdings for spy and I assume my brokerage has good dataYeah but the good news of yesterday can have the potential to bring the stock up to 1800 right?>Next.

I see you still haven't figured out how to use Google :(They still are overvalued in comparison to other auto manufacturers. Their p/e is 30+, I believe, while Ford for example is sub-3how much did you buy and have you sold?Ok broYes what I’m worried about more than the chargers is the charging infrastructure. Can we afford to use limited electricity in combat zones on electric vehicles?Lol I mean if you consider me a boomer at 27.


I just choose to not sink my money into a black hole that seemingly generates money. Just doesn’t give me a lot of confidence.Since 2018 q1 name a quarter that Tesla has shown growth past the 5-6b revenue rangeNot necessarily, too much supply would reduce revenue but only to an extent though i dont think that will ever be the case. I think demand would be low pnce corona clears and economjc impacts of the global economy surfaces. The entire market right now is speculative and we might see another crash. If we dont, demand would still be low for another year at least which might slow growth - it would definetly grow. But the thing is 1500 is too overvaluedI know. I am confused as to why SPY has 506 companies but the S&P only has 505 in reality.

SPY is not the S&P although it is supposed to mirror it, so I'm wondering why it has an extra company in it's holdings.Maybe for thr short term, but i would generally avoid the stock entirely. 1500rn and at 300B market cap, doesnt justify future growth for at least 10years. EV, battery, ai can only get u so far especially if theres low demand after corona when deep ecnomic impact surfaces. Tsla can only grow so much, i see it below 1000rn probably around 700 tbh but i could be entirelu wrongTesla p/e at 30? Add another zero and you might be getting closeTesla's P/E is over 700 lmfaoHaven’t sold any; I’m longing it.Hell, I might downvote my comment. 
I bought at 8, sold at 3 and watched it climb to 17. 
But honestly, Tesla makes more sense due to their environmental and renewable techI mean honestly the military figures out more complicated logistical problems every day. If they have to they’ll just run diesel generators. For the military there are likely to be applications where EVs make sense and where they don’t. 

I think people get caught up short term in logistical problems too much. I imagine when we switched to ICEs from horses and buggies there were people who said the logistics of that would be impossible and we’d always need horses. What actually happened is we used both for a bit until ICEs were fully superior and the logistics had been completely worked out. It won’t be a total overnight switch but I dare say the logistics are easier than switching from horses to ICEs a ala ww1.If you were 17 ten years ago then you know absolutely nothing about Amazon's "presence" 10 years ago. Your assessment of Tesla is absurd.They might have picked up an additional s&p500 eligible company (e.g tesla) presuming they would be added soonWhy does PE even matter any more?  Things costs what they cost until they don't.So, slightly overvalued then lmao...

Funny part is though, it doesn’t seem to matter to the market and I don’t know whyHmm 25k not bad ehh... started to build a position following the dip today and would continue to do so for a while ...Actually, if you look into any of the recent Army procurement forecasts they are already developing plans for a JLTV-EV (Joint Light Tactical Vechicle, successor to the Humvee) with plans for a near future fleet size of something like 50,000.  

The reason they are pushing this is because they are worried about the logistics of the current Diesel engines as the consumer market moves to electric.  They don’t want to get left behind paying for the increased costs combustion engines and parts once the economies of scale start shifting away from combustion engines.  They also worry about the increased costs of gas once the mega refineries no longer make economic sense.

The Army also has stated that the in the field logistics of powering a electric engine would be much easier than powering a Diesel engine as it’s transporting large tanker ships, planes tanks and trucks is very expensive and dangerous.  After losing so many trucks/drivers to roadside bombs and ambushes in Afghanistan and Iraq, the look forward to being able to use portable power sources such as solar, wind or the local electric grids to charge their fleets in the field...and have been working on portable micro-nuclear reactors to deploy with forward units.  

So they are not looking at electronic vechiles as a logistical problem...they are actually looking at them as a logistical solution.TSLA isn't one of the holdings and it would be irresponsible for them to add something prematurely based on speculation.

I did some digging into it and SPY is counting "US Dollar" as a holding. So there are still only 505 companies in SPY.You're right, in these times nothing makes any fucking sense anyway...CoolYes, a bomb went off in my entire portfolio.Just opened a Roth IRA this afternoon, that’s why.Stocks go up, stocks go down.I should have warned you. I bought some stock this morning. Don’t worry this happens every time.I’d say dropping more than 5% can be considered a small bomb. Today is just a really loud and smelly fart.If you are young you want stocks to go down because that means discount buying!The stock market was lower than it was a couple hours ago.  Get used to it, it happens a bunch.Heard there was a pandemic somewhere. Could have something to do with it.Great day to buy!Surprised we haven't seen more red lately, tbh.

Wasn't that long ago we were tripping circuit breakers and it's not like the world has improved much. If anything, the situation in the US is much worse.Same here just don’t look at ur portfolioSTOCKS JUST ILLEGALLY WENT DOWN

&#x200B;

can you believe this shit?i bought calls for microsoft 🙂😢Next time you decide to go for a walk please give us some heads up so we can close our positions.It's because I finally bought some shares of TSLA, sorry folks.Sentient cheetoh talking about fight with china tradeShits fucked in Asia and Europe right now, Armenia and Azerbaijan are shelling eachother, Greece is on their highest military readiness currently because turkey has sixteen naval vessels in the Mediterranean and China as pulled some shifty shit at their consulate in Houston because they are being evicted on Friday. Over all Asia and Europe are primed for proxy wars it seems like and the Middle East, Egypt, Libya and Iran all seem to high high tension pints right now especially after Egyptian parliament signed off on what is essentially war with Libya over a dam. All of this becoming aggregated into global markets through news and resulting in economic consequences seems to have finally come to a head today that’s my bet. In Other news I have no idea what I’m talking about.[deleted]I’m down in every god damn stock in my portfolio what a dayEveryone calm down, I knew this was coming.

Reason: I bought yesterday.unemployment happenedLook at it as an opportunityI'm asking the same questionStimulus news is over blown. No huge tax cut or just uncertainty. People always get out a day or two before news like this. I personally think we hit a peak for a while. I expect things to fall then go back up. It may implode during afterhours and really shake investers outWell in murica ya got two sides and they both sunk donk, ya got the blue team and ya got the red team.. there’s actually very little difference between the two - except for which voters they brand themselves to.. think 00’s windows vs Apple...

Then ya got the people stuck in between who mainly want to make bank and fuk hookers..

Then you got this here virus runnin round killing people and scaring the whole economy, forcing people to lose their jobs... 

Then you got all those people with no jobs getting paid for having no jobs and more people joining them because the virus is losing their jobs...

Red team and blue team agreed to pay those people with no jobs, which has allowed them to buy stuff pay off their mortgages and keep amzn +ve daily also contributed to wsb traffic. 

People keep getting unemployed at a higher rate this far into the virus which suggest that it’s a bad economy and permanent job losses..

Now all those free tendies those people got are gonna dry up, because red team and blue team are fighting over a new bill, red team says you are paying people not to work, blue team keeps adding shit into the bill to wind red team up.. then man in charge wants a payroll tax cut which nobody cares about.

So basically red team and blue team can’t agree on anything except for the fact they will agree one day, meanwhile in between all those people gettin free tendies ain’t gon get shit near what they getting... and more people are joining them, so nobody can afford to buy iPhones, buy tslas, eat out, buy hookers... YOLO spx 420 calls ...
So none of your stonks will have any income and none of your calls will print, people will take out money from stonks to buy shit, like food and stuff no more yolos...

So until red team and blue team agree??... 
the market is complacent that they will in time... they won’t they think it’s more sporting to damage everyone’s life in the processzIf you’re dumb like me, you just average down. Note that this is almost a guaranteed way to lose money 👍🏿Anyone still holding AMZN, Tesla or APPL should have expected thisUnemployment number posted as well.It was all hinging on the Washington Football Team namingDon't see red days as a problem. All red days mean is DISCOUNT buys. Green days are Sell/Hold days.I finally bought some stocks, that is what happened.You need to learn to invest only what you are willing to lose. Do not trade daily, but set aside an amount you want to invest every month when you get your paycheck, invest that and you will win long-term. Don't check the status of your investments everyday. Live your life instead!My wife got her period a week early today. Portfolio sank 20%. I should have read the omens.This happens pretty much every week; and often on Thursday or Friday.Idk, I have a lot of GLD and BLV. I'm lookin okay MSFT and AAPL are my only positions more than 1% down.I love these posts from the newbies lol


10% increase in 30 days.


People take profit.


I did it myself and have opened shorts, if you pay attention you shouldnt be surprised or caught of guard by this.


Also earning reports will cause some volatility.I wish it was only 0.1%. Lost 4.77 percent. I’m no baller.A believable albeit insufficient reality check

Much news today
Fairy tale is coming to an endReality set inMaybe the country figured out that...it doesn’t make any sense for the stock market to be this optimistic right now?

Ha. Silly me. That’s not happening any time soon.Market decided that NOW 1000+ deaths a day from COVID-19 is a problem.It’ll be back don’t worryim bleeding from my Orpheuses, plural.Every where, there’s blood, every where!Same damn thing happened to me! I am a bit surprised, but my analysis and projections show it will not last so no problem. Just have to wait a bit. lolFor reall fucken teslaThey took the payroll tax cut out of the stimulus bill. Lower taxes mean high stock prices. Higher taxes mean lower stock prices or at least that was a catalyst for a pull back. On top of this most of the time SPY makes a new high they will pull the rug out from under buyers at least one time before the market can move higher. On top of that tech stocks are under review for antitrust investigation, but tech is overheated and needed a breather anyway. All this is a good excuse to scare out buyers, sucker in some short sellers, all for smart money to get long and then rip the market higher next week when the stimulus bill passes.Relax, it’s a short term correction. Many companies have been beating on earnings and we’ve had nothing but Green Day after Green Day for weeks. A short term correction was needed. Don’t panic sell...It's not even down 2% lmaooooLmao it didn't even go down that much? Do you expect stocks to constantly go up every single day?Honestly why is it as high as it is right now anyways?The fact you think a bomb has to go off somewhere for the market to be red shows you are soon to be parted from your money. Walk away while you're ahead, if you are.Please don’t go out for walks anymoreStonks are going on sale woooooWhat you bois thinking? Hold? I got shares in apple, amazon and google and the return is -3% rn* China / US tussle
* Unemployment numbers trended slightly higher for the first time in 4 months
* Economic stimulus package tussle between reps/cons
* Non-stellar tech earnings (note, several were good, but not 350 PE good)

In lieu of all the uncertainty -> Profit-takingMarket selloff. Seems pretty typical after a run like this. The Jim Cramer rule is that these selloffs last around 3 days. Basically, don't start buying until the end of the day Friday or early Monday.Omg Tesla went down to $1300 again, who would hVe thoughtGuess the SALE just started..The stimulus package is falling apart.  Republicans can’t even agree amongst themselves, much less with dems.Unemployment and coronavirus numbers.  It's alright, take it in stride. The market will digest the news and move on over the next few weeks.It’s a freaking stock Genocide! I see rivers of blood on my stocks appUnemployment is up and deaths for the rona rona are climbing.About timeThis might be the start of the second crashMarket was getting really hot the past couple weeks. I'm surprised it didn't roll over sooner.Unemployment went up and everyone is trippingSurprisingly I didn’t drop that much lol honestly I think we’re value stocks are going to be doing betterOf course I pick today to transfer money out of my account. Ugh, several things I could have bought at the moment!The great rotation has occurred...that is until the Fed intervenes and then its BTFDYeah everything is red for me. Not really fussed though as most of my stocks have been bought at all time lows and I'm playing the long game. Apart from Microsoft. I just bought in today and now it's down 2%. Ah well.What goes up goes down. Nothing going on hereJobless claim number is up. Also the inflated unemployment ends soon. 

This should pressure Congress.My portfolio is still hemorrhaginglol for some reason whenever the markets are deep in the red my portfolio is always green and whenever stonks are rallying im always deep in the redwell, I spread a healthy amount of margin on that toast.That the time of the month for stocks.It’s the second Great Depression. Sell everything ASAP.  *Sarcasm*I went longThinking about picking up a MSFT and/or AAPL stock. Any thoughts?time to start buying!

around 70% of my account is cash and I enjoy buying more than selling cos it means money down the road.

I think I actually prefer a red dayThat was a NASDAQ dye pack. They want their gains back.I just hope my Microsoft call goes up before the 31st so I don't lose any money because right it looks horribleWhat happened? Opportunity for me to buy stocks cheaper than what I could have yesterday. Loaded up on some more Apple stock after hours.Ain’t it fun.I feel like most Monday it goes up and most Thursday it goes down.Maybe the tensions between US and ChinaDIS just anounced movie delays, waiting for the next Disney anouncement about a park princess with a coughWhy did ABUS spike today?I readjusted my 401k portfolio from 90% bond/10% stocks to 90% stocks/10% bonds after patiently waiting for months exactly to see the value decrease.Elon will tweet something soon don’t worryI bet that you saw many more unemployed people out there walking too.Yes all of us were invited to gangbang partyJust finishing the reject on the unreasonable 2+% day gain NASDAQ saw on Monday. The question is whether more of the unreasonable gains over the last two months will also be rejected in the coming weeks. The rally would have flattened out at about 9000 if people weren't doing so god damn much coke.Yeah my $Net position hit stop loss tooWell everything is red except AMD and 10¢, but still even for the day cause crypto. ETH is 🚀While I'm sad that my current stocks lost a few grand, my optimist side is thinking "More stocks for my monthly DRIP investment!"  


Some days, you have to make your optimism :pBuy the dip 😂😂😂Okay not just meShit I thought my day was bad just barely breaking even..  then I saw the market watch, holy crap what a bloody dayi feeel sorry for the bullish people who owned contracts... RIP.Just glad i am not the only one. I had to not even look at my stonks this afternoon. Red blood bath over here.Tesla had good earnings.

Also the market is coming to the realization that the Senate is about to keep 216 billion a quarter out of its pockets.Volatility always goes wild on earnings weeks for big tech and financial. This week has actually been smoother than I expected.Buy buy buySheriff of Nottingham came along and scared away the RHersJpow our of printDouble top on a speculative bubble peak.A pullbackOh no we’re right back to where we were on Monday in SPX.. the world is gonna end browho knows nothing is real anymorejust the startThe proper response is that unemployment numbers for the us came out todayI barely saw stocks go down. Hello? Anyone here in March relate?I have AMD so my portfolio took off.My sell order that dumped my BOXL when I hit 10% gains triggered, which was nice. Still holding HMHC for big gains.

But my netflix dumped q.qFunny enough, my entire portfolio, except for two index mutual funds, Uber, and DropBox , was in the green.US released unemployment numbers today. Not promising. Stocks reacted to that.Shorted Intel and bought AMD, all green baby!!!I haven't bought anything lately; With Corona Madness, Elections, Mobs, I just don't think we should be at the heels of the pre-virus high. A bigger drop than today and some 'scary' virus news and I think the whole house of cards could fall again. Keeping my eye on a few things though (T, RCL, WMT).Unemployment numbers (reported) rocketed that’s what.My portfolio got reduced by 20% which is about 4.5k in one day. I don’t know what I was thinking by not selling MSFT and TSLA spreads in the morning while they were profitable. Also, EBAY calls went down all week. Thursdays are usually shitty day for the market (from what I noticed) and unemployment report completely sank the ship of stock market today 🚢When I asked this same question, the vast majority people of this thread gave me nothing but crap.  :(TSN is up...Sorry guys, bought calls on SPYThis is how the last big drop felt like...just a number of redder and redder days until plonk, ya fucked.Grow up2 billion in SPY sold yesterday in huge orders...Just seems like normal volatility to me based on the last few months.Sale dayVTSAX and Chill unless you’re 90 and then panic!!!!We’re up from March.  Stonks don’t always go up.I bought MSFT when it was down, then it went even further down.Ended the day down 3%. But I was up like 3% a day or 2 before so. I'm up 0%?Hmm, I'm up 1% today! All green baby!It's the Chinese again. Didn't think this espionage news was gonna affect stocks this much though. Good news for gold investors I guess.While not ideal it serves up a buying opportunity. Am I happy my portfolio dipped 1%? No, of course not. But gave me an opportunity to buy more MSFT, APPL and set limit orders in case they go down even more (which I’m anticipating). Also providing me entry to Boeing, Salesforce. Looking more into e-commerce beyond amazon as wellNo pain no gainThat’s what you get for walkingMy put options printed.Stonks that's whyIt’s called profit taking.Gold ETFs are booming though... Printer go brrrrrrrrrrrI'm pretty sure it has to do with the new jobs reporting and all the bad COVID newsAt first I thought there was a terrorist attack in  Silicon Valley- Pandemic

- US-China tensions

- US job losses not recovering

But again, these except for the last one where true a couple of days ago yet all went up, guess it is complicated.Same here, nothing my red all across the boardA beer bomb happened! $SAM LET'S GO!Crash. Nothing bigFrom what I read it dropped because of a giant spike in unemployment which is anticipating another market drop. Ironic huh?HAHA I sold Tesla at 1700 and stayed in cash lmao I knew this was coming and gold at 2000 proved it, now I shorted Tesla to see it go down back to 1000 range or loweryes, the coronavirus bomb has gone off in the U.S.20/20 Hindsight for future reference:  
We were supposed to sell last week at peak green/FOMO.  
Then, we should have been flush with cash to wait for rock bottom/FUD to buy back in now.  


Oops, better luck next time!Maybe because COVID funding coming to an end next week?I’m up. KNOS making me good moneyWhat is the app?AAL went on sale, loaded up, next week it’ll go up enough to make a nice profit. Hope everyone got what they wanted while it was on sale. 👍My portfolio dropped 600 today. Could’ve been worse, I’ll take it.If you look at a 3 month SPY chart you'd see that there's resistance around 327. Today it looks like we bounced off that resistance, and if I had to guess, I'd say we're on our way back down to 300 before it breaks the 327. Couple this with mixed news about unemployment and many companies missing their earnings estimates, you get red.The fuse was lit at the end of the 2016 presidential election.China.So.... you bought tech after their huge price jumps and are surprised they dropped?Senate republicans are dragging their ass and fighting on a proposal. The market doesn’t like uncertainty. This is why it dropped this afternoon.[deleted]The tipping point into the second bear market dipPresident is now “taking COVID” seriously publicly.That’s normal. You will see some more red days in the coming months. Just make sure to buy good stocks and you will sleep better. Watch this! [Large cap stocks](https://youtu.be/b50k46U5tDA) and this!

I’m unfortunately never wrong when I say that.That’s already priced inBut Dave Portnoy told everyone stocks only go up!!!!!Can't explain that.Stocks go up, stocks go down, but stonks only go upThey can go *down*??? What the hell dude? No one told me that!!!You just can’t explain thatNever a miscommunication.but stonks only go up.No stocks only go up!!Bill O'Reilly gives stock adviseBetter hope it goes Down down. Sale is lifeStonks only go up thoughI'm a complete amateur but sometimes the posts here seem so pointless and alarmist to even me. It's like they've never had stocks before? 

People trying to give explanations and narrative's to every little change. 

Wonder what the general usefulness is of coming here as a newbie and what the experience of the 750,000 odd subscribers is like.I mean the S&P will always go up over time, it will have it's dips but should increase considerably every 10 years.I was told stocks only go upBlasphemy! Stonks only go up.Same tbh, bought Tesla at high, fml.Yep exact same situation hahaI bought a 100 dollar spy call... i broke the marketGenerally I agree, but with everything going on this year, if the markets were to drop 5% tomorrow I think there would be a lot of panic of ‘the bubble popping’ and could potentially cause an undesirable domino effectMy portfolio looked like the Manhattan ProjectThis. They are just numbers on a screen and usually don't mean that much, but the bright colours fool us into thinking that something bigger is going on. Some days market goes down a percent or two, but our banks show the same red page as if it was -40%.Yeah but I don’t want it to go down right after I dump $6k into my account 😔S&P down 1.23%. DJIA down 1.31%. NASDAQ down 2.29%. 

And OP asks if a bomb went off. 

If you freak out over these kind of dips the stock market is not for you.Oh my god my 7/31 Nikla put just went green overall. It’s been red down to -50% for like three weeks straight...but....my...money..... ..
my...stonks.....  ThEY hAVe nO RIghT!??!?!?!Doubt itA pandemic? 

 Huh.  

Must not have reached the US yet.Wait what is the pandemic thing you are speaking of?Nothing I want is for sale:(I swear y’all buy a stock that’s on “sale” cuz it’s 5% down in a day even though it just shot up 420% the day before thinking it’s a deal 🙄It's down to where it was 3 days ago.still wait for 30% crashWow down four percent. It’s a fucking fire sale!A million deaths is a statistic. People are becoming numb until an infrastructure collapseOne death is a tragedy, a million deaths a statistic.haven't sold anything since bought in march and a little here and there on some dips, we still in the greenIs that a trump tweet?How so?Bruh same 😢😢So you are in acceptance stage now? That was fast.Same, I was holding out and before close yesterday I picked up some options. Everything I touch is red now 😂You corny“Sentient Cheetoh” I fucking love it, gonna start using this oneOofYay the retardSo military industry complex about to be banking then, huh?LMAO nice :DThere's something poetic about my two airline stocks being my only two greens lol.Same.  Very red day.  Better be a goddamn good stimulus package in the pipeline to pump things back up.This is the way..Of my 35 stocks, Cheesecake Factory, Comcast, Danaher, Forrester Research, Hershey, Lemonade, Purple Innovation, Redfin, and Rosetta Stone all went up.Please... unemployment happened 4 months ago. markets been going up and down everyday. Day1: "market shrugs off covid cases for rally" day2: "market recedes on increasing cases" day3: "market climbs dispite unemployment" day4: "unemployment numbers drive selloff"... i could write the market speculations with my eyes closed for the next month.It got extended?Dont think of it as losing a brother, think of it as gaining a delicious corpse.Always.  I see red and think, I’m going shopping.  😎🤩🔥While I find your description very ho-hum, it's still entertaining to read. Thanks for the laugh sir.Blue team isn’t “adding things in”, red team never wanted to provide more support and are trying to figure out how they could potentially profit from a second round before releasing it. The PPP loans were a scam for red team to reward their friends and ignore small businesses in need.Love the Team America referenceWhat's wrong with averaging down?I average down by rebalancing. But a whole lot of people here are 100% equity which means there isn't much rebalancing that can be done.I set a stop-loss on $TSLA and took my profits. It was a fun ride!Why Apple thoughDecided to get into stocks too recently. It was holidays and I was bored. I would undo everything if I could.At least she got hers..At least you have a wife.  Half the people on here only have a hand full of Amzn/tesla/MSFT shares to comfort themselves when the winter comes.Your pull out game is clearly strong, but not where it mattersThen we can have record breaking Mondays. I swear Mondays have been hella green lately.My guess is day/swing traders closing out the long positions they don't want to hold over the weekend idkGLD makes perfect sense.  Money printers all over the world making 2008 look like an old dot matrix printer.  It will keep going up.  
  
What was your reasoning with BLV?If you know this is coming why didn't you short amazon/tesla/Microsoft/appl?

I wouldn't consider myself a newbie and was completely off guard.  I did take the opportunity and bought a bunch of shares.  Probably more than most people's net worth.As well as eurydice?The Tech was called "safe heaven". Now it is clear - the only safe heaven is cash. Why would anybody invest in 'safe heaven' that drops 5 per cent a day? it's no heaven. it's shitAmd down 3.59% :/Haha. I was just thinking the same thing. There was a pullback just a week ago - wilth Nasdaq crashing down and then it made a rebound and crashed again.Wait, people were telling here that MSFT is immune to unemployment. I am confused.I do. i do not buy into tech bubble. pretty much everyone else on this sub though  is loaded on techRight. Even some sht in my portfolio that was sitting there red for weeks like CAKE and Delta was green. People on this sub have very narrow watchlists containing mostly of Nvidia, MSFT and Tesla.No. Not all stocks reacted to that. Only overvalued "safe tech". I was looking to buy some other stocks like visa, pepsy or some farma stocks - and none dip, but actually , they grew. Get out of tech bubble.when I said the buble will burst on earnings day - they downvoted me and called me an idiot.Ballsy move.   

I am holding on.  The thing about TSLA is that if you have the stomach to take a 10%-15% down for weeks, you'll be rewarded with a 100% return at the end.

At least that's what I am telling myself to be able to sleep better at night. :)Is that 1% or 0.1%?A correction is at least 10% not 1.33% lolBeing 12 years old is hardIf there was a red darker than blood, that would be itProbably already boughtMaybe he should wait and buy the crater laterIts a ROTH IRA, a dip doesn't matter at all.He’s probably crying right nowHe might have said that, but he really meant that STONKS only go up.He’s a hackYou mean stonks?Damn magnetsStanks only go downA common misconception; stocks frequently fluctuate, whereas stonks only go to the moonThis is WSB way..How high?  i bought it at 1765 :(, it will take days  to get my money back.I maintain that tesla is single-handedly responsible for this drop. Its so retardedly overvalued with its stupid meme status of people just wanting a piece of Elons galaxy brain as opposed to any concept of the value of the underlying asset, that every other 'tech' stock is being treated as guilty of equal overvaluation by association.That's on youRip me, do you think it will rebound tomorrow?Yeah same bought at $1650 prior to opening after a positive earningThere was more than a 5% drop near the beginning of June... What happened? People just bought the dip, and the losses are more than fully recovered.I've got a lot of cash on hand to buy the sale so I hope you're right! 

But I also doubt it. People said this about that 5% drop a few weeks ago. And now we're at or close to ATH in every index.

1-3% dip is nothing.Then you shouldn't be investing in the stock market to begin with.

No one knows what's going to happen tomorrow. If you can't stomach even tiny dips like 1-3% open a savings account or a CD.In the big scheme of things $6k is a drop in the bucket.Dollar cost averaging is your friend, especially in this market. Attempt to spend $500-1000 a week versus all at once. You'll make smarter decisions near the end versus the begining, and in all likelihood, you're more like to save money this way than to miss out on big gains.You could take the approach to always have a percentage of cash on the side to invest in case of a huge dip. Keep it as an insurance policy. It helps when you're feeling concerned about your entry point. That way if the market goes down you can be happy to be able to take advantage of a better price. Once you accumulate more cash, then you can invest your insurance policy, perhaps diversify into something else.  

 And always think long term concerning what you already have invested.lolIf I may ask why was it such the red day, was it pretty much the unemployment numbers and spiking cases or was there more news I missed?I like how people downvote because they’re butt hurtIt JUST went green? I'm pretty new to options so maybe I'm a dumbass, but Nikola has fallen like a stone the last few weeks. Can you post your positions?I'm awaiting my stimulus.  we've had one yes, but what about second stimulus?

Wont somebody care about the stockholders of this country?And if it does, we can just nuke it.Apple 5% downThe one stock I've been trying to accumulate this month (Accenture) still refuses to dip, and I'm wary of buying at an all-time high in this environment.Prepare to wait for a long time. You must have missed the beginning of the year and 2018No crash with so much money pouring inAren't we all. I've been holding my nutsack since March 23rd.NoIf you're trying to buy low, mortgage related stocks like MFA and IVR are near their March lows right now.This is basically the last time to buy right now. In September the first working vaccines will come out and Trump will not allow for a market crash to happen before the election. If he loses it's great news too, because Biden will not touch his billionaire buddies and announce large infrastructure rebuilding projects and get on his knees for China.One percent... "great day to buy the dip bois! 1% drop when the S&P 500 is near all time highs during a massive pandemic that's only getting worse! Bargains everywhereeee!"Diamond hand.

I tried but never was able to hold on for too long.  Buying and selling are addicting.They closed lower than they opened. The SEC needs to address this immediately before investors completely lose trust in the market. Absolutely bs.I’m a big fan of ‘Mango Mussolini’ personallyYes so original...Well Lockheed Martin just sold 45 F-35 ll and 65 F-35B  configuration to japan on an expedited sell order from the DOD after our little covid outbreak incident outbreak on one of our marine bases there, so in short it’s popping off also China is imposing “sanctions” on Lockheed Martin over the sale of the F-35’s and the sail of repurposed patriot Systems to Taiwan. The “sanctions” only seemed to add green to Lockheed’s stock after the news broke. Watch out for BAE systems too they have a promising future with Northrop and Lockheed maybe even a triple merger into a separate devoted company just for the Airforce, Navy and DOD.Check out Rhinemetall too Rhinemetall is popping off after their billion dollar arms contract with Saudi Arabia and shhhh Israel but no one can prove Israel funded some of the deal, but it’s the general consensus in the intelligence community that they did.Spirit lets go... 😂Why are you invested in Cheesecake Factory 😭Aren't the Republicans tryign to end the benefits though?  Seems $2400/month less for unemployed might impact market.Yes, but its worse than they expected.Mitch laughsHo-hum?Ya see kids here’s what happens when you play red team blue team... 

Everyone argues and nothing gets done...
We ain’t playing red team and blue team hoire.This x 1000.You get fucked if the stock doesn’t go back upI believe XD sadly I wasnt in at rocket launch so no way I was joining that ridiculous rideOver 20% in 3-4 months is not a healthy market for such a huge company. Its not sustainable at all in the long runMust be nice to have tsla sharesThe long term bond index funds have been performing better when the market goes down than their treasury counterparts. That’s basically the extent of it. Bonds do well during downturns and treasuries make me nervous right now.> Probably more than most people's net worth.

The median net worth is about $11,00 (at least in US) so not sure that's as big a *$#k measure as you'd hoped.

> I did take the opportunity and bought a bunch of shares. 

After close? This isn't snarky, this is an honest question, how does one go about doing that? I doubt I ever would want to, but just curious if average joe's and joanna's are able to do so.Cus i did? Or the SPX atleast. Long from 3k. Also long on eurusd and silver, exited 50-70% positions earlier today. Entered some short.


Touching tesla is bad cus IVIdk, tech could all be overvalued cuz of the rally who knowsHOld some bond etfs. Perfect for rebalancing and reinvesting in equity during a crashAfter hours up 8.02% ;) thoMust be nice to be loaded on techpharma dipped too-- look  at Moderna and Arcturus for example...OxbloodIt made mine green, because I've been betting on this shit to kick off.Bought some but not all; won’t matter much at all in the grand scheme of thingsNo, he said when they go down, they print more Schrute bucks and *then* they go back up, he’ll be buying the dip like the rest of usHe’s buyingProbably not he’s only worth like 200 millions dollars and is his own boss what a terrible lifesports started again, he sold all positions.Dave Ramsay doesn’t own stocks, he sells $29.99 e-books to new investors - convincing them to buy more products and attend his seminars so they can learn how to eliminate their debt by paying cash for “knowledge”.He is an entertainer, people wish he was a guru.factsLove the guy, but why is he on CNBC - cmon, hes gambling with a big pocket book. Not someone to take advice from.Word.Might be more than just days.whats wrong with you guys buying TSLA at THIS price? Literally anyone, even people holding the stock, knows its valuation is just insane. I too am upset I did not buy TSLA when it was under $400. Fomoing in at this price is just stupid though. You realize if the market drops again, its the stocks that have run up the most that people take profits from the fastest, right?

Lots of people I know that have been holding TSLA for awhile are selling most of their positions to lock in gains and invest in stocks that have room to grow. They will buy it back cheaper when it nearly almost positively will be

You will be very lucky if you think you'll get your money back in days. It dropped after a profitable earnings and news that it will be included in the S and P 500....Yep, I'm down 550 for the day :/Bought it at 1600.aw man. I was upset that I got it at 1593 and then the price dipped right after buying itTesla is the next Cisco. Who knows how high the stock will go? But then when it hits that high, 10 years later it still won't have reached a new high.

It's the fate of all cult stocks that get pumped to insane valuations. If the company is successful it takes 10 years for the profits to catch up to the share price. Happened to all of the Tesla's from 20 years ago like Cisco, Microsoft, Intel ... they were Tesla back in the day.

But Tesla can still go a lot higher short term because it's a cult stock. But ti's not a buy and hold for 20 years because the valuation is getting too insane. Will take 10 years for the profits to justify the valuation. But I hope you make a million before the stock price tops out.You're not getting it back bro lolSorry i screwed you over,  bought tesla at 1550. Now it's downhill from here.Yes, I think so. Due to multiple reasons, the new factory, battery, potential spy500. Let's hope so. What do you think?Oh i didnt buy TSLA but the whole amrket was red so...y'all are insane buying TSLA at this price... Why don't you buy stocks that do not move 100's of dollars in either direction each day and actually have lots of room to grow? Not one that has gone from under $400 in March to nearly a 2k highYea but this is the stock market. Every reaction is an over reaction man. All I can say, do a lot of DD and leave your emotions out of it.Shhh, facts aren't allowed on this fearmongering forumExactly!

Know what you're buying, (even if you're scalping.)

Good companies come back and their stocks eventually do go up.I agree, but to be fair it didn’t seem like they were panicking or anything. Just disappointed to see it’s gone down right after they bought everything and missed out on a potential “discount”.Well in either case, nobody wants the market to drop right after buying in.Hasn’t lump sum investing shown better results historically than DCA?might be cuz of all the earnings that was released this week or people had some sense and noticed we r still in a pandemic**tl;dr** stocks go in, stocks go out. you can't explain that.

New cases per day are actually down, NYT reported the current 14-day trend as +27%; it was in the +60% every day just last week. However, deaths are up (which was expected, there's always a delay compared to new cases).

I don't think it was the unemployment numbers, which I remain somewhat skeptical about when it comes to what they really mean. For example I am working reduced hours at my job but also collecting unemployment that makes up for that, including the $600 from the CARES Act. It's an agreement that was made between my employer and my state government.

So, I am making basically my pre-COVID salary+$600/week at a very stable job, but am counted as someone who has filed for unemployment.

I know this is probably an uncommon (and incredibly lucky) situation, but how uncommon is it? How many people are technically filing for unemployment but are still working or have agreements with their employer to go back to work? Or are being supported by the government? It's anecdotal but I know a lot of people who lost jobs due to COVID in March/April and have already found new (and often better) jobs that are adapting to our new reality.

Long story short, unemployment seems like a catastrophe right now, but I'm not convinced. This isn't the Great Depression Part 2. Are things bad? Yes. Is it going to get worse during Autumn/Winter? Almost definitely if we don't have a vaccine. But society is not on the verge of collapse. 

Anyway, if I had to guess about the dip today it's probably just people trying to lock in gains because they're short-term investors and think we're at or near the top of what they perceive to be a bubble. Especially tech stocks. This is why I'm mostly in VOO/VTI + BLV (decent returns so far despite the hate around bonds) + cash to take advantage of any large dips in the future (today was not that day).

But I also have no idea what I'm talking about so please do not make any financial decisions based on anything I've just written.The real question is why haven’t there been more red days like this not your question.  

If you are confused then you aren’t paying attentionI'm looking forward to their new model car, the Nikola Jpeg!Isn't this the sub that hates options and think everyone should only hold stocks for 30 years though?Both 7/31, one was $40 and one was $35. I like a common retard bought while they were falling last time, so price was higher than if I’d bought while they were at 60 or something.

The thing with options is that the time value is a part of the cost to purchase. So if you buy four weeks out like I did, and then JPMorgan reiterates their $45 price target and Nikla immediately spikes back to $55, you’re stuck holding them in the red. When the price drops again 3 weeks later, you’ve also lost 3 weeks of time value as well. 

Example, I purchased these for $6 and $6.80. With Nikla now at 34.21, the same options are worth $3.07 and $6.68. The 40 is currently green because it’s far enough under 40 to make the intrinsic value higher than the lost time value over that period.

Hopefully that helps? Dunno if I wrote clearly or just confused you more tbhMost American thing I've read this morningNot nearly enoughSo it's back to where it was last Wednesday. Not exactly a saleNot for me. I prefer a higher margin of safety. I’m trying to exercise my patience muscle and not rush.\> Apple 5% down

also

microsoft down 4.3% 

after better than expcted earning report

intel  down 7% 

neat estimates and 20% revenue growth but after market because of news about 6 month delay in next chip

&#x200B;

i'm loading up on XLK first thing in the morning. (the etf's top holding are microsoft, apple, visa, intel, and mastercard make up 50% of the etf's holdings)

&#x200B;

xlk was down 2.6% yesterday

it's more than i wanted  to dip into my cash savings but i'm not gonna pass this up.I got in when it was down 2%! Shoulda waited a little longer but anyways it was a calculated “hold until profitable” move. Should do just fine unless China collapses over night. i was buying at every crashdebt sale ratio is 10-20x thanks but no thanksOh you know vaccines usually take years in the making and not months. And there was no report of any big success leading to a vaccine. This is going to get really funny when winter comes around. But let’s stay optimistic.There is a reason that Gold and Silver are going up so fast today.  The big players are getting out of U.S. stocks because the U.S. dollar may collapse much sooner than expected.  We could be at a breaking point.  Wouldn't surprise me if China called in some of that precious U.S. debt in order to push things further along.I guess I don’t know much about the stock market but I thought that prices can shift overnight due to after-hours trading.Im partial to Fanta Fascist and Agolf Twittler. I have also heard Hair FurorCheetoh Benito is my faveI wanted a high risk restaurant stock as a growth bet. Now I'm bagholding it......

Ironically, all the other stocks I listed above have been huge for me this past month, which is not normal. This is usually my bad collection haha.

Hershey's been going through the roof, Purple, Redfin and Rosetta are on fire, Danaher's at ATH, Lemonade's up 20% since I bought in, and I bought Forrester last August when it had like a 30-40% drop in one day and it's FINALLY not declining. And Comcast has finally broken through into the low-40s.

Fingers crossed for CAKE.The Senate and White House are currently negotiating with the House for a continuation of benefits.

No one wants to be blamed for a repeat of the Great Recession, especially not Mitch McConnell who is facing his first serious challenge in years this November.

There will be another aid package, I guarantee it.Might is an kind of an understatement. This will end ending cashflow for 10-12% of the 'working' population, most of whom are out of work by no fault of their own. The GOP-supported plan initially called for a $500/wk cut to benefits; whether or not they actually support that cut is a matter of controversy, apparently the GOP has been infighting over this for the past 2 months since the house passed it's version of the bill... because it's going to directly affect nearly 20 million people. 

On top of that, they aren't sending their plan through until next week. UI Benefits end today. Had this been a bipartison stimulus/relief bill I would be less critical, but Senate democrats have had no input into it. What the fuck is Mitch McConnell doing?Repubs are trying to suspend payroll tax for the rest of the year - which is better for the market than a stim pt. 2; worse for unemployed people.Cant wait... when the cares act ends the loan payment suspensions end so banks and reits bounce in 2 quartersNobody is trying to end the benefit. The benefit ends on its own this/next week depending on state. Now it’s up to the dems and republicans to agree on how to extend it.You live in a dream world.Everyone thinks this is a financial crisis like 08, not realizing the manual shutdown. Idk if your republican democrat libertarian vegetarian. I dont follow red blue purple, just green and if you can sit a top the fence and look down its pretty cut and dry. The economy will come back ask the 20 yr history of china after the first sars outbreak (before they went on an economic tear unseen beofore)There’s nothing to discuss, it’s all true. You’re either not paying attention or listening and reading shit that lies to you.For meme stocks sure, but for companies that's aren't going to just vanish in the near future it's relatively low risk, if you're planning to hold for long.I mean, if you're smart to not invest in the stupid meme stocks that David Portnoy and his ilk recommend, you shouldn't have to worry about that.Up 75% from its March lowsI bought the shares between 2 pm-3 pm so it's well within opening hours.  Many brokers let people buy and sell stocks between 7 am to 7 pm. 

11k is still a respectable amount to buy in a single day.  I bought quite a bit more than that.There are many other relatively safe companies to invest into and get dividends much higher than bonds. A little more risky than bonds, but less risky than Tech stock.Good to hear. It’s been sideways since I bought it around 51.That's bio pharma and highly volatile assets - all priced around covid vaccine progress. I am talking about real pharma stocks: JNJ, PFE, MRK, ABBV.🌈 🐻First day of a public sector Econ class I was in years ago. Pretty old and wiry Professor comes in and without saying anything to us the first thing that come out of his mouth is this: If you learn or remember nothing else from this class, just make sure that it’s to open a Roth IRA... Opened a Roth with my first employer out of college lolNo he said when the Schrute bucks go DOWN, Stanley Nickels go UP. I’m pretty sure.Even rich boys cry sometimesWalking with the prince of peace!Its not like he even does analysis and shit, he just buys what people tell him to buy mostly lmaoYou can literally tell when he’s in character or not & it’s crazy most people haven’t figured it out yetMight be neverI might have to buy more at cheaper price to bring the average down.I am still new into this. Learning with every trade.Relaxyou realize tesla drops for 1-2 days every earnings then jumpsI bought may last year, and sold for 1500 last week. I completely agree with you!I bought $5 worth the other day just so I can come along for the rideI'm upset I didn't pull the trigger when it was around 290 last year.. I could have transfered enough funds to buy at least 4 shares, but didn't want to risk it. Oh well, I ended up needing that money elsewhere. Still upset about it though.Cause we're going to the Moon, baby! Actually probably also going to Mars! 🚀🛸🌝☄️🪐TSLA will hit $2000 before the end of the year! 💵💰💵💰💰💵I am out at break even or a total write off for me. It can stay in my portfolio to look pretty.Who cares, already made more than that in penny stock pre market today.If the market is red that's exactly when you buy. 

Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.That’s exactly why. Because they don’t move $100s a day80% of this sub are not investing, they are trading. Traders don't have the same safety in their stocksEvery reaction is not an overreaction. That's a mindless cliche. This isn't just random arbitrary bullshit contrary to what 2020 might look like. 

Believing every action in the market isn't real, or overreacting, is like believing stonks only go up. You might as well just invest in an index fund if that's as deep as your thoughts goWell.  Not really.  
  
Look up the Output Gap.  The entire world is set to lose something like $9T in GDP this year.  That money just straight goes up in smoke.  The markets may not recover back to their previous levels for 5-10 years.  It's unknowable, but it is entirely possible that the next 5-10 years will show a net loss for your portfolio.  In which case you'd be better off pulling out now and reinvesting later.Exactly is right.

I'm not even some big player in the market, I make around 30k/year and through patience and smart investing I've made a ton of money just by buying small dips.

I will never understand why people sell when the market is down. Why would you sell something when the price is low? Ridiculous.I'm sure it has in certain cases, especially more experienced investors, but "An Intelligent Investor" states that in most environments, putting a monthly (or even weekly) sum into a stock will lead to less overall loss.But we’re in a unique case, right now where the market has these amazing days and horrible ones and ok, but it hasn’t been fixated on a clear down trend because of the pandemic overall, everything has been trying to rebound or has started to.Yeah the whole unemployment situations has been weird, personally I’m going to start filing as I’m about to quit my job and chill for a few weeks before I move to college, however if you quit you can’t technically receive unemployment but I used to be a teachers pet to my manager and I’ll think she’ll allow it if I ask her to “lay me off”. 

A lot of the FAANGs bled today, and many people were taking profits off of earnings this week> New cases per day are actually down, NYT reported the current 14-day trend as +27%; it was in the +60% every day just last week. 

This is actually still an increase since the trend is referring to the rolling average of "new cases per day." But it is an apparent deceleration of the _rate_ of increase, which is something. i.e. the car is still accelerating, but you're not flooring it anymore.Lol that guy is a snake-oil salesmanPretty much. This sub is basically r/investing. Day trading, options, and penny stocks are not really encouraged here.I SOLD $110 January $110 puts collecting $7800 in premium for each contract sold ($78.00) and today I bought those puts back for a few grand PROFIT. But, I sold them when I.V. was at like 450%. Now that the drop happened, I.V. is much less, making premiums (option prices) much less expensive

So, even though though I sold the puts when NKLA was close to $70, they were worth LESS when the stock is under $40 :)

Options are very complex. You need to know about theta and I.V. otherwise you do not know shit (not saying you, just saying in general)I want to give you gold but I'm gonna use that money to buy some $HTZWell we aren’t as intelligent as you sorryNew to all of this and trying to learn, can I ask for your reasoning in this? I see that XLK dropped as well but don’t quite understand the buying into it when it’s only dropped ever so slightly.China collapse would be worth it imhoOK, good for you. quick question depending on how big a crash you define as a market crash(and a 30% dive is up there) market crashes happen about every decade. what the hell do you do with your money the rest of the time and does it bug you that you miss out on some pretty massive growth in between(which is quite often higher than the entire decline before including dividends and compounding).Imagine being this uninformed and proud of it. Oxford will have their vaccine ready soon.He’s just fuckin with youThese are new and I love them lolAgolf Twittler made me short milk out of my nose. I don't even drink milk!Thats a 90's one hit wonder I'm convinced.Have to say I agree. Gotta love the narratives being pumped by the press though.You think banks will bounce with all the mortgage defaults coming?Allowing it to expire is essentially the same as ending it. Some Republicans favor that, though some want to replace it with smaller aid.Oh, I thought the Democrats in the house already passed a bill to extend it and it was in Republicans court (Senate) now.Please elaborate.That plus the 6 TRILLION that went to special debt purchase vehicles setup by the fed in March to keep multinational corporations afloat during the crisis by buying up all of their worthless debt that would have and never will pay out.  

Our government just blew out the next few generations wealth to prevent private shareholders from taking the same hit the US taxpayers are taking.  Not only that, they are using the US taxpayers funds to do it.aka STOCKS ONLY GO UP

&#x200B;

\^\^\^until they don'tYou don’t know what companies are going to vanish though, look at Enron.ExactlyAh yes, I'm thinking 2:00 my time which is market close. Appreciate the response, and again, don't think it's best to be wagging around, but you do youI mean bond etfs doesnt really drop too much during a recession (either drops few days later, doesn't drop at all or only drop few percentages) so you can quickly sell them cuz they r very liquid, rebalance it during a crash by buying a stock etf and when the stock etf soars, rebalance it again by selling the stock or etf and placing it into a bond etf. Even if its a safe company, it would usually drop during a crash.

Dividends are just a nice add on  :)Haha a good story, apparently it’s been driven home enough to me because I’m only a junior in college and I’m using paychecks from my internship to contribute. I did one of those online calculators, learned the time value of money and power of compound interest and that was enough to run, not walk, to Vanguard.I‘m from Europe. What‘s Roth IRA?Man, I wish I could have a roth IRA, but apparently my country sees no point in having such a thingKid is still in college... will do that with his first years' earnings as student lab assistant. 

They invented the 401k after I had been working a few years, with lots of strings ( open to you after a year's service, options to change annually...) I got a late start, and was grossly underpaid for a few years, too. Lesson: start early. Start your kid early. Lend them money to do it. Time makes these easy wealth builders.Is it like Alex Jones's character ?Was that personal trainer that fucked his girl in character too?probably tomorrow thouoghYou’re gonna destroy the stock market. Had Warren Buffet reached out to you for stock tips yet?Two reasons TSLA cld make another large move in the short term: 1) number of Shorts with bets against TSLA  2) rumors of potential for SPY listing.         those two reasons alone will keep this trading in a tight range.   Unlikely to bleed that deep red  imoEveryone buying TSLA is new to this, which, is why you should not buy it

and you should not be trading. You should be investingI am? I am warning all these new kids to be carefulHappy Cake Day!Keep doing that and I guarantee you'll lose all your moneyAgree. There's no point to buy when everyone buys it.Yeah, its great when it moves $200 up for the day, what about down?

If another sell off happens, which, many predict it will, the first stocks people are going to take profits from are stocks that are up 100s of %. You know, like TSLA? Why do you think tech is bleeding right now but "value" stocks like airlines are up? People are taking profits from stocks that are at all time highs and putting them in things that are still over 50% from their previous highs...

buying any stock that moves up over 10% (up or down) daily, on no news, is pure gambling.So you’re telling me when a stock goes down it doesn’t go ever go up? Or when a stock goes up it doesn’t ever go down? Check minute, daily, and weekly graphs and you’ll understand more.If you think you are timing "dips" you're just... fooling yourself.  
  
Nobody can time dips.  You don't know if its at the bottom yet, and you don't know it will ever beat where its at.cuz it's all priced in...I obviously don't know your situation but it's funny you mention quitting your job and moving to college. My employer is actually in this sector so I have a lot of information about how universities and colleges are handling this situation, and the answer is "not very well."

If I were you, I would be very very careful and prudent about what your next moves are when it comes to college, especially if that means quitting a job in the middle of what could turn out to be one of the worst economic crises in American history (probably unlikely, like I said in my original post, but still possible!). The college I work with has not yet made a decision about opening up and won't until late-August but I would not be surprised at all if they do not for the Fall Semester, which would be a financial disaster for them. 

And it would also make for a very pointless semester for students. College is a LOT more than just taking classes and you should not be paying tens of thousands of dollars to listen to some professor lecture on Zoom. You can already get that for free.

Anyway, good luck to you with whatever you do my friend! I hope everything works out well for you. Just make sure you consider the future before you make any big choices./r/investing oscillates wildly between 3 fund indexing for life and full WSB depending on the day/thread/market conditions

This is more just the active investing subTotally agreed, great follow-up :D not understanding those two will totally fuck you if you don’t see them coming and think options function like stocks doSold on margin?Instead buy some Hyliion before the mergerHuh?sure xlf is a technology exchanghe traded fund... they diversify into the tech industry and are a good alternative is you don't have the cash to buy full shares of microsoft and apple  ..i dont lol... 

XLK's top 4 holding's are

Microsoft Corp	MSFT	22.01%
Apple Inc	AAPL	19.43%
Visa Inc Class A	V	5.05%
Intel Corp	INTC	4.31%

apple is down 5% on good news
micosoft is down 4.3% on good news
intel is down 7% on good news (earnings wise. the 6 month chip delay is nothing major)

if all 3 bounce back that's a huge profit.

those four make up just over 50% of XLK fund's holdings.

 so buying xlk you are buying a fund where apple, microsoft and intel are the 3 companies that  make up about half of what the fun is invested in...


essentially buying xlk is buying a little apple, a little microsoft, and a little intel... which are all down between 4% and 7% despite good news and being the safest bets for growth of any stocks right now

xlk being down 2.6% .... with half of it's money invested in microsoft, apple, and intel....  it's a safe bet that that all 3 are going to bounce back tomorrow and continue to grow for a long time.

xlk is up 25% in the last year...35% in the last 3 months. this little 2.6% dip is the best little drop with a near 100% guarentee to go up (way up) that you're going to ever see 


arkk is another etf to look at because it's owns more tesla than another etf.. and is also invested in other solid companies so you can ride the tesla wave and not get burned when the tesla bubble pops

arkk is up 70% on the year

i loaded up on arkk today when tesla dipped

and i'm gonna load up an equal amount on xlk tomorrow because microsoft apple and intel are all dipping. 

a comparison of xlk and arkk ... both funds very smart buys. smart safe and big returns. (you buy the fund like a stock, xlk is the symbol for the fund diversified into 50 different companies... 50% of it is microsoft, apple and inte... 47 other tech companies make up the other 50%)

here's a comparison of the two funds:
https://www.askfinny.com/compare/xlk-vs-arkk

im going to buy just as much xlk as i spent on arkk today (which is still a good time to buy,,, i recommend doing the same but thats just my opinion)

does that make sense? im not great at explaining.. or i over explain sometimes lollol wutyou know nothing about risk management? are you either all stock or all cash?This is exactly how the current administration thinks. It’s just not the truth. I really at best think we will have a vaccine ready to go by January. This is not some small thing. A vaccine can’t be just be rushed in 4 months. Obviously we wish it could but it’s just not possible.You seem to live in a different reality..., Oxford said that after tests the vaccine is helping the immune system just like every other vaccine tested right now. BioNtech made a successful supporting vaccine but this is no where near an actual vaccine for Covid-19. WHO is expecting the first vaccine in 2021, making you immune against Covid. Imagine being this uninformed and proud of it. 

More than 20 different vaccines are getting tested btw. And yes Oxford is pretty far but thats nothing in that kind of market.Lol this guyI am going to go insane with you people.

**A vaccine sitting on a desk approved for release won’t magically be available to you the same day or month or maybe even year**. Needles need to be produced, vaccine kits produced, shipped all over, scheduling and prioritizing high risk people first, cost and payment problems. It won’t be free in America so can we even get to herd immunity? Booster shots may be needed since no long term study will be done on each vaccine formulation.

We are going to need **billions** of these. You can’t make those over night.

Now backing up, drug trials can take 5-10 years on average. Rushing anything *will* have negative consequences. Trials are done for good reason. Do you want more antivaxxers and problems because putting out an unsafe or ineffective vaccine will do that.History repeats itself. 2009 record defaults. 2010 record new small businesses.Plus an estimate up to 70% of suspended mortgage owners havent completely lost income/are unable to pay. Ppl are (wisely) taking advantage of the inttest free delay. Im actually kinda surprised in the market demand but then again the earnings speak for themselves.Some companies are not going anywhere.   Johnson and Johnson, Walmart, McDonalds, coke.  Not terribly exciting stocks I know.Right. I understand. I just offered another alternative to cash and bond etfs that I did not think about. Especially if we are talking about investing money for a period of time to ride you through the recession. I am talking of some big companies like non-overvalued DJIA components: 3M, MRK, JNJ and whatever else is not trending above pre-march highs and overvalued and offer some 3-5 dividends.I think it’s pretty much a forgone conclusion that by the time you or I retire Americans will be paying considerably more in all forms of tax. Taking advantage right now is one of the smartest things you can do. It really amazes me the amount of people who don’t even have a fundamental understanding of compound interest. It’ll make you rich in old age if you’re smart when you’re young.Dude, awesome.  A guy today told me his secret to millions was compound interest.  It’s so boring but it’s true.  I entered late to the game (40s) and I’m kicking myself for not starting at your age.  If you just toss a little here and there at your age, and keep doing it, you will be doing so well in 20 years!I've had vanguard for years through my work, so the pay any fees 😄 I'm up to 19% on my contributions.Good for you.   I do all my investing/trading with Roth IRAs.  That way I can trade daily and never worry about taxes.  Plus I can ignore my losses when the market dips since I have plenty of time to wait until things go back up.  I even set up one for my daughter who is 15.  She doesn't have any earned income so I put it in my name, with her as the beneficiary.  She can use it to invest in whatever she likes (my goal is to get her interested in investing) and when I die she will be able to transfer it into her name.+1A retirement investment account. In the US, if you make less than ~$130k as an individual, you are allowed to contribute up to $6000 to this account per year. The money you put into is post tax money so already taxed. Any profits from the Roth IRA account are tax free, though there may be penalties if you withdraw before a certain age etc.Cant you still open your Own Roth IRA with an American bank in a private account?

I have a Roth IRA I fund myself with TD Ameritrade. I just opened the account by myself online.Or Kanye’s characterWas it your girl who got Jeff Bagwell’d?[deleted]It's like 1489 right now*short stock to offset losses*Should I expect it to touch 1800 anytime soon?  I guess my last hope is RobinHood community. They love Tesla.Yes, that's what I am hoping and the new factory and battery. Long term, so don't mind waiting but also don't want to wait forever.As I said, i am learning and I want to be a trader. I am not crying or complaining of buying it expensive. 

And trading or investing is a personal decision. Thanks for your 2 cents.You should not be giving advice about what to do with their money.Why would I need your guarantee? I didn't ask for your assurance?. Somehow people here are happy if you loose money.  What a sorry sorry bunch of people.Sorry, I replied to this. I actually thought this post was in r/wallstreetbetsThey are on track for an S&P500 listing. There will be no sell off, only buy up.Where did I say I was trying to time dips? I don't try to time them and never have.

I said I buy when dips happen, that's it. Did you even read my comment?For context, I’m 18 just graduated high school. I was already planning on moving out, but COVID sure fucked up school itself. I’m hoping that everyone would be better for second semester, or at least for summer classes but I’m fine with first semester because the stuff actually related to my major is software stuff for my first class(ME major) so a bit hard learning online but better than in person rn.oh stop it drama queen. The VIX didn't even get near the 79 that it reached in 08' (it topped out at 66 in march). It's bad, but it isn't Lehmann brothers and bear sterns liquidating, bad.AAPL had GOOD news? LMAO. Dude, do you watch any financial news? All they talked about today was BAD news for AAPL. Why do you think it dropped so much?

I owned XLK. QQQ outperformed it and recovered quicker after the drop and pays a dividend. Sold my XLK to buy more QQQThat makes sense to me! Thank you very much friend. Definitely gonna look into both of themDo you see arkk dropping more?I’m new to this as well, how much is to much to invest into XLK? What do you use to trade? I’m currently using Robin Hood but I’ve heard a mix of things. Any help is appreciated!the point i was making is that if you are sitting around with cash specifically to have it ready for a crash you really did not achieve that much since the returns you get from having that money in the market tends to outpace the what you gain by waiting for a crash. Or to put it another way if the market gain 8% on average and the crash is for 30% after 10 years  you missed out on 115% growth or 50% growth after the crash. that is before we consider timing risks because you probably won't buy the bottom.Exactly. Antibodies form extremely unreliable and only a few of the infected got them. A vaccine usually takes 2-8 years of time. Currently every scientist whose able to work on it is working on it but stuff like this is taking time. Thats just how science works.Ah, you are talking long term. That makes sense.That’s what they said about Enron. It was a blue chip stock, Arthur Andersen was a part of the big 5. Both went defunct in the same scandal. 

Lehman brothers - huge investing bank, too big to fail, gone with the 2008 crisis.

I agree, it’s not likely but it’s also not impossible.Yeah I see your point, it's definitely viable in this recession but very hard to predict in other types of recessions ig.It took me until I was 40 something (like last year, I think). My own ignorance never fails to surprise me.There’s also a sizable portion (perhaps most) of the US population that literally can’t spare $500/mo to invest. It’s not just a lack of knowledge, but a lack of capital.Yes, I mean I’m incredibly lucky to have parents that saved and can pay for my college and to have a well-paying internship despite COVID. Very very lucky. Not everybody, or even most people, have that so I can’t begrudge them. But I think it’s important to teach the fundamentals of compound interest and saving at a young age, and I think we still lack that in the U.S.Assuming markets increase in value significantly over those 20 years. There is no guarantee of that.But to have an American bank account I need to be american, right? Or live in the US?Perhaps youre not familiar with Portnoy... he chose to publicly shame his ex all over his website. He got his troll army to attack her instructor’s place of work. They made t-shirts and they had a catch phrase. THAT’s weird.

https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/the-barstool-sports-founder-got-cucked-and-its-everyones-fault-but-his-ownNow 1420...Not to put you down or anything, but I sold last week in 1500. And my good with my decision. I'm not saying you should sell, noone knows what happens, but definitely don't buy more right now.
Personally I think it will dip to 1000 before making progress again, but clearly I have no idea.90% of traders lose money. If you really want to be in that 10%, go for it. Personally, I think you're insane if you think you can beat the algorithms (do you even know what I mean when I say that?)>"That is, no single stock should exceed 5% of your capital.

>An extremely risk adverse portfolio also avoids big gains."

>WHY THE FUCK YOU GIVING THEM ADVICE ON WHAT TO DO WITH THEIR MONEY? IF THEY WANT TO BUY MORE THAN 5% OF A SINGLE STOCK YOU SHOULD LET THEM YOU ASSHOLEClicked on post history "buffet does not buy stocks" was first one to pop up

So, all those AAPL and KO shares just magically appeared in his holdings? lmaoLose* and no, i don't want you to lose money. I'm simply implying that if you continue to trade pump and dump penny stocks that you'll eventually lose.> when

That's timing, dude.  You don't know its a dip at the moment.I see. I'm in my late 20s and just so you're aware a LOT of us in my generation (tail end of Millennials) really regret our decisions when it comes to paying incredible amounts of money for degrees that didn't really produce a lot of opportunities. Comp Sci stuff is probably a good bet, but you also have to think about how that is also what so many other people are also doing, and a lot of them at a way higher level than you might be. I got my degree in Physics with a Mathematics minor. I was in the top 5% of my class at a major US university, a member of plenty of honors societies, 3.98 GPA, did research every summer, etc. And I still couldn't find a job in the field after looking for over a year because the job market was so saturated with people who had Masters Degrees and PhDs. BS degrees were simply not valuable, regardless of the qualifications.

I'm not discouraging you from going to college of course, but my advice would be to just be careful when it comes to student loans and money in general over the next 5 years. It's very easy right now to get into some serious debt, but you never know what's going to happen and that can hang over you for decades. I've been lucky to have been able to pay it off pretty consistently, but it really does suck just knowing it's there. I have family that are still paying off student loans 20 years later, and that was when college was cheap.

We were your age during the Great Recession and we still haven't recovered from it. Just look at home ownership, marriage, and birth rates among people in their late 20s and 30s. It's very possible your generation might go through what we did and are still, and maybe even to a greater extent. 

Just try to be smart and don't make any quick decisions. Again, best of luck.If I was coming fresh out of high school I would go this semester because you will be taking mostly gen ed classes anyways.  Just knock some of those out online.  But that’s mei'm not smart or expirienced enough to give a qualified opinion there... i honestly don't know. i bough in here because i figure if it does go down more it won't be a ton and this seemed like a safe place to buy and should swing as soon tesla starts swinging back up....which it will after yesterday's earnings report. 

thats about as much advice as i am comfortable giving .. just in case im really wrong ill feel bad because its not my money youre working with.

i felt good about buying here... i'll leave it at that. (because honestly i don't know lol)Buffet has lots cash and he never time market so you have no idea what you talking aboutIt’s just a stupid delusion imo and too many people have it. They think a vaccine is here by end of August. I don’t understand this type of logic. I thought I knew more about science than stocks anyways but I wanna know what these guys know that I don’tMy 401k and ira are longterm. Etfs and indexs i get into for decade plus are long term. Im talking 2 yearsWell yeah nothing is outside the realm of possibility.   But I cant see the aforementioned stocks going back down to where they were early march without an even more extreme world event than the covid.  We had that nasty dip a few weeks ago and that will probably be the bottom of the market for a while.Well, also, Enron and Lehman aren't even comparable to something like McDonald's or Walmart.

Lehman was based almost entirely on investing so dangerous itself.

Enron didn't even last 2 decades before it collapsed over fake budgets.

Again, no one is saying impossible, but anything like that happening with McDonald's is probably next to nothing.

If McDonald's dies, it'll likely be seen ahead of time.Better late than never.well I can’t spare $500/ month to invest so I’m not sure I see your point. Shouldn’t matter if it’s $50 or $500 the principle of compounding remains the sameNot necessarily, It depends where you live.

I would look into it man;

 Here, I posted a link that specify's the deets:

https://medium.com/@georgebenaroya/can-non-us-citizens-outside-the-us-open-a-brokerage-account-6171f705da38Wotta garbage personThe soulcycle guy cheated with his gf. All cheaters deserved to be shamed publicly.I will treat it as a total write off ad leave it there i guess. Eventually stock price will get there.Genius, just because you're doing it for longer,  you don't have the right to judge me.  I thought I wrote it in ENGLISH that I am "LEARNING". If I lose, it will be my money, Do you have a problem with that?  

And if that only 10 % are successful,  then yes, I will be one of the 10% with time.  I already said thanks for your 2 cents.  Don't need any more penny from you.You should read my comment history a little closer next time.Buffet buys companies, not stocks.*spelling mistake happens when you quickly type on a phone. 

All pennystock are not pump and dump.

Follow news, look for a catalyst for a stock to go up and invest when there are indicators for a move.

But thanks for your 2 cents....Investing money at anything but completely arbitrary moments in time is wrong. 

Okay, thanks for the advice!Trust me I’ve seen it it’s all over Reddit. Yeah I’m doing mechanical engineering and I’m pretty confident I can get me a decent job with that at least because the Major itself is pretty broad. But I’m gonna work my ass off because as a first gen college student son of two immigrants who didn’t even go to middle school. I’m already setting milestones so I’m just trying to get rich really, but like in a good way. And stocks are part of that journey but I wasted a lot the past few months on penny stocks. I’m still learning them but I’m not stupid about it anymore and because of my class schedule I can’t have an actual job My first semester so I’ll be studying a lot about stocks as well.That’s why I’m bearing it, I don’t have any “hands on” stuff for this year for mechanical engineering, just software stuff. Still sucks that they won’t lower tuition but I’m gonna try to negotiate my lease so I can spend part of my year at home not paying rentBuffet doesn't buy stocks.It’s Trump just lying in everyone’s faces until they believe it. Trump is the man in power but he won’t fuel the market forever. He can buy as many ‘‘vaccines‘‘ as he wants, he fucked up big time. Im sitting here waiting for the winter, quarantine number 2 is coming at least for the US. More and more people will loose their jobs worldwide. Big factories will close and there will still be no vaccine. Just wear your masks and stay inside while the economy is going down the drain. But that’s how our system works and unfortunately we can’t do anything about it.> down to where they were early march without an even more extreme world event than the covid

Or, hear me out here.  They do what is called a "market correction" and finally properly account for the extreme world event that is covid, and that is set to erase $9T from global GDP this year.  Stocks are way, way overvalued right now.  
  
Because there is so much liquidation and free money everywhere, that investors literally have nowhere else to try to hold their wealth.Even if I’m 28? Also, are we talking like a Roth over a 401k? Or separate Roth on top of a 401k? If the first, I thought it’s supposed to be better to do 401k because an employer can contribute more of a match to a 401k.50/mo is not enough to retire on, so yeah it matters.Thank you, I'll look into it!Remember when you contradicted yourself simply because you're a weird Portnoy Stan? First you say it was weird that the public cared about personal issues and then followed that up with "cheaters need to be publicly shamed", wow... that was dumb.Considering you have no idea if the guy was aware she wasn't single, that logic is extra dumb.I believe so too. When I bought I was confident in a 4000$ value in maybe 10 years. That is why I bought. Seeing how it surged so fast is mere luck and caused by speculation imo. But it will get there!What's your penny stock of choice?> Investing money at anything but completely arbitrary moments in time is wrong.

This is correct, despite your useless sarcasm.  You buy a stock because you believe in the fundamentals, and you intend to hold it in the long term.   
  
You can twiddle your thumbs while you wait for the "dip".  Meanwhile, tomorrow, or next week, the stock might move above where it is today and never return.  
  
As I said, your attempt to time the dips is only fooling yourself.  This has been proven over and over again across many investors trades.If you're majoring in mechanical engineering...you're gonna be all set my dude 👌🏾 (sincerely).


I looked into that major because the starting salary is high/theres a large demand,

and holy shit theres so much math.
its like you're life becomes math for a few years just to get through that major (hours a day studying equations and doing practice problems..)

When it comes to that Major..if I may quote Oscar from the 90's Nikolodian cartoon "Hey Arnold": 

"Susie, you can keep the money."-That's awesome. I'm sure your parents are going to be very proud of you. 

But yeah don't do penny stocks. So you're going to college and your expenses are about to skyrocket. Just regularly put money into index funds like VOO/VTI, maybe 5-10% in bonds like BND or BLV, and if you want some tech do VGT. Sure, it's not a sexy way to invest, but it is a **smart** way to invest. No, you're not going to make thousands of dollars like people who invested in Tesla did years ago. But you'll make consistent returns while minimizing risk over decades. This is what investing means.

I know it's hard to accept such a boring thing because you want to "get rich" but trust me you're not Warren Buffet. Getting "rich" from the market takes YEARS of spending every single day of your life studying companies and stocks. Do you have that time and energy? I don't think so.

You're going to college, not imitating Buffet. Put some money into index funds every month and forget about it. Spend your time learning and work your ass off with your education. Don't worry about the stock market.I agree there will be a correction coming. Probably the end of this year through much of next year.  Real estate is going to be massacred most likely.   I was speaking more in terms of the next few months.   But you can always buy and hold blue chip stocks and usually outperform people who think they can time the market.  You might have to hold through some ugly times but itll work out long termDo both if you can but the employer match is free money so I'd go for that first. I actually started Roth IRA around your age and have been contributing every year since then.Lol 50/ month for 30 years is 18k... in principle. You add in compound interest and its probably in the ballpark of like 40-50k. Certainly a respectable sum. And that all assuming you can only afford $50 a month for 30 years.I'll give you one for today - ABUS (Moved crazy pre market) .

Indicator: it won a lawsuit against Moderna.So you have 100% of your portfolio in equities at all times? You hold zero cash or any other positions? 

Because if what you're saying is correct why would you ever hold anything other than equities?

I hold cash as savings but it's also there to buy in the event there's a dip. It's not money I would otherwise be investing at this point. I have no idea why you are so ornery about this. Everyone does it.

I have never claimed to be trying to time the market. I have no idea why you keep saying that I have (are you drunk or something?). 

In any case this is my last response to you, your comments are very boring. 

I wish you the best.I’m gonna put a good chunk into stocks like you said, but I’m still gonna try to learn to trade on the side with a different account because besides engineering, investing is my side passion and if I had gotten into one of the top colleges, finance would had been a higher possibility for my career. And I’ll also trade with a paper trading account as well.I can’t tell if you are serious are not. In what world can you retire on 50k?That's not a penny stock. They are a half billion dollar company listed on the Nasdaq> I hold cash as savings but it's also there to buy in the event there's a dip.

> I have never claimed to be trying to time the market.   
  
Ok there guy.[deleted]You are insufferableLol and there's a reason why you didn't answer any of my questions. 


Goodnight buddy!And I’m telling you your assumptions don’t hold up for a large portion of the US population. Personal finance 101: “max out 401k contributions, start a Roth, set aside a 6 month emergency fund” is not feasible for most Americans. That compound interest isn’t going to help substantively if you can’t afford 500/mo until you are 40, because you are paying 900/mo for student loans, 400/mo for health insurance, plus housing and basic living expenses.Thank you, I have no idea what this guy's problem with me is."If you're taking screen shots, it's time to sell." -best reddit investing advice I've ever seen.Nice!

I'm hoping to get that back!I'm curious about your EMAN holdings.  What prompted you to buy this stock?“Skate to where the puck is going”Nice gains. Be sure to pocket some of them and live to tell another tale.Sucks that all those gains were lost today. Hope you closed your positions early.DIS is Solid. This is Dis as a Theme Park, a Movie Production company, A hotel, a entertainment company, a copyright owner and a online Netflix type rental movie service company ALL for 115 Dollars.

AMD I don't know your buyin price but I would probably sell is around this price or maybe for little more and walk away.
Problem they AMD is it's not INTL Nor is it NVIDIA. 
Yes I know if you read they say it will hit 60 or 65 but  what does it offer or what does it do to sustain that price. 
I think its basically riding the wave of INTL APPL and Nvda. Just happens to be a part of winning sector.
I honestly I'm looking for 58 to 60 to get out . ( issue is we have seen 2 58 in the last 6 weeks issue is it then recedes to 52 ish . 
Btw my purchase price is 43.Which platform do you use? Congrats on that %!!The womenfolk never care even if it is funding them.Lost me at the girlfriend part. Does it matter that your gf cares....? Seriously. Some of us can’t even get a date, be happy you are in a relationshipWhat app does he use?Nice! Here is 1 more tip for you. Watch this! [Best performing stocks ](https://youtu.be/BOsxgKk2tXY)what's the name of the app ?Way to go!So true.  I was up 70% on a LLNW call about a week from expiry, got greedy and took screenshots, and ended up selling at -50% or soI have screenshots of tesla stock when it $400. then $750. Then $1000. then $1,500.I did a screen shot when I was up $3k, to share with family who started investing along with me, following week drops to $1k smh!Not really though. A lot of your positions should be long-term in which case you only sell when 1) you need the money or 2) the fundamentals change.I take screenshots of my portfolio most days. Going to be really fun to look back on in a few years to see all my positions and how they evolved over timePays to " skim some of the cream" Said from a risk adverse 70 yo, probably too much so, at +10% on short term holdings I'm out of here.Additionally, nothing is wrong with setting a trailing stop and letting the position work itself out, once you've hit a target % gain.This advice has helped me a lot since I heard it a few weeks ago.your gf might not care but your wife willPuts on $GF?She’ll care once you go yacht shoppingGot mine into trading too so HA !!#2 hit so hard.

That last sentence should be the motto of the subreddit.More money = bigger wins, bigger losses, and the cool rationality you formerly had leaks out your asshole because it's so nerve wrackingi actually sold out of my positions. Figured i got my 1 free win. Gonna cash out and switch to long term investing. options is too stressful.This is the advice you needUhhh nope. Sold them at open this morningsuggestion from a close friend.nothing hes said has steered me wrong yet.All positions were closed by 845am. So I realized all those gains. Felt good too.>Problem they AMD is **it's not INTL** Nor is it NVIDIA. Yes I know if you read they say it will hit 60 or 65**but what does it offer or what does it do to sustain that price.**

Not sure if serious or trollingNot true.Some of us women have been investing for years. Women should have financial literacy, regardless of whether they’re married and especially if they’re not.Don't worry. Its just like the market. Peaks and valleys my my dude. Some of us just have longer dips.RobinhoodRobinhoodI know that feeling all too well.LLNW was the free stock robinhood gave me a year ago for signing up... wish I had just bought a bunch of that instead of all the autistic moves I  made from information on this subI bought LLNW on a whim and was up 100% before I had a come to Jesus moment to GTFOLLNW hit my stop loss this morning, kind of buggered about itHe has 3 options expiring in a week and a half that are making up the vast majority of his profits.This is my Sunday ritual.  I have all my stocks broken down by sector and I like to compare how much the overall value has gone up as well as returns.  Gives me something to do when the market is closed, and helps me decide if I will make any moves on Monday when my weekly deposit goes in.

90% of my portfolio is long-term though, so usually I just end up killing some time reassuring myself of my decision to invest in the companies I've chosen or I bump up the allocation to a specific sector by a percent or two in order to force M1 to buy into those sectors.Yup! If you managed 1% every trading day for a decade with $500 contributions monthly, you'd be obscenely rich by the end of the decade.My wife doesn’t care but my girlfriend does.my husband cares, but my girlfriend doesn’tMy wife doesn’t really care :/It's ok, bro, we are here for you.

I blew up my account past couple of weeks from not taking profits and made one last purchase last week with my last 250 before I have to put more money in. I cashed out 2/3 of my position for ~900 today and I'm going to let the other 1/3 ride a little longer. Now even if the other 1/3 goes to shit I still have some money to make moves. I'm still very new and learning as I go.Bro honestly your comment is Very cringe.Meme.Its reddit, always assume meme.Can’t tell if name checks out as meme or rudeYeah, but when your account is worth $80 I don’t really want to hear about the percentages lolNot to shit in your cheerios, but all you learned was that you can get lucky by following advice from a random redditor. That's a lesson that is likely to bite you in the end.Yeah, it's easy to swallow a 20% loss on your portfolio when it's only about $400.  Decades later when that 20% is $400,000 you'll probably need the prior decades' worth of investing experience to stomach the (hopefully temporary) loss and not sell.

Having a large amount in your portfolio is just as much a curse as a blessing.Good idea.  Options are complicated.  I'm not gonna mess with them until I have a couple of years under my belt of normal investing.What the hell in INTL? You mean INTC, or international or .... y'all don't even know the symbols your putting money into.It's just a joke.

Congrats on the gainsYeah.. something good in Europe?I bought 10 shares of LLNW. Made $30 and holdingLLNW I got in really low thanks to a reddit post over a year ago. I sold at 5.25, but man I wish I held longer! Still, made several thousand.It’s true. My friend managed 0.1% every trading day. And just after 3 years, he became a millionaire by marrying a billionaire’s daughterI like how you were going the math route but then gave up.I don't think you realize how absurdly outside of reality those numbers are.If you could do that and started with $1, while never adding more contributions, you’d have $63,6 billion after a decade.
It’s not reasonable to expect 1% per day. At all.Sure, but very few people manage that. I’m happy  that I’ve been taught that 1% per month is also good, achievable and can bring in a lot of money together with some frugality.Duh. 1% daily gain is insanely much.

Even 0.01% a day is around 26% a yearWhat do you guys mean manage 1%? Not 1% stop losses? Sorry kinda of new to trading.Question on this. My present portfolio is averaging 1-1.5% a day. I am not invested in the Nasdaq. Is this considered a decent return? What would be considered a decent return?

Edit: It's only been averaging this over a month period, but yes up 1ish % daily. Oh yes, it has most definitely shot up. Half the portfolio is invested in gold.That's okay, the girlfriend is more impressed by money, that's what makes her the girlfriend.my girlfriend's husband doesn't care but her boyfriend doesmaybe the third stringer will careBrrrr-menTSLA has definitely treated me wellAh ok fair enough.

TSLA is basically a pennystock lolYeah I plan too see how the premarket moves and if it trends upward ill ride for a minute or two but second it trends downward im out.

I got 5.9 quadrillionFor a guaranteed 26% a year, I would liquidate all 4 of my portfolios and never look back.[deleted]No one manages 1-1.5% a day lol.

Thanks for the precise number 👍🏼Too many assumptions hereYou want to at least pay attention to delta and theta if you're playing with options. Options are risky and there's a reason why they're initially locked on RH. Also, by technicals I mean reading different indicators on the charts to predict where the price will go to base my decisions like my entry/exit point. Your options move based on the stock price so you can apply the technicals to trading options.I’m pretty sure he meant if his position was let’s say $100 and he set his own rules to sell at -15%  to cut losses. If at open his position tanks then he sells to avoid any further loss, and avoids being left bag-holding. 

This leaves the guess work out of his trading. He won’t let his emotions stop him from taking a profit, or cutting a loss because he follows a strategy.

Hope this helps!No. Greeks are not "technicals". Those are two completely separate things.Do the have a IPOThe University of Illinois is doing this too - [https://abc7chicago.com/illinois-coronavirus-covid-19-covid-test-testing/6307680/](https://abc7chicago.com/illinois-coronavirus-covid-19-covid-test-testing/6307680/) . Make testing more widespread and accessible while being less invasive? I'm down for that. Businesses and people both win.Ok but what does this mean for Tesla?The problem with a saliva test is the accuracy.  Companies have played with the idea of saliva, but so far, have not been able to attain the high accuracy rates needed.  The nasopharyngeal swab is the most accurate way to test.  

A Canadian company called Sona Nanotech has developed a rapid nasopharyngeal swab producing results in 5-15 mins with 96% accuracy.  


https://youtu.be/wnRW94aruKkI have swabbed people for Covid-19 and twice I used a spit method, I feel like the swab in the nose is a better test based on the ones I have used. I as the tester have more control. One of the spit tests I did was green. I said wtf? The man being tested just laughed and said it Mountain Dew. What a twat.Is this UK government sponsored testing? I don’t see any specific company name given.I spoke with my doctor a week ago and he said if I wanted a test I could do one but he'd have me do the saliva test because it's just as accurate.

Is this cheaper or something?  I don't understand how it's different than what's available.Looks great for the most part but a lot of obstacles. Getting everyone to comply is a big issue. Even a small group unwilling would make this almost useless and most countries don't have the balls to make it mandatory. Then there's the fact this won't stop social distancing, I don't know why they said that. This is not a cure, this is just a fast test. This is not a replacement for social distancing, you can still very much infect someone regardless of whether you know you are infected sooner or not so that was pretty dumb to say.

This is great solely for the speed of the test, hopefully it is as reliable as it is fast.I want tenCalls on epicenter stoxThey gonna give it to bus drivers too?So... what’s the ticker?NVDA is a speculation bubble rn, imo.This should be in r/worldnewsBD just came out with a 15 min one - I think I will bank on them tyvm.Thought this was r/disneyvacationWhat stock is this?Cool, but I feel like stocks are already priced for a 100% open economy, so I'm still going to sit out.

October- November will be the time to buy.NGL i really thought that image was NSFW. Looks weird to zoom into the mouth so much.Sounds amazing, a very simple test every week to help contain the outbreak. 

But I am sure we here in America will die protecting our freedom before adapting this.Sadly, no game gets changed with molecular tests. And antibody (and rare antigen) rests still can barely tell if someone’s ever had covid—dependent upon the severity of their immune response. 

And 20mins vs. one day is nice... if 5billion people are testing themselves every day. But daily testing for over half of the planet isn’t realistic—though silly Americans who represent less than 1/2000 people in the world always like to think the rest of the world looks and functions like Sacramento.

I mean, daily testing *is* realistic in the same sense that stocks only go up.

🌈🐻is there an associated ticker to this? Anyone know?A swab in my urethra was pretty uncomfortable, along with a liver biopsy. Both were far worse for me.If this test has an even .5% miss rate, could be disastrous though.And how exactly would this be the end to social distancing?

Maybe better in a coronavirus sub.Saliva testing? I've been doing this weekly for 2 weeks now, its free by my employer. You just spit into a straw a few times to fill up a vial. Takes about 5 minutes in and out the front door, results 24h later. If you can find it, do it! Highly recommend.Man seeing people spit makes me gag. I hate this.

The test of everyone weekly is what is supposed to eliminate the disease completely, thereby eliminating the need for all the precautions.

If by chance they could check for other diseases from the same sample, it would be an added bonus as well.Kevin?Not political enough for /r/worldnews.U can have a look at sona and dmOnly looks weird if you’ve already googled your thousandandth bukkakeThis gives the results in 20 min apparently.

If it is reliable and it works then awesome. Especially if I can spend my time treating patients instead of swabbing them.Got tested yesterday, it is wildly unpleasant.There are different swabs, for awhile some did not need to reach that far but their results were not as accurate. The deeper swab is uncomfortable and hopefully anyone who needs it has a person with experience doing the swab. Slow and steady is the way to go. If the spit test is more accurate then of course it should be use first. Hopefully that is the test the facility doing the testing has, the insurance takes and the lab uses. I don’t know who swabbed you but it should be only kind of uncomfortable, there are several test I would consider worse. I hope your test comes back negative and you never need another one.Oh my gosh it wasn’t that bad. It didn’t even hurt. Yes it was uncomfortable and awkward but it was very quick and worth it. Not knowing and potentially spreading this disease is a way worse than the thirty seconds of being slightly uncomfortable.A weekly test is no better at curing you of covid than the current test though. It is just a test to see if you are infected or not. I don't see how having consistent weekly tests will somehow destroy the currently incurable virus? Just like social distancing, it will all come down to peoples willingness to participate. 

So as I said the speed of the test imo is the only great take away from the article. It can potentially lead to international flying being reopened, by having a test maybe 2-3 days before flight and a 2nd test in the airport to confirm results of the previous test. That alone would be huge. Just my opinion.Well, they collect them in batches and process them en masse.... that’s why the 24h. It’s also for people that are not symptomatic, to streamline their process.There’s like 100s of “potential” vaccines, yet we got nothing

Factories, hospitals, schools, etc. By implementing a routine and rapid testing regimen, they can virtually eliminate spread and maintain normal operations. In hotspots, companies are struggling to hire. Workers are getting concerned and walking out. Anything would be better than the current situation.A weekly test will not cure anyone. It is, like the name - a test.

&#x200B;

But if you instead of keeping distance, stay home, because you know that you're sick, then there is a lot higher chance that you will not infect anyone. If you do not infect anyone, then the disease will stop existing.

&#x200B;

If it is made mandatory, then it is not up to people willingness, more than it is up to peoples willingness not to murder people, that we do not die.

&#x200B;

Difference is that we cannot prove that somebody is a murderer, but we can see the people who haven't been tested and bar their windows.

Traveling in itself is afaik not a big factor in infections, but I might be wrong in that.Right let me educate you..
The European Union is not a country like the United States... this lazy thinking leads to so much complacency by us investors not understanding the fragility of the eurozone(which is not Eu wide either).
The Eu is comprised of 27 nations not states.. each with their own laws and customs, joined by being secular Christian majority countries. 
Ryan airs biggest market is the U.K.. the biggest countries that recieve visitors are Spain (in the Eu????? Crazy I know) Italy and Greece... all of which have had draconian quarantines over the last quarter.. if you think Ryan air an airline that depends on volume is gonna have done well during this then you are drunk.. the outspoken chairman even hinted at desperation suggesting anyone who asked a refund not be allowed to book again.. 

And like you said “Europe is doing the best out of this” and it’s true all European nations put up severe quarantine restrictions and lockdowns on their citizens... hence nobody flew anywhere.Europe is the continent EU is the european union not to be mixed with Europe.   

Why you may ask? Norway for an example does not belong to EU but is in Europe, and etc.

I was in the corner crying from all the contrarian programmers turned traders being mean to me 😥Don’t worry, we could already tellLarge investors like Berkshire use a handful of banks/brokers to discretely buy/sell their positions within a few days or weeks not minutes. These bankers will shop around in dark pools or other clients looking for a match on the other side of the trade. The big fish trade with other big fish. There are times when the company itself is open to selling shares as a block to one investor. The bankers/brokers carefully approach many potential suitors without disclosing their client. These large trades cant get done on an electronic exchange cause they are just too big. These are all done over the phone or face to face and get reported on the exchange as required.They have accounts with investment banks. Buffett and Berkshire's is Citigroup, IIRCProbably RobinhoodMostly through investment banks or “clearing houses” (depending on cases/amounts)Many of them have trading positions on the exchange or they go thru a bank or firm to do it. They usually buy or sell over time as to not jack the price around too much.I don’t think Berkshire always buys from the stock market (he does for quite a few). They can approach a company and deal with them directly. Thus he can get super cheap bargains especially non listed which us peasants can’t get.Warren Buffett uses Thinkorswim for data, and Robinhood for executing orders.If you have a LLC or a corporation you can open an account with most major firms and trade like normal. Some fees are higher and business are taxed much differently.I dont think anyone actually knows how Buffett does it.  For one thing if anyone saw him buying or selling something it would cause a massive market change in the security.  He sold 10% of each of the airlines before anyone knew at all.   Secrecy is key and he aint gonna tell you his broker.They use RobinhoodIt depends on the type of transactions , they can buy directly so they don’t have to pay a fee but they prefer to keep the relationships with the banks / financial institutions so they get first dibs on bankruptcy proceedings, IPOs , Sale of the companies etc,. They , however, have to disclose all of these transactions by filing 5 different kinds of documents. If you wanted to see the balance sheet and you are not a client then you will have to wait until certain forms are filed like 8-K & Section -16 . All publicly traded companies have to disclose transactions by certain time , set by SEC , along with a detailed description during Earning Calls.What’s the word on the street about SOFI?Mostly joke or terrible answers here.

It is important to first understand how a company raises money. Imagine the FAT company who currently has the initial owner and a few (thousand) employees. Their total share count is 1,000,000. The initial owner has 80% of the shares and the rest of the employees share the 20%. If they want to raise money, they ISSUE NEW SHARES. 


Investment bankers then determine a valuation for the company, lets say $25m. Therefore, each share is worth $25. If the company wants to raise $5m, they would need to create 200,000 new shares and convince someone to buy them ('the open market'). Success! They do it.

NOW, the company has a total of 1,200,000 shares, the owner still has 800,000, the employees 200,000, and these new owners from the market own 200,000. The price is still $25/share, and the company is now worth $30m (until the share price fluctuates). The company was worth $25m, but they now have $5m in cash from the issuance of new stock, which is why they are now worth more (Same $25m + new $5m cash = $30m total, OR, 1m shares *25 + 200k shares *25 = 1.2m * 25 = $30m total).


So to get to your question, how do investment firms invest into COMPANIES (because stock/shares/etc. is just partial ownership of a company). They SOMETIMES by on the market, but usually not, and when they do, they often do it through derivatives (like an option). 


But more often, they buy those new shares, the IPO shares. Warren Buffett, for instance, often negotiates a new class of stock, Preferred Stock, where he is paid a dividend. He likely negoatiates further, and wants convertability to be a part of it, where he can share in the upside if the company does exceedingly well. 


Investment firms like BRK have trouble investing because they need to make such large purchases. Anything under $100m for BRK is nearly a waste of time, and everything above that amount is more highly scrutinized. It is easy to buy a mom-and-pop shop for pennies on the dollar, but much more difficult to buy coca-cola.


Berkshire Hathway, and Icahn Enterprises, etc. (though I much prefer BRK...), operate similarly to a Private Equity fund. They find more unique deals, and because they are the 900lb Gorilla, are able to throw their weight around. When Goldman Sachs may have gone under, they ISSUED NEW SHARES to BRK so that they could raise money and stay afloat.


Does this help? I am happy to answer other questions you have... I teach finance to Wall Street professionals.FDs on six different Robin Hood accounts using Bill gates credit card.Investment Banks.Mostly investment banks or trading firms or prop trading firms that accept order flow from customers.Does Schwab allow you to buy delisted and OTC stocks and Warrants?

Basically two big parties reach a deal and a price and make the trade. For example, Buffet  bought warrants to get shares of Bank of America (I am not 100% sure if this is the company)  in exchange for giving a loan to bail out during 2008 crisis.  Nice, thanks for the great post!They use the Robinhood appThey use OTC trading, known as over the counter where two parties meet to trade financial instruments. If they want to make big exchanges, sometimes bigger than any stock exchange could handle, or they want to remain anonymous or the price is sometimes not disclosed to the public so they can keep it a secret. Also not all companies are listed on exchanges.

Less common is dutch auction where seller is auction away their financial instruments and where investors bids for the amount to buy and sell.

Firms also use brokers or investment banks to trade on the exchanges. But if they want to purchase a large amount they usually want to do OTC since a large amount of shares being bought up will drive up the stock price.I heard they also sell lots of put options, so if the stock price increases they get to keep the premium from selling the put option. If it drops in that time they're forced to buy the stock at a higher price, but they want to own it for the long term anyways.They use Robinhood GoldOften by selling putsBuffett doesn’t invest in companies... he buys themAcornsr/WallsteetbetsThey do an analysis first to decide, whether they should buy it. For example they determine, whether that company is a stable company making good profit in the long run. Then they determine the intrinsic value to decide, whether that stock is undervalued or overvalued. 

That part I don’t agree. That’s why I do things differently. Lol. Watch this! [Best performing stocks ](https://youtu.be/BOsxgKk2tXY)Is Robin Hood Federally insured ?

I HATE YOU but secretly attracted to you .LolOnly thing I would add is that some of them meet with the CEO/CFO/board to negotiate buying stock from the company. It's kind of rare, but I think this is what Buffett did to get some of his APPL stock.Clearing houses don’t execute trades.They do pre-programmed buys and sells generally. So it might be an order to buy or sell 10,000 shares per day, and they will continue to buy or sell additionally with a series of confidential rules. So it could be to buy 10,000 shares per day, but allow for double the rate of buying if the price falls over 2%, and triple if it falls over 3%. 

The firms are required to file SEC forms to disclose their stakes. On occasion, they’ll request a waiver from disclosing so people won’t try to jump ahead of their trade. The big guys still all complain about collocated servers which can cost them a lot of money. 

Additionally, big investors buy and sell from a dark pool, which will trade big lots anonymously. The bigger the transaction, the better they’re able to negotiate the price, which is why sometimes you’ll see a print that is way above or below the current price and then it snaps back to the price.Ahhh! Great minds think alike!Even if you don't have an LLC account but a personal account and you are an officer if you're LLC you can declare the contents of the account as company assets that you are managing for the companyI'm sure people knew, but their jobs depend on discretion and they probably have some very serious NDAs built in, too, preventing them from blabbing to people.Buffett said he is not buying any stock during the pandemic, it only hit the news when he made billions from selling apple that he bought during pandemic. Buffett is not your friend neither responsible for your portfolio. No point following him closely because by the time you know what he is doing, its already too late for you to repeat it.is it a joke? (asking without sarcasm)Kanye uses Mark Zuckerberg'sYesNot what he is askingWhat did this have to do with the OP? Also Robinhood maybe covered against broker-dealer failure, but the main complaints I hear against them are around their platform being down for long periods of time.It’s easier to be rich than poor. Rich people aren’t any happier than poor people. 

Mc Donald’s screws up your order. You’re sad. 

Fancy restaurant is packed and your party can’t be seated / screws up your order. You’re sad. 

You adjust quick. Your demands increase. Your needs increase. Lottery winners are sad.It's true.  Rich people shit.  But you don't have to be rich for that. Take a look at my cousin:  he's broke; shits all the time.Wouldn't that stress you out?Remember what biggy said, ‘Mo money Mo problems’.hey it's me tonny.You spelled “mommy” wrongSo Warren might be like, "I don't know about buying that stock, but let me call my buddy (BD), he's an expert at this."> What are the alternatives?

Literally any of the actual brokerages (Fidelity, TDA, CS, Vanguard).Charles Schwab has some of the best customer service I’ve seen. The app isn’t as simplistic as RH but it gets the job done.Use TDA. everything is free like robinhood, minus options trades (65 cents per trade, who gives a shit)I honestly don’t know the answer to that question as I’ve never used RH... but as others have said, literally any other broker. No major broker charges commission on stock trades anymore so if that was the attraction originally, then what’s left now? :)

What makes me cringe personally is that from what I have seen and heard, there is absolutely no way to reach a human being there for customer service besides sending them an email/message and crossing your fingers that they respond within a week or two. So if all is fine and rosy and you never ever need any assistance whatsoever with any of the investments or other issues that your $30k is involved in, then great, but the moment a situation arises where you need help from your broker and you need it quick (and these things do happen), you’re basically screwed.

Some of the major brokers like TDA and E-Trade now have long hold times when you call them after the covid rush, but even if you have to stay on hold for an hour, at least you can ultimately speak to a person, and there are other ways to reach them such as via live chat or secure messaging where you can get a fairly quick response. As far as I know, there is no such option with RH. And there are many other reasons also, that’s just one that I am pointing out.

Personally I feel RH may be good for starting out for someone playing with a few 100 bucks to get a feel of things in the market, but anytime someone’s investment capital crosses into 4 figures, let alone almost mid 5-figures like yours at $30k, it’s time to go to a real broker.I stopped using them when I found out I couldn't set up a beneficiary/transfer on death. I've had to be the probate administrator for two relatives that died without account beneficiaries and no will. It's awful and costs thousands of dollars in lawyer fees. 

You're going to die. Plan ahead and make at least the administrative part of it easier for those you leave behind.In my personal opinion it’s not dangerous unless you are trading short dated options. The app is a lot easier to use than anything else I’ve tried and there aren’t fees. The downside is they make money off of you trading by selling order flow, and the fact that it is so easy to buy and sell makes you more likely to do so. Therefore the real risk is that there are no barriers to trading, it really is almost too simple and too easy for you to FOMO or panic sell. Luckily I’m pretty okay at controlling myself. 

Interactive brokers is another good one, and I’ve thought about switching to their from Robinhood. Only thing stopping me is that I also use Robinhood as my bank account now and it would be a hassle to switch everything over.Plenty of other sites out there. Charles Schwab, fidelity, Edward Jones, etcThere are many proper brokerages you can go through.   


Robinhood is famous for crashing, delaying (or just refusing) trades for numbers of hours. Its a very flawed app that a few wsb users took advantage of and earned millions, they made national news by finding a glitch in robinhoods options trading.   


Other brokers (or just etfs/managed funds) tend to be a bit more reliable and have much better service and support rather than robinhood.   


Robinhood is scummy because they make money off of people not knowing what theyre doing. They let you buy options without even teaching you what options are. People (not just people, kids, children) are getting themselves in tens of thousands of debt because Robinhood takes advantage of their ignorance.

I made the change from a trading app (similar to RH) over to a proper broker once my portfolio grew to a size that I would be emotionally scarred if I lost it (especially if I lost it due to something dumb like their servers being too slow and not letting me place a trade). For me this was at about 50k and then I knew it wasn't worth the risk so I transferred and I am so glad I did.I use Robinhood for buying and selling stocks when they started. Didn’t have any problems at all.> What are the alternatives?

I've been using M1 Finance and pretty happy with it. It's definitely not a day trading platform like Robin Hood is though.For regular stocks? Robinhood is fine but there main benefit was no fees and most brokerages are doing that nowYeah dude, free fidelity brokerage. They are just sticklers about letting you do options.The problem is not Robin Hood, but the investors behind their accounts and how they manage their own money. However, I would recommend Interactive Brokers.So many comments, if youre a buy and hold, as long as you’re not trading everyday at 9:30am then its rly not a big deal they havent had that many outtages in recent memory. People with short dated options got fucked but when that happened i remember fidelity, tda, webull all of them had issues with bandwidth and filling orders. 


Robinhood gets a lot of shit bc of the lack or history but tbh the fact other companies wont spend the money for a real ux friendly app sucks since theyre too boomer to think they can profit off a redesign and im always down to let people who cant keep up fail. What DOES suck is that rh does kind of suck at important times. But i guess the most important takeaway is so does everyone else when theres historic volume moved aroundRobinhood doesn’t hold your funds, they use a third party clearing firm.  Apex last time I checked.

This would not be as well protected as a broker backed by a bank who did their own clearing & custody.  The banks will get bailed out in a crisis where independent clearing houses are less likely to.

Either way, make sure your broker is a member of SIPC for $250-500k of insurance.I'm a huge fan of TDA.It’s never wise to use RH now, too many better alternatives. RH may not be very dangerous but it’s unreliable at best.

Ally, Vanguard, TDameritrade, CS, and probably 1000 or so more better optionsYou can use robinhood to trade at any level. It's just how you trade or invest differs in platform.Schwab. Best phone support I've found. Have a TD TOS account too. Like the app, but takes an hour to get anyone on the phone.

You are lucky to get an email response from RH in a few days. Phone support non existent.Did you just start yesterday? you haven't heard of fidelity or schwab or anything besides RH?Have you not heard the horror stories of unlimited options on RH? One killed literally killed himself because of it. 

His fault too, but it’s so easy a moron can use it. It also means, it’s so easy morons can use it.BrandsBuffet also "does have time for negotiations" if he doesnt get the deal he wants he moves on. Trader i will say operate different than investors. Investors are anteplopes of finance trader are cheetahs. They just play the same field different.FYI he bought all the Apple prior to the pandemic and hasn’t sold much according to anything that has been released.Yeah it isOfc it's a joke, try moving a couple of billions through Robinhood.Yeah, the big players would use large Investment Banks or Brokerages. Someone else in this thread mentioned that Buffet uses Citi.Hedonic treadmill? A tendency of a human to quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness despite major positive or negative events or life changes.I see what you're saying, but there's a waterline.

I've gone days without a shower for long periods of time (showering once a week or so) and it made me generally miserable.  As soon as I was able to shower daily or every other day my mental state greatly improved.

I've never been starving, but if you can't keep your blood sugar up I imagine it's even worse.

If you can't take care of your basic needs, you are more "sad" than if you can, even accounting for the general recalibration to new circumstances we have.

So yeah if I'm able to shower and put food on my table maybe I won't be too much happier with a lot more money, but I'd be more miserable with a lot less.Money can't buy happiness, I'd still rather be unhappy while having a billion dollar bank account instead of unhappy with $5 to my name.Here's the way a I see it: money just affords you a new set of problems and challenges. Poor people have the obvious challenges like affording food and housing. Wealthier people don't have those challenges, but are faced with others like protecting their wealth, managing investments, strenuous and complex workloads, and the like.

A lot of people think all their problems can be solved with money, but what they don't understand is that it doesn't mean there won't be new problems on the other end. It's easy to hate wealthier people because we have been conditioned to hate them for having it "better" than others. The reality is that wealthy people can be just as miserable as poor people, albeit for different reasons.

I have everything I could ever realistically want. I have a nice house, a nice car, a healthy family, a business,  solid savings/retirement funds, and more. However, I am fucking miserable. Sure, I don't have to worry about being evicted or how I'm going to feed my family, but I have a mountain of responsibility that a lot of people who aren't in my position will never understand.> Rich people aren’t any happier than poor people. 

Yeah, I'm gonna disagree on that. Nobody says that rich people are constantly happy and never sad, but having shitton of money changes A LOT in your life, reducing your overall stress (unless you actively and willingly pursue it) and boosting your health as you can afford much better care in that regard.I like the saying "money can't buy happiness, but it can get rid of a lot of problems which make you unhappy."> Rich people aren’t any happier than poor people.

Yeah, but they're usually less unhappy.Yea but rich people don’t ever have to worry about being sad over not being able to pay rent. Or having to order off the dollar menu at said McDonald’s cause after bills there’s only $5 left in their account for the rest of the week. The struggles of the poor way outmatch a messed up order or rich people’s other “demands”His mommy doesn’t say no often, thowell daddy usually is the one who pays for everything...hm.I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding about what I am talking about.\+1 for Fidelity. Left RH after the first big outage when covid was first hitting the US markets. Haven't looked back. Not as pretty, but gets the job done. Still use RH for news though, haven't found a decent alternative there yet.I love TD Ameritrade, been using for a few years now. Multiple accounts with various purposes. I literally only use RH when I want to invest in a partial stockAre any of these available outside of the US? (Please say yes)Webull is greatWhat about the learning curve coming from basic stock trading from RH to Charles? Would I be able to “get it” in one week?Good customer service agreed but app is hard to use cant set trailing stop loss unless on Smartedge also stop limits for total shares at point of buyingI lost 650 dollars just for trading too much! Helpppp?!? is what I’d end up saying.[deleted]You should give a huge shit when you're making any play with 100 contracts or more you waste a massive chunk of cash on fees like a poker rake that make its 2x harder to make money with.Option traders are no different than sports gamblers.Thank you. Your insight is much appreciated.I got into trading with Robinhood but I only ever use it for short term swing trades whenever I have a good hunch on just a couple hundred dollars. I'm interested to hear thoughts on M1 Finance, that's where I have my real investments, a dividend focused account and then my Roth IRA. Thoughts? I personally think that while they're relatively new they get the job done\^\^\^\^My dad taught me to try to always learn one amazing insight every day.....

this feels today's\^\^\^\^\^My acct recently crossed into 5 figures and I've been debating getting out of RHYou use Robinhood as your bank account? Jeez... I stopped using them for my brokerage once TDA went commission free but back then their customer support was non existent. Has it gotten better where you can actually reach someone?Thank you.Quick research shows that all those charge fees for small trading and not all offer fractional shares.It is not robinhood's fault that people don't know what they are doingDamn and I can't even be bothered to change a market order to a limit order.ok brb ttylHappiness is a correlation between outside world and your expectation. If you expect a lot having a lot — u are unhappy. If you expect just to eat food and be alive — you would be happy even being very poor. 

So when you win a lottery, or become rich — your expectations grow accordingly. But becoming very rich at a time or winning a lottery is an extraordinary case. Averaging to mean from math says that you can’t all the time win lotteries or making crazy profits. So in result your expectations grew according to your maximum state of the world you lived in (your biggest gains), and therefore you are unhappy.There was a study a while ago that found that once someone earns over $75k/yr, extra money doesn't make them any happier.

http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2019628,00.html

I'm sure the value has changed over the past decade, but the point stands that money does buy happiness up to a certain point, but having more money than that doesn't necessarily increase happiness.Really? Because having $5 now means jack as you can build wealth yet you can't reliably build happiness. "fundamental misunderstanding"Woosh [https://funnyjunk.com/funny\_pictures/539246/Pawn/](https://funnyjunk.com/funny_pictures/539246/Pawn/)100% this.

I ditched RH after the Covid Fiasco to Fidelity. Once Fidelity went zero-commission and fractional-shares long before RH, there was no really no reason to stay with RH especially if you’re going to be locked out of buying stocks during a dip.

The app is definitely not as pretty or flexible but like you said it gets the job done.

> haven't found a decent alternative there yet.

Webull seems to be an alternative I’ve heard good things about, but it’s owned by a Chinese company which makes me nervous to use it though.I've found the news to be very limited at RH, and wish  there was more articlesCheck out Atom Finance...I like it's platform and it's free. You can access any documents, analysis, notifications on portfolio and watch list moves, can chat with others. 

I also use Yahoo for articles.Download the yahoo finance app for news its great it also has a forum to discuss about each stock-1 to fidelity. I tried adding a bank account to my account so i could fund it for like 3 days. Used 4 different browsers across 2 different machines and every time i just got stuck in an unending loading screen. My friend had the same issue. Made a Vanguard account instead and never looked backHave you used the research section on Fidelity. It is more (a lot more) extensive compares to RHTDA has good newsBenzingo pro fam.Can swap Vanguard with Fidelity imoIn all seriousness, a well curated Twitter feed is the single best news source.That's just a clone of robinhood. All the same risks applyJeez lotta webull haters lmao, curious why?Schwab is super easy.

The all-in-one trade ticket UI — which combines trading of stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, and options — looks like [this](https://stockbrokers.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/di87f5h/Charles%20Schwab%20order%20ticket.png?t=1457125707647) in its simplest form. They have the basics — stop limits, trailing stop, etc., plus [advanced orders](https://topratedfirms.com/images/1/charles/schwab-trade-ticket.png) (only trade if certain conditions are met). They also have a trading platform called StreetSmart which is a desktop app with realtime feeds, charting, and so on.

Schwab is great, but it's an old-school brokerage — which is ironic, seeing as they were the original discount brokerage that disrupted the previous old-school brokerages — and some things are more work than newer apps like RH. But they also provide a lot more. With Schwab you can get:

* Mutual funds
* IRAs
* 529s
* Joint accounts
* Checking accounts (with debit card)
* CDs
* Bonds (actual bonds, not funds)
* Access to IPOs
* Currency trading (Schwab Global)

etc.

Their research tools are also great. Much better than RH.Probably not.

You will miss all of the ease of access RH has built into the app. Their biggest asset is how much immediate info you can get just by viewing a stocks page.

That being said, Schwb has all that its just spread out over its website.I would say it depends on how tech savvy you are really. For someone like my dad it would be a struggle, Just getting him on Robinhood and showing him how to do stuff was about his limit for how much he could probably do on his own. 
If you think Robinhood is no struggle at all though then I’m sure Charles Schwab wouldn’t be too big of a learning curve. It’s mostly just getting used to the app after all.


But if you just did the CS chat with customer support they could help you with that stuff anyways.You make up much more than that on execution alone. You’re actually losing money with poor execution at places like Robinhood.If .65 cents per contract is expensive you are literally the exact type of person that shouldn’t be trading optionsYou pay commissions and they have customer service, actually fix bugs, way less outages, and their outages are much shorter. Commissions 100% pay for themselvesExcept if it's only the number of contracts that differs between two trades (all else being the same) it's going to be fractal so it eats into the cost basis at the same rate. Just different numbers.You clearly don’t understand the importance of quality execution. If you did, you would not be trading at RH.Hope you sold before you got taken outYea, pretty much just pay bills from it. Everything else like direct deposit I have discover bank in case I need to wire transfer. Haven’t ever had to contact customer service, I’m sure it is still terribleI started using TDA a few months ago and Customer service was super helpful with some questions I hadSchwab & Fidelity do not charge fees or commissions on trades.all of the discounts had to drop prices because of the free ones.  td ameritrade is free for non-assisted purchases and salesClassic snake oil salesman response. 'Caveat emptor' doesn't generally work very well against the SEC.That's true but still not morally right for them to capitalize on it. 

It's like sales men that sell snake oil, idk how they can go home and sleep at night in a bed paid from money you got taking advantage of people.

They aren't doing anything legally wrong but considering how many teenagers have commited suicide because of incorrectly trading options, the Robinhood execs should for sure feel guilty.Well for us changing to limit order is a matter of a couple of bucks while for buffet it is a matter of a couple of millionsSpoken like you’re jeff bezos lmaoInflation on 75k would be about 88k today in case anyone's curious.[More recent study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0277-0.epdf?sharing_token=ySyq_IWqF72iJPVX02gN7NRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0P6pRUGAIioLhu85ORBsjF_g5Rf0fuUViMASagr_M7VEy5MRXaYGPiRKa_FSO3qh3qFZW2eGnWNkmHVW7J5KJM5kHZ_dY8AULUrukyysIQ5PxXS7cUPJ28GwywaXRvjNOW4O4S4YopfDke1c2jLpKYweA_UiNmDU37muQ3AVIlWIl62D0tBToG48TSKGKsGp9KMPce9WhaRHaEaoEzqc98rna7AGO08mwDmHgtLsn_jqXU2G-YN2_zarpgTR7kDvizQyM192BGa7T2a7lLnBBvAlx8LVcBLiV3yZvBOGrOmOMpSj4vo8Co_lL7STsWDrCE%3D&tracking_referrer=www.usatoday.com) from Purdue/UVA had it at $105k in North America.That’s why he would rather have a billion to his name over $5.Don’t use RobinHood or Webull because if you ever have an issue their customer service is basically nonexistent. If you don’t want to lose money, use a real brokerage.Most “news” articles are really just ads. I use yahoo finance for other reasons but take their news section with a grain of salt.That's why I don't like it. I just want quick headlines and articles in reader mode with no distractions. I also like how RH doesn't bombard you with articles, I can get to the end, or find one from earlier in the day just by scrolling through the non-endless feed.Could you please elaborate, what exactly the risks?I use wellstrade since it's my bank and used before all these new ones popped up. E-Trade since 401k is there and webull. Webull by far has easiest platform to use and tons of info once you learn the platform. Option on wells is $6 webull free.It’s Chinese ownedThank you very much for your throughout response!Thank you for taking the time to answer  me.How? I thought robinhood didn’t have fees[deleted]Wtf are you guys saying? Acting all high and fucking mighty like you're so rich a 3% fee on an entire option is NOTHING. So everyone should be totally okay with losing hundreds of dollars when they do an XLE call that's 2 cents per contract. That's the reason to use RH.If you don't know the difference between 65 cents and .65 cents, you probably shouldn't trade options either.Also if it’s the same stock at the same premium, but different number of contracts their profits are amplified. So it doesn’t matter how many contracts because if you make $100 gains at $6.50 commission. Or $1000 gains at $65.00 commission its the same percentage.Yes and no.

Trading SPY? Execution doesn't matter as much on a .02 spread.

Trading a low volume/wide spread? VERY importantYep, its all realized gains from selling Telsa calls and puts over the last couple weeks.  I've been trying to stay more liquid in today's economic climate, and ride the ups and downs.You pay bills from it? You do realize capital gains will tax you out the ass end of the year, right. You might end up paying off bills, but increasing your taxes due at EoY without realizing it. If you know this and planned, you are ok, but most RH investors don’t realize this until after.True but Schwab doesn't offer fractional shares yet.My great grandfather was a snake oil salesman/con-artist selling sugar water as a cure all product. He was a terrible human being. He drank till he passed out to go to sleepThat happened once and it was terrible but still not RH's fault. They also said they would change the UI to make something like that less likely.Haha that’s a good one 👍Exactly. If I'm an unhappy billionaire, at least I can eat; I don't need to worry about not making rent, or car loans. The two lowest levels of Maslows hierarchy of needs are fulfilled.WeBull answers, but service is slow and I’ve gotten some rude agents before. Took 40 minutes to speak to someome onceI don’t, I only use Fidelity.Exactly when I first got into stocks I enjoyed the Yahoo  news but now I recognize it's all just bot articles and ads.If that is your focus, I also agree RH did exactly that.I think there times it was down during the initial covid dip and a lot of people on here lost a lot of moneyConsidering the amount of US debt it holds, the same could be said of America (probably other countries too, but I don’t know how much of their debt China owns)When you place an order between the bid and the ask, robinhood has a hard time filling it. In order to get quick fills you have to go closer to the ask (losing you money). Other brokers get way better fills, in fact for many of them they will get you a better price than you bidBut you lose so much more on execution. Quality execution is much more important than commissions.$0.65 is cheap when you factor in that on apps like Robinhood a bad fill could cost you at least a couple dollars per contract right off the bat. Every cent higher you get filled is a dollar added onto the whole contract, how is $0.65 a worse deal?If you’re buying 100 contracts .65 is literally nothing, once again, if .65 per contract is a problem, you should not be trading options.

I will gladly not use webull or RH and pay .65/contract to have an actual brokerage, not an app.Let me make sure I'm understanding this correctly. 100 contacts, meaning 10,000 shares? I feel like compared to 10,000 shares of almost anything, $65 will be negligible.No these guys love losing 3% of their contract instantly, let them do it and never do a play that involves hundreds of contracts. because you "shouldn't be doing that" ever!What in the fuck are you talking about.

1. I'm not being high and mighty clearly what I'm saying resonates with a lot of people
2. Why in the fuck are you acting like a 3% fee on a fucking option is a big deal when trading one of the MOST volatile and risky derivatives possible
3. The fact you can't see that it's a fucking good thing to incline people towards using real fucking brokers that can provide actual education and analysis to new traders so they don't wind up: (a) finding an infinite money glitch exposing them to literal infinite margin, (b) using an APP that has literally stopped working during trading days and caused people to lose thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars, or (c) using a fucking broker that SELLS your order flow.
4. No one should be buying 2 cent contracts unless you own the underlying stock and are using it as a hedge, if people are buying 2 cent contracts, you are most likely in many cases better off just buying the equity.
5. Options are fucking outrageously risky and using a BROKER not an APP is probably the right move because you can LITERALLY destroy your life and at least using a brokerage will give you better tools to avoid being pummeled into oblivion.

To each their own, but how people still fucking use that app blows my goddamn mind.Poor execution at RH, better execution at other brokerages. Execution is more important than commissions.god forbid I try to be as clear as possible when writing on the internet.It only takes $0.01 better execution to come out ahead by paying $0.65 commission.can confirm with zaetz20, they do offer fractional shares called Schwab slices. pretty awesome if you ask me.They do on companies in the s&p 500, unfortunately no other stocks.actually they doWhose fault is it? Their software, their glitches, their platform, their refusal to make whole sellers who lost because of their flaws. Who else could you possibly blame here?They say that and then barely changed the UI. 

RH didnt care about what happened but just didnt want negative PR. If they actually cared they would make  significant change. 

It's like when the suicide rate rose like 20% or something nuts after 13 reasons why was released and then they chose to make a season 2 and 3. 

Its corporate bullshit that cares more about sales than humans lives.I also got a rude agent before and ditched it.Webull is better than RobinHood but I don’t think it’s worth it to use the “budget brokers”Yeah WeBull was rude as fuck.I didn’t say you did. You said Webull seems to be an alternative and I was just saying that I would stay for any of those types of brokerages. I use TDA and Fidelity is great tooI've noticed this and I've asked them the times now how come you always over bid my buy order and under bid my sell order. Always thought it was a server issue. They blatantly don't respond to that email. They have responded to other questions though.This. .65 each way on a contract is totally worth it. I moved enough that Schwab knocked me down to .50Not to mention it literally crashes on days with high volume, had a literal infinite margin glitch, provides no in depth analysis, doesn’t provide educational tools, no scanners, and will crash and have people holding to exp and possibly losing loads of money.

Not a brokerage, it’s an appMarket orders < Limit orders... just sayingIf you're doing a credit spread for instance, you could be doing 100 contracts and only netting $500 credit. Taking $65 out of that hurts your risk:reward considerably[That was pretty insightful!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKjxFJfcrcA)So I highly recommend using Robin hood for a few options trades.

I use schwab for my retirement, but I have RH and I browse my selected stocks on RH, find which one im going to trade, check out the greeks on my exp, and then switch to schwab if the spread isn't tight.

Robinhood has outrageously good options trading tools at your finger tips compared to almost any other brokerage. No clicking on a link to a link just to see the chart. No having to google Iv. No havint to google the greeks.

To each their own tho.Depends on the volume and the spread.

.65 is not worth it trading SPY.But...you weren't clear at all. you were talking about contracts being .65 cents. However, they cost 65 cents.Yeah it was unfortunate not to be able to trade TSLA fractional but meh.I disagree, but whateverGotcha, noted.Yea, one of the ways robinhood makes money is buy selling your market data to high frequency trading firms. So if you want to buy Microsoft at 200, that buy order is sent to a firm where they will scan all the Microsoft offers, find one for say 199.9, then sell to you at 200 or 200.05 or something. And pocket the difference. Other brokers will just sell you the 199.9 - but you pay them commissions. That's a simple version of it anyways.Yeah, "real" platforms are way easier for looking at the option chain too. To see relevant information like the bid/ask, volume, the Greeks, etc its all right there in the chain, whereas on Robinhood you have to manually open each contract to see that information.Yes it isWas emphasizing the denomination and the value, I'm sure people knew what I meant. Sorry it confused you.So I'm new to this... what if the stock is trading higher than $10.38... do the people who own the stock lose money when Chevron buys it all out?It might be cheaper to just buy Chevron stockOf course I would have just bought Shell smhSo. If I have a call option out on NBL stock (long call) what happens to that after this deal goes through?Shit like this makes me believe in the energy sector long term. I know it has been hammered - even pre-Covid - but deals like this make me think something good is bound to happen.Who’s next? You know all the mid caps are going to get gobbled upHmmm so if I buy a bunch of noble energy right now, it's like buying Chevron at $75-80 a share. Is there like an X share transfer date or something. Otherwise, why not just buy noble when it's $10 or less, so you can basically buy Chevron at a discount?? I must be missing somethingInteresting, so my few noble shares should become a Chevron share, im all for it, Chevron being much more stable. We are going to see serious consolidations in the next few months in this industry.It’s already priced in.So NBL is on the rise today and is currently trading at $10.50+

If Chevron is only going to offer 10.38 a share, why would people trade for this stock at higher prices?No they receive stock. Chevron stock. For each noble 0.13 chevron stock.If Chevron offers 10.38 per share while the stock is trading higher than most likely shareholders will not accept the offer as why would you sell your shares to Chevron for 10.38 if you can sell in the market for more? On the flip side, if they offer a premium, ie. The share was trading at lets say 9 before they launched the offer, the share price will adjust to the offer price, so 10.38, immediatly when the offer is launched, as sell orders below that number will be filled and the shares bought will be sold to Chevron at 10.38.

Off market transactions are often different though, and can include either a control premium or bulk discount.

Edit: also, the adjustment to the offer price is dependent on the likelihood the offer is finalizedI’m new to this too and I don’t know the answer to your question. Trying to find it on investopedia. 

Seems Chevron would buy at 10.38 but they also will have to pay a premium. I don’t know if that premium is factored into the 10.38 target price. Hoping someone can chime in with a bit more experience.Good question. FollowingThey don’t lose money. They get .1191 shares of CVX. Which means you need to consider the price of CVX. Noble can trade higher than the dollar amount if CVX has a higher valuation.SameDepends on your strike price.

If you're ITM, sell it.

If you're OTM, you'll need to contact your broker to determine how it will be handled. This is standard CBOE treatment for most contractsFunnily enough it’s deals like this, which indicate further consolidation of the O&G industry, that makes me less certain about the energy sector moving forward - at least as it relates to oil production/refining/logistics/marketing. 

It just tells me there’s no organic growth out there in the form of CAPEX, and instead growth is coming from companies “bolting on” pre-existing assets through M&A in order to generate growth.makes me feel the opposite lolI wish XOM would do some similar stuffSomething good *is* bound to happen.

We will be using conventional fossil fuels for energy for decades to come. Renewables are promising and a shift to their use is inevitable but our current demands require conventional fossil fuels for the short and medium-term.

Tons of great operators, operating responsibly, making good profits for shareholders and paying good wages and benefits to employees.Long-term half of these supermajors are dead men walking. Those that don't adapt to a low carbon world will simply cease to exist.APAPretty sure each share of Noble you will get a fractional share of Chevron.Good question, how does this work when Chevron acquires NBL?yes the premium is factored in that 10.38 but receiving the stock equivalent of chev stockThere's three ways to this kind of transaction: cash, stock, or a combination. Cash is pretty straightforward. In that case, the announcement would have been something like: "Chevron offers to purchase NBL for $10.38 per share to all shareholders of record on Aug. 27, 2020." Something like that. It'll have the price listed and a record date, which you would need to have purchased the stock by. Usually, you'll see the stock pop shortly after the announcement to close to the offer price. It'll usually be lower by the amount of daily interest accrued through closing (usually only a few cents), but sometimes, you can see it pop higher where shareholders expect a higher offer to come in. Shareholders then get cold, hard cash when the acquisition takes place.

A stock deal, like this one, can be different. Here, they're tying it to a certain price, so it will act like a cash deal, except instead of getting cash, you'll get Chevron stock. If Chevron's stock goes up before the record date, you'll get fewer shares; if it goes down, you'll get more, so that the next is $10.38 per share. 

Another way to do it (which is not taking place here) would be if Chevron offered 0.12 shares per share of NBL. In that case, NBL would start trading around the price of a share of Chevron \* 0.12, and it would fluctuate pretty much in lockstep with Chevron.No public company is going to selling for less than market value in an on market transactionGood to know, thanksI didn't think of it that way. I'm thinking more in the lens of investing in a company: If I had a diverse energy portfolio (ha ha) this might be a meh move, but if I was heavily into Chevron I might be happy. It means the company is acquiring other businesses and will have a great share of the market.I agree with this. I think this is indicative of significant headwinds, and the fact that it is a stock deal, rather than a cash deal, means that Chevron might be expecting further declines.There is organic growth out there for oil production, but the problem is that it's tied to long term projects. Options for oil majors are basically either a) long-running offshore production or huge scale infrastructure development in undeveloped countries a la tengizchevroil or b) buying up acreage in shale plays that are very flexible in terms of production timing (can be ramped up/down quickly).

Option B is much more flexible in the long term, but the issue is that basically all the acreage is already owned/leased. So the only way to get more production in that type of asset is to buy another company or another companys assets. Option A you can go negotiate with Guyana or whoever it is to acquire the rights, but you have to invest a ton more into it.Buying out other companies assets can allow a large energy company like Chevron the ability to better optimize those assets given their own current assets. You can better trade around things and generate good value from newly acquired assets whether you used “capex” to build the asset yourself or acquired it through M&A. Getting new storage/refining assets can greatly increase the value of potentially old unproductive assets.Good point and worth thinking about but I'd say that can mean more "reasonable "supply increases as opposed to the boom period in/around 2008 that led to absurd VC influx and the "drill baby drill" mentality that pushed the industry to an eventual price crash.  Also the bolting on of more infrastructure can  also lead to CAPEX reductions, or adding said production to existing infrastructure can create some cost savings in transportation/processing. 

Tech/geo gets better but that progress seems to have slowed somewhat, so fair point on hitting some of those limits in CAPEX reduction from operational efficiencies. 

Also there are other formations to tap but lots of them aren't feasible bc of pricing at the moment. Marketing though definitely is the long game issue if renewables/battery systems can squeeze out electricity production in the future.> It just tells me there’s no organic growth out there in the form of CAPEX

It's not about organic *growth* now. Shareholders don't want growth. They want operators to be cashflow positive and to have flexibility in an uncertain world.

Tons of innovation going on in drilling and completions. Simul-frac is much more energy efficient and less time-consuming, which leads to lower expenses for the same production in a shorter timeframe. Dual-fuel fracs are also very promising and would be great for environmentalism.

Lots of IoT going on to help monitor production and its externalities much more efficiently as wellI'm also confident that some if these large energy companies will shift to match any regulation or competition.Thank you for the information! Much appreciated.That’s fair, good for Chevron and it’s investors no doubt, but not a good indicator for the broader sector long term.They absolutely will and you hit on probably the most important detail regarding these companies.

They are **energy** companies. They aren't just oil and gas companies. When another energy source is the best option, they'll pivot to that. Right now the best option is oil and gas.

Frequently left out of conversations so I'm glad you mentioned it.So what if I buy it now at 10.18?I guess. I doubt Chevron decided to purchase the company thinking the market won't rebound.Shit, even Shell has some investments and RnD in solar.Most supermajors do. Some mid-majors have teams that keep abreast of that sector, among other things.

Energy companies are going to be good investments for a very, very long time.Agreed. I don't think we'll see the numbers we did 2-3 years ago, but pre-Covid numbers should be there. Sounds like Oxford Uni has a vaccine that might work, which only bodes well for the O+G sector imo.I find that losing money is really helpful with this issue. When I am gaining I want to look all the time, but if things suck and there are no actions I plan to take I may ignore it for weeks. Also, I find being in the wilderness without internet for weeks can also help.When you’re dealing with numbers you need to stay relaxed. How many times a day do you jerk off? Me, twice a day. Once at market open and once more before market close.Figure out your intention with your stocks. Do you want to be an Investor with your Tesla stock, or a Trader with your Tesla stock? Two different jobs, two different attitudes.   

If you want to be a Trader, then yes, you need to check it regularly.  In fact, you'll need a real-time trading station, subscriptions to data feeds like Bloomberg and Reuters, all to get those latest swings, most current advantages, and to be ahead of the thousands of traders worldwide. Yeah, I thought not.  

On the other hand, if you want to be an Investor...take a breath. Research your company, know its value, figure out what it's worth and where you expect it to get to based on fundamentalls, then leave it alone and wait. Check in every quarter to see if its sticking to the goals. Your timeline should be in the years, not hours. It really doesn't matter what Tesla does tomorrow. What it does long term matters.  

Trust me, I've been down this exact road, and with Tesla. I first bought in at I think $29!!! It was swinging around huge amounts back then. I sold a bunch when it hit $100, thinking I was made. Now I look back at those days of sweating and wish I had just bought in and not looked at it until I was ready to buy a house or whatever. The daily swings today make my initial purchase look like blips on the graph. I wasted nervous energy on it. I didn't think like an Investor. I thought like a gambler. Now I know way more.No way out, this is your life nowMove to New Zealand. The market is only open from 1:30 to 8:00 am. No need the check your portfolio multiple times a day because it won’t be changing.

Your sleep schedule will get fucked up though!I installed tinder, now I am obsess about matchesI have the same issue! To be fair, I’m bored as hell in this quarantine and have nothing else to do..This comes with time. You'll find yourself checking less and less as time goes on. After a few years you'll probably only check once a week. 

Assuming you're a new investor, this is fun for you, this is exciting so you want to check all the time but as time goes on you will stop checking.I love it. This is basically all my days but the weekend.. Can't think of anything elseDay trade, Don’t holdI set up timer to look somewhere else every 1hour 😂You're anxious about uncertainty. If you've done your DD and are confident about your investment, you'll have much easier time walking away from it. If you're just hopping on a hype train, or you're just yolo'ing because stonks only go up, you're gonna be constantly checking to see if you made the right decision.Sort out noice from information.

In the late 1990s, internet boom came along. Many people even quit their day time job addicted to stock investment. AOL, fiberoptics, chip, search engines, virtual reality or invest in forerunner of Amazon, online shopping, online books, fashions. It was lucrative. Most could make $1K day trade in stocks with a dial up connection.  Then the dot com collapse. It was common day traders lose 400K or life savings in a matter of days. Many went get a real day time job to have a life.  These dot coms have elements of today's flag ship companies which is second generation with better technology. Many did not turn in a profit continue doing so.It’s nice to check just to see what’s going on when I’m bored. Also it makes me feel good I’m investing for my future.By closing your eyes.Start buying comic booksSet sell limit every morning, get off and enjoy natureI check my portfolio couple times a day (easy phone access) and I don't see the issue with it. Only if checking your portfolio forces you to some action, then its an issue, personally I just watch it for the over all status of the market. And if some large moves happen I just wonder what happened and go look for news. Did not sell during spring with -20% down, so I believe I will manage myself properly.let ur cat change your paswordSounds like you may be taking on too much investment risk if you’re checking so often and it’s driving you madI don't.

At Close

Then again, I'm not staring at it, mostly just taking a quick glance to see if I need to sell some stock or buy an option.Honestly there’s nothing wrong at all with checking your portfolio a few times a day, it’s interesting. What really matters is being non-emotional and not stressing out over the movements. Once you master that, it’s easygoingI have my retirement in an online Schwab account. That one I check once a day, maybe. My Robinhood? It’s like crack.I check my portfolio 100 times a day lol , I just like seeing green 💰💰Sell everything, sleep like a babyBecome a full time trader and have one long session looking at your portfolio.You have to set up a System which you trust to work without your Intervention for atleast a week. 

For me: I only invest via my home PC, never via mobile. I have clear (long term) goals for buying and selling (Price reached, Company Outlook changes). I set stop-loss/sell Orders for the coinflips. When I check one specific position (for you probably tesla) to often I reduce it because that means I am not comfortable with that exposure. 

With that I am comfortable to let the portfolio sit for a week or two. The next step is to delete all related Apps from mobile and do a 5 day No Stockmarket Challenge. Within that you will see that nothing is really that interesting. It goes up 2 it goes down 5 it goes up 4.. It doesn't matter if your plan is clear. After that you may be able to develop a healthy relationship to investing as a hobby.

So i only get to look at the opening, go to sleep, and wake up, then proceed to WSB for my daily lawls. 

However, i still look at my portfolio like multiple times a day just to fantasize about what new positions i want to get, or how to increase my current positions.I used to look all the time.

All you needI know that I've made stable long term investments and that I'm not going to be seeing any significant net gain for several years. So why stress about it on a daily basis. I'll check my portfolio maybe twice a week, more if there's news pertinent to my interests. But I'm no longer frantic about it, because I stopped perceiving it as gambling.I like looking at my portfolio, I don’t mind seeing everything red, I’m still confident with my investments. However just try and do sometime to occupy your mind, some random hobbyWhat ap do you use?

I find that I check my Robinhood 10× more than my Fidelity IRA.

Ive been thinking about this too. Notifications can tempt me to pull up the ap, I should disable them. 

You could remove the aps from your phone and just check on your computer?

I also am taking a break from individual stocks (for the most part) and day trading, and I feel soooo much more apathy about my portfolios. That helped me a ton.It’s only moneyGive it like 5 yearsAfter a year or two you get numb unless you do options.No magic pill here. Just stop looking at it. When the market gets volatile, you should be checking a lot, but we're pretty steady now, so lay off. It's just self control -- an exercise and habit you built as with anything.Do you look up your home value everyday?Change your outlook. Focus on the long term vision, not in the short term. Money can be made in the short term but growth is had in the long term. If you see your stock picks aligning with your vision of the future (sounds like it is if you bought Tesla) then rest easy by knowing that you have some good insight into what the future is going to look like. Tell yourself that stock xyz will be worth wayyy more in the future and don’t worry about short term losses or gains.Simple, buy quality stocks in companies you trustThis is my trick: I don’t check my stock prices within my stock trading app. I manually enter all my stocks into the stock app on my iPhone. This way, I can check stock prices without actually seeing how much money I’ve gained or lost. It’s a mental trick that helps me stay sane.
I’ll only check my actual portfolio gains and losses about once a week or less.Just get blazed and cook some food dawg.

No more alerts. No more addicting UI. 7 step process to do or view anything. Performance only on a month-to-month basis.

Some people will probably say "but you can't do X!" or "it's so much work to do Y!" and like... yeah that's the point.Thanks for reminding me to go check my portfolio!You could just get broad indexes with a plan to stay invested for many years and chill.

I mostly just check in once a month for rebalancing. I have a strategy that I stick to, and knowing how my positions are doing won’t change thatIf you do, you're investing too much of your income/savings.Only invest in things you know you’re going to hold for like at least 10 years. That way the day to day price doesn’t matter whatsoeverTurn off alerts. 

I don't have alerts, I just check my stocks twice a day. If you're in it for the long haul you don't need alerts. Sometimes I come to this subreddit, sometimes I don't.

I also have other things to distract me like work, making lunch/dinner, games, tv whatever elseYou have a scarcity mindset when it comes to money.the solution probably vary quite a bit from person to person. best advice i can give is every time you logon ask yourself what you even intend to do. if it was up or down 10% would you do anything at all? if not there really is no point in looking they are just numbers that constantly change. of course if you really do have some intention of taking a certain action perhaps the real answer is to set appropriate alerts and only check when those go off.

&#x200B;

in short be more mindful of why you are even looking at the portfolio and every time you logon to basically do nothing note it. it won't instantly make things better but it will take you a few steps in the right direction if you keep it up.You’re learning.

Hide the app you invest with.Delete the appsI found that looking at my portfolio was almost always detrimental to my portfolio. For example, before the market crashed in February/March, I only checked my portfolio maybe once a week, because I knew there was nothing I needed to do with it (all in safe equities), i.e. no reason to check it. Once stocks started to dip, I felt like there wasn’t going to be an end to it, so like an idiot i pulled out my money close to the bottom to try and make some plays with it via leveraged inverse ETFs. Initially, I made a lot of money back, but then got greedy and sunk myself into a deeper hole than I was before. Also, because i had pulled out, I felt compelled to try and time a market bottom, as I stood on the sidelines and watched the market skyrocket.

I eventually bought back in partially, but was also checking the market constantly. This led me to try and make options plays, which in the hands of someone as completely inexperienced as I am is just gambling. Made money, then got burned harder.

These two events taught me a valuable lesson: the best bet for making consistent money over time is to put your money into equity and completely forget about it. I did this last week and uninstalled the mobile app for my broker entirely. Now I rarely check it at all, which is significantly better for both my mental health and my money.

TL;DR: invest all of your money into equity you don’t need to check more than once a month and delete the app.Keep a journal of your feelings/emotions every day about your portfolio. Then make a spreadsheet that has the months of the year in each column. On the first day of the month update the spreadsheet with starting portfolio value, additional money you put in, ending portfolio value, and increase/decrease in value (I do ending value - additional money - starting value). This gives you a snapshot of your overall dollar value increase/decrease for each month of the year. Then go back and read through your journal. You will quickly see how your feelings/emotions don’t correlate to the overall results. This quickly helped me realize that my feelings aren’t facts when it comes to investing and I’m better off just sticking to investing fundamentals and looking at the big picture. Using this method I was able to avoid the recent hysteria and my portfolio is way up over the past 6 months.By crying in between each time. The longer I cry the less I look at it.It’s pretty easy, just lock your phone with a random passwordI occupy my mind with something more fun like playing MMO's.Lol.

It also helps when most of your money is in retirement accounts and you can't touch it for another 30 years.set it and forget it; all you need is a global tracker and thank me in 20 yearsPut your money into an index fund and stop pretending like you’re smart enough to beat the marketI make a point to check once when I wake up, movements more than 10% in either direction and right before close, every day. The consistency helps with my expectations, not of gains/losses but of brain prep for diving in and out of the thought process. 

Then, most importantly, I focus much more on my career gains and life gains. Money I invest feels almost 100% like a video game. It takes the pressure off on caring about movements a lot and honestly helps me trade better. But, I'm also a young single guy without much obligation. If I had a family and other people to feed I think I would just dump into $SPY and $TQQQ if I'm bullish or just $SPY if I'm uncertain.If you're that worried about your investment choices, you may want to revisit how you came to the decisions you made. Second guessing yourself will cause all kinds of stress.Buy mutual funds. they only provide NAV at the close.Having a strategy lolOP, when do you plan on selling?  Is this for retirement and you plan on holding for a year+ or even decade plus?

If you're checking the market regularly you're trading not investing, which is okay if that is what you want to be doing.I think a solid plan and time helps. I’ve only been an investor for 4 years now but I still find myself at least once or twice a day. Usually once during the day and once after the market close.

It’s just cuz I like seeing what the market is doing as well as planning my next buy.

At first it seemed to drive me crazy on the down days where you feel like you should do something but the best course of action is 99% of the time inaction. Time has helped with that where I know I can check most days as i won’t make a rash decision.Set rules for yourself.  "I will only look at market open and market close."  My rules are 1)  Only buy and sell on Tuesday and Friday.  2)  Never trade from my phone.Don’t go cwypto. It’s 24/7/365Look at it once after close.  Take the app off your phone, so it’s harder to check.If you have a long term goal than just remind yourself of that. What happens every minute of every day doesn't really matter.

If you're day trading then you probably should be checking constantly.I found some stonks I haven’t touched in 6 years some of the stocks have done good some not so good.. - wouldn’t recommend this window honestly it was just a 5k and forget.. but I Had a ftse tracker (again should have followed) some junk bonds.. and some div stocks.. I got like1k in divi money to play with ! - it’s a bonus I forgot I had them at all... (yes reinvesting ect) the ftse teacker is still up unbelievably even inflation adjusted.. 
If you want to buy stocks just leave them, if you want to trade check twice a day..It sounds like either you are relatively new to buying stocks or speculating.  Probably reading a good book or a few books would help.  The market will always swing up and down, but if you are in it for the long haul  ten years at least, you'll have better results.  Plus buy companies you've done a little homework on.When that bullshit ENPH article happened a month ago I panic sold at basically the bottom. It recovered the very next day and has continued to rise. I shoulda just bought back in immediately but didn't.

I stopped checking it now.I just realize that it doesn't matter and that I have no control over it because the market is jerking itself off.I have a jobStart reading financial statements, it will be a better use of your time.

If your portfolio produces that much anxiety, then your portfolio contains too much risk. It's really as simple as that. 

I can attest, and say that when I was younger (with much less invested), the twists and turns of the market would give me endless anxiety. But having aged, having accepted that once my money is invested, the day to day movements are largely out of my control, and being convinced that whatever happens in the short term is outweighed by potential future gains - i can say that today, with quite a bit more invested than I did back then, I don't loose sleep because of investments.Read about and apply fundamental analysis. One of its perks is that you end up teaching yourself on how to keep away from your broker account all the time ;)Invest versus trade. If you invest, you should set and forget. Periodically “gut check” your investments if there is something that has changed your outlook or appetite.Only Day traders & swing traders look at their screens multiple times a day. A long term investor or even trader buys & doesn’t need to look at the screen because when you look at a stock like AMZN or TSLA ( momentum) move, it can go up or down $100 quids in 20 minutes . You don’t want to be emotional when trading because it’s easy to get out of your positions but stocks often hit resistance and move back up. Then you chase the stock thinking you can get back in but this rarely works out.

The markets are pretty crazy at the moment, which is why I think people are on edge.I put two factor on my E*TRADE and it’s such a fucking pain in the ass to log in on mobile now that I just do not care. 

I’m not a day trader, I won’t sell anything under a year from when I get in something so really who cares.   All my stock money is gambling, the ETF’s are retirement and I don’t have any reason to check up on them daily.  

It’s nice to know where you stand with things so I’ve got apple’s stock widget set up to show my 10 or so things that are close to decision making territory.   Once I’ve decided to dump a stock I set a limit order and let the market have it.   Pretty simple, no hasty decisions.  

If you’re a recreational investor or gambler honestly you just need to learn, assume your money is flushed away and be patient.  If you’re a day trader then the fluctuation on a given day may be material but honestly otherwise you should do research and set targets for your single stock picks which more often than not won’t make you as much money as if you let a professional manage an ETF for you.What is it with the flood of dumb questions hereInstead of looking at the portfolio, I read up on finance and stay up to date with world events instead so instead of JUST looking at the portfolio I also look at things that'll affect my portfolio.The majority of the world are checking Facebook etc to see how many likes they got - at least you're checking on something that will hopefully free you some day to live as you please.I did not touch the app in March and only more frequently in April. Now I am back and check 5 times a day min.As a young investor I kind of did the opposite. If I didn't keep looking in February and March, I would have missed on tons of DCA opportunities.Best answer ever: get off the grid. There's no hope. Really.Haha same hereRed numbers for days in a row really takes the incentive out of checkingSo buy options. ThanksNah you gotta pump those numbers up, those are rookie numbers.That post-nut clarity for the wisest decision making.I cry twice a dayAfter this scene, I now jerk off with a bank note as both arousal materials and tissue paper.The true pump and dumpbest comment ever! 

but its a fact, you have toRookie numbers, indeed.you stole that from the wolf of wall streetThis times a 100.

If you want to invest, find companies you believe in, buy, and most importantly "set it and forget it." Yeah, that's boring and I know it.Experience of being in the market teaches a lot more then any book will. Every investor has different intentions with there investment.
If you’re long term on your stocks, take my advice and just look few times a week.Reading _A Random Walk Down Wall Street_ at the mo and it recommends a portfolio of 30+ stocks to diversify some of the mitigable risk. With such a hands off approach do you still invest the bulk in individual stocks or have you broadened into passive index funds?I just put invested 50% of my net worth into an ETF for long term investment. It dipped ever so slightly today and it's making me crazy already. Teach me the ways of long-term investing sanity senseiMakes me feel like Smaug counting and memorizing his gold coinsAgreed, such is life.One of usI invested in tinder, doubled my money. Still dont have a gfBrilliant.you can use apps like stockmarketeye to keep track of whatever holdings you want to track.Yeah, they have a web app now.  It's pretty nice actually.I only use my laptop with RH actually, don't really like the appAgree with everything, but tech is not a bubble. Tech is and always will be the futureGood advice.

I just want to add clarity, that if you are actively day trading, it’s best that you do not look away. If you are not 100% focused on what is happening, you are not day trading.Man, I took time off work in March and was on it constantly. Just tried to get money into as many cheap stocks as I could.see I touched the app to buy things like apple, but tried not to look at what the overall account was doingAnd they say the perfect comment doesn't exist.Rookie numbersYou broke the 4th wall, now your karma shall suffer.Yep. The hardest thing for an investor to do is nothing at all. It can be nauseating watching your money go through swings daily. "My portfolio opened +$15 from where it was yesterday, and finished -$15. If only I sold at open. Or, even better, if I sold when it was +$21." Zero commission is a blessing and a curse, but you need to make it work as a blessing.Or only look when you deposit money to invest. And while you do have it right about experience>intelligence, there is a lot you can learn from other people's mistakes.That's a very well-respected book and has excellent concepts. However, if you're going to invest in 30+ stocks, that's a lot of companies to be an expert on and to know them well. I don't  think many people are experts on 30+ companies  or industries.  If you want to "reduce risk", well firstly that really says you're not too confident in the long-term prospects of the companies you're invested in, and secondly, you're way better off just buying an ETF or Index Fund that follows the market - that's the ultimate diversification.  Even Buffett gives people that exact advice.  

However, if you're investing with long-term timelines, get to intimately know a smaller group of companies to such an extent that you're completely confident they will be  around and dominating their industry sectors long term. That way you can sleep at night and not be checking the share price every second because another company has appeared overnight to rival yours. Good examples of companies with amazing moats are sometimes very boring, but long-term they're incredible wealth generators. Just look at where Buffett has the vast majority of his investments -  mostly in just half a dozen companies that just dominate their sectors. 

So, in summary, the safest route for most people that don't have the time to thoroughly do the research: buy an ETF or Index Fund. If you are highly knowledgeable (or willing to become so), pick a few (I'd say 10-20 or so, depending on your free time) companies,  particularly in fields you're an expert or passionate about, and invest in not the coolest or hottest companies,  but the ones you're sure have a durable competitive advantage that they can keep going long term.Buy several uncorrelated assets. A 33/33/33 mix of QQQ/TLT/GLD kept me from going crazy during the March and April volatility. It greatly smoothed out the dips and even though I would've made more if I just went 100% stocks, it's helped me sleep better at night.Yesssss. Feed the ego of biasKeep doubling your money then, it will happen 😁Trust me you're better off without oneYou can either have money or a gf, can't have bothStill panic sold today 🤔😂Cheap stocks... Why cheap stocks? Are a pump and dump monkey?

Wanted to bet on nio before q1 earnings, bought some share with legerage on plus 500, since I had no commission, the day after the earnings (topped estimates 30%) Nio was down, so since had no commission immediately sold. Bought at 4 sold at like 3.80. If only I padi commissions I would have been +200 ROI rnI don't have either of em =(You need $$$ to afford a gfNot cheap in the share price sense, just good stocks that dropped by like 30-40%Have you just not realized this subreddit is literally called "stocks"?Welcome to Reddit where everything is an inside joke that everybody understands.You can have a hug from me GOh k gotcha. What were your top picks? I think I made like 150% in Royal Caribbean and had some TQQQ calls that printed up real nice.....what?Dawww +1I just scooped up big tech stocks like msft, goog, amzn nothing that blew up. My big one has been TSLA and NVDA but I've been sitting on those for a few years now. Got some slv when it dipped super hard and had a good day today with that.And I thought it was too expensive at 300 😭I am holding my remaining 70 shares waiting for today.  Will sell 35 at 1750 and hold the rest for 2000 (battery day).daddy Elon....I’m a big hater of Tesla stock but I’m impressed right now.God damn it...I’ve missed the train to work!!Holy fcking shiaaat tsla is making me hypeDo not sell!So since it is eligible for s&p with 4 straight quarters profit, any idea when that is happening? Few days or months??I been holding since $500Buying $100 of TSLA a day keeps the doctor away.In for 10 at open tomorrow.So who over here is shorting lolTime to join the s&p!🚀 🚀 🚀Honestly I have no idea what I'm doing with Tesla. I mean, I dont know when to sell so I've been holding tesla since 600...

Tesla was also my first, and probably best other than NIO, stock i boughtI like tesla but that stock price is insane. I wouldn't touch even it if it fell to half of the value it's at. When it fell to the 300s I still thought it would go down to $250 where I though about getting into it but I guess not.Bloody Reddit kept on saying Tesla is over valued should have done more homework into them.... this sub has too many Tesla hatersTSLA to 4,2069Cooked books to get included in the s&p.
Welcome to modern investingI yolo’d all my money and bought 6 shares when it was at $1600 like 30 mins ago. Never bet against ElonBought some a few days ago and don’t regret it at all.They fking did itTheir P/E ratio is 3300🥶🥶Don’t be fooled. Tesla lost money on making cars and they only made a profit from selling regulatory credits to other car manufacturers. In fact they would have lost hundreds of millions without these credit sales which are nearly 100% profit. Be careful... past due for a sell off.Tesla is the next Trillion dollar company. Maybe Facebook or Alibaba gets there before them, but still.Just wait till the 5:30 callI have none, never had none.😂🤣😂🤣😂So where are they now? $2kTesla hitting $2k tomorrow lolTesla just keeps BTFOing naysayers quarter after quarter lolGreat result if true. But why is there 1.485B in accounts receivable? Looks like fraud to me. The numbers are to good to be true.  Especially generating a profit as a car manufacturer during a pandemic.Don’t let the bubble pop on yaThey received $428 million in regulatory credits and posted a profit. Yay for creative accounting and all the taxpayers that didn't know they own part of a tesla somewhere.Congrats and welcome aboard! What are your growth expectations and what made you purchase at this price?How many shares did u buyBought in last week and I’m not touching it until 2025

Then I’ll buy my first Tesla!I bought at 360 and sold at 800 and thought i was the smartest dude on earth...this really humbled meHave you considered the booked regulatory credits (2/3 of the 2020 regulatory credits) per Q2?312ish sold for 800ish happy but wish I had held onTesla is a good company and it has high potential. Watch this! [Should you buy Tesla stocks?](https://youtu.be/FAliEZs0VaI)Where did TSLA post their earnings? Link please!I’m holding out.  I like Elon.

Only a crazy person would hold this long. Bravo though.Still over valued! It will come bursting like an over blown balloon. Just be patient and have cash on hand to pull the trigger on some shares.I remember thinking I screwed up when I bought at $256 only for it to tank after earnings a year ago.I new it would be great! By the way you should join our options trading sub we made it today https://www.reddit.com/r/OptionsExclusive/I wanted to buy it at 180 some years ago but didn't so it because it was volatile as fuck.

I know it's kind've a meme stock at this point and can't keep this up forever, and Elon is... Eccentric, but what's your point of view on the poor view?Run fast and catch up and hop onNot selling manWhy notSeptember 21st is the Q3 meeting when the S&P normally rebalances the index.It fits the requirements but that doesn’t guarantees anything, it has to be added by the commission and if/when they add it, AFAIK it’s gonna be without warning.

They may add it tomorrow, next month, next year or never.Unfortunately, I am.When?When?I’m right there with Tesla was my first, avg is $424 been holding since cause i don’t know when to sell. Let’s go to Mars 🚀Are you expecting the stock price to go up in step with every time their earnings increase.

I seriously don’t understand the logic, say the company Revenue and profits grows by 30% a year. Would you expect the market to just sit and wait for it to hit that 30% increase and then just jump up the day it achieves It?

The stock price is only reflecting the continuous and reliable growth in the company. Its not the same maths as for a company that grows a couple of percent a year.I feel like market cap is what people should talk about.  Stock price is manipulatable by issuing or reverse splitting.  With a market cap of less then $300 billion when they will probably become a one or two trillion dollar company,  it's looking pretty cheap here.  It's not a risky stock like it was when it was 3 years ago.At $1600 Tesla's PE ratio ([TTM GAAP EPS](https://ir.tesla.com/static-files/f41f4254-f1cc-4929-a0b6-6623b00475a6)) is like 830. [Amazon's](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/pettm/AMZN/PE-Ratiottm/Amazon.com-Inc) has been swinging between 45 and 3732 in the past 13 years, currently sitting at around 150. [Apple](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/pettm/AAPL/PE-Ratiottm/Apple) has been between a much more modest 9 to 32, currently sitting around maximum. I believe in value investing, but I also admit that a good story can beat ratios. And it seems that Tesla is a story company, evident in the way it swings on good or negative news. It's the 

But overall, [current market's Schiller PE](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) is about twice (30) the historical average (16). Lower than the before the 2000 plunge (46), but higher than before the 2008 crash (27).This sub basically represents Mr. Market Man from The Intelligent Investor.

TSLA stock was hated by virtually everyone in this sub who wasn't clearly a die-hard TSLA fanboy back when it was in the $200's. A lot of posts talking about why it was a good investment were downvoted.

Then TSLA starts to take off like a rocket, and people in this sub start to FOMO into TSLA at $400, $500, $600, $700, $800, $900, etc. 

Yet literally nothing changed about the stock. If you did your research you knew the China Gigafactory was going to start pumping up the numbers and boosting TSLA's earnings. You'd have known the Model Y would be very successful just like the Model 3.

Bottom line: Don't blindly follow the market sentiment about stocks. Do your own research. Sometimes Mr. Market Man is very wrong and eventually sees the error of his ways.if you knew anything about reddit tesla and elon have been hated on reddit for many years since those kids in asia were stuck in that caveYeah, daily threads "Tesla is detached from reality" are hilarious.I would say the mix is consistent with the world at large. I never understood how a company that has made it their mission to scale the tech the world needs to combat climate change could draw so much hate.That's not a numberaint that the fucking truth.Wall Street bets gang yeahSell the newsYou son of a bitch, I'm in.Salesforce has had quarters within the last five years, where P/E ratio over trailing four quarters has been over 10,000. Even now, its trailing P/E is well over a hundred.

I don't see many posts about Salesforce here. In fact, most people think of Salesforce as a beast of a stock.How are you coming up with that? Are you just using last quarters EPS? You need to use annual EPS. The last 4 quarters. Im getting about 900. 143m + 105m + 16m + 104m = 368m/200m shares outstanding is 1.84 EPS into a share price of about 1660 right now. 1660/1.84=902Diamond handsDon’t be fooled they only made money selling cars. In fact they would have lost hundreds of millions not selling cars. We all know car sales can disappear any day.

Anything else we should say they wouldn’t make a profit if they didn’t sell.Google, Facebook, Alibaba and Tencent will all get there before Tesla.

There's a chance Tesla will get there before Berkshire, Visa and J&J.

Walmart may beat them to a trillion if they can capitalize on their e-commerce strategy. JP Morgan has a shot as well.He’s dorky yet dynamic. The price will blow up after the call.Do you think it's not going to be so good?Doubt it....top will be 1800, but realistically it’ll drop by the end of the day and Friday.Not sure how they calculate it, but they have been showing receivables in about the [same ratio to revenue (18%)](https://stockdividendscreener.com/auto-manufacturers/tesla-trade-receivable-comparison-with-peers) each quarter for the last 21 quarters. It does look odd to have more than 1.5 bln worth of cars sold but not paid for. So maybe it's just slow banking? It is an issue to be investigated, indeed.They actually delivered real cars during this pandemic, you can check deliveries against country registrations.

Accounts receivable is usually proportional to Europe sales. The finance companies in Europe take like 20days to pay up. Check their books if you don’t believe me.Could logically be two things: 1. They have delivered cars to customers at the ending of the quarter and havent received/accounted the payment for it or the more shady 2. They account the upcoming pre orders as sales. That last point is no problem in stable economic times but could be, if true, an achilles heel if the economic downturn really kicks in and prospective customers cant affort their pre order anymore. At this point we really cant say, the numbers are not audited. The Q looks very good apart from some if not red then orange flags, if they can hold this up for the year i will be very impressed.Lol right... It was a 100% certainty they were posting a profit even if it was 1 cent. People don't realize how easy it is to have creative accounting to make things look awesome. 

Underneath tho sales and deliveries were down YOY. Obviously there's reasons for that. I wouldn't be worried if I was long. But the quarter wasn't impressive at all. But nor should it be! Cars are shit during recessions and it speaks to the business model they weren't down more YOY in the environment. 

But anyways... that's why it didn't moonshot into the stratosphere like people thought it would.Technically it’s people buying polluting cars in Europe that pay for it.Shows they are light years ahead of the competition.I think it will keep increasing until the next brick/tweet/whatever that makes it dip, at which point I'll likely buy more. The normal dealership model just doesn't make sense anymore, I dislike Elon but clearly he is doing something right.https://ir.tesla.com/static-files/f41f4254-f1cc-4929-a0b6-6623b00475a6Google it Jesus🤣🤦‍♂️I bought at 270 and sold at 188.

EDIT: I did not plan for this to be my most upvoted comment, I hate you all.Same here. At least we made money. Mine was actually 355 to 550, but still.Bought at 250, and holding to 10,000 😎That's still good. How could anyone have seen this growth coming, and hindsight is always 20/20.Same.  Bought at 240 sold at 720.  Felt like a genius then and an idiot now.  Just bought back in this morning.Bought for $210 sold at $420 checking in 

Honestly I’m not even sad about that, I’m sad I didn’t buy back in March when it went back down to $400That is great, 100% profits my guy. Gotta look at the facts and not the what could have beens. That’s how you stay a happy investor!Dog, any profit is a win.  Hindsight 20 20.That was good. Having tesla shares is walking on thin ice. U dont have any aidea what could happen cuz tesla shares are rly overvalued.That was good...Profit is profit.Crazy person here. Been holding since $125. First bought at $75. Sold for a profit and bought back at $125. All these ups and downs are fun but long term I like this company.Not really as crazy as you think.

It's all about identifying generational talent. Basketball players like Lebron come along once a generation. Visionary leaders like Bezos come along once a generation. Pick them out and hitch your horses to the right wagon.

There are people who believe in Tesla the company and have been buying every month up or down since 2013.

Believe it or not, there are also people who have been buying Amazon whether up or down for the past 20 years.People been saying this since they were $200!

While I agree I’m not sure what crashes this in an irrational market and most likely it’ll be precipitated by a black swan causing a much wider crash.  IMO at least.

Personally I’ve been selling on the way up, a couple at $700 couple at $1000, couple at $1500.
I’ve covered my original investment plus some so holding onto the rest (with a basis of $350).Because there's a bigger chance that it's going to drop down to 1600 before going back up to 2000 on battery day.  They'll load back up when it drops to 1600.I will wait after battery day for it to hit 2500. I will be selling a few at 2000 and ride the others for 2500. I think by early next year we should be near 2500I think it’s more about Elon then anything, he’s been in pop culture for years... who even is the ceo of Ford? 

Tesla has less the 1% market share of cars in the world this shit is nuts. But I’ve been wrong every day so clearly idk.The company is fine and innovative. the stock is a meme stock, a joke. a money making jokeBecause In 5 years he will be a millionaireWhat are some reasons why it wouldnt be added?OofSeptember (Q3) is when they typically rebalance.Sell when they stop growing. Should be a few decades,You sound like you believe in the efficient market hypthesis. Nothing about their earnings or the gigafactory or model Y warrants the price going 5x in a few months. 

The criticisms of Tesla half a year ago are still very much valid today. Just because the stock value completely detatched form any actual value in the company because every average Joe with a smartphone has heard "tech is the future", doesn't mean the stock isn't wildly overvalued as is. 

>Bottom line: Don't blindly follow the market sentiment about stocks. Do your own research. Sometimes Mr. Market Man is very wrong and eventually sees the error of his ways.

Blindly following the market sentiment IS buying TSLA lol. Just look at the growth the past 6 months, the vast majority are buying into the hype. Doing 10 mins of research would make you realise how overvalued it is, so the only reason for buying after researching would be to speculate on the hype or a potential tech breakthrough that 10x their revenue.

Yes reddit has been criticizing TSLA. Yes TSLAs price has multiplied. That doesn't mean what reddit is saying is wrong, it just means that you have to ignore analysis, value, and risk, and rather just specualte on the effects of group psychology in the stock market.YesHaters madNot if it’s good news lolDisI’ll stick with my statement thanks. Yours is false and nonsensical.Google is already there...I really don't see how Visa or JJ will ever join the T club, atleast over other companies. The former benefits from a duopoly that's not guaranteed to always last. Innovation in transactions, digital banking and money management in general is intense. And with things moving more and more into digital banking and online transaction other companies do it better. 

Don't get me wrong I'm a bull on V, but I'm just being realistic. Tesla would easily get there before either JJ or V. Walmart? JPM come on manI didn't say that. I didn't actually offer any opinion on it. However, I expect a, umm..lively call.That 1.5 billion would mean that roughly 30000 cars were delivered but not payed yet. There is no way that is true.1. Customers not having payed yet would amount to 30000 cars. Very unlikely. 

2. Recording pre orders as actual income is very similar to what Enron did back in the day.I did

 [https://imgur.com/a/iC0Ppzp](https://imgur.com/a/iC0Ppzp)NiceFF🏆🥇🏅🎖Bought at 320 and some at 260 after bank reduced their Target price to under $200. I haven't bought since thinking it's overvalued. At this price, it is overvalued.FHere, have another upvote.FMost up voted at 188 lol2021 will be awesome for you then!Sell some of it! Hedge your betsI think people foresaw this sort of growth, just in 15-20 years and not three months.Dude bro...my dumbass sold my shares in August. Look who's been roundhouse kicking themself in the face for 11 months.How much you made from that?How many shares do you have?Just saying a lot of people probably sold when they were up 100% or even lessI think they could definitely do a stock split if this maintains. It would be beneficial I feel likeThere just are not that people on Reddit who can remember back to the days when it was $200, because that was like a year and several cars sold ago.While 1600 may happen at any time And is even probably likely. I wouldn’t want to miss out on a perfect storm of indexes loading shares for sp500 inclusion,  short sellers covering and Robinhood fanboys just to protect a $100 or so a shareIt's joining the S&P500 so all ETFs invested in that index will be forced to dump fuck tons of money into TSLA.What makes you think their business is going to take a hit in the upcoming years? Because if you don't think that they're definitely going to 5000 in the next 5-10 years.Less than 0.1%Tesla, unlike Ford, is a growth stock. It's not about what their market share is right now but where it will be years from now based on their headstart in battery tech and AI.All that is true.  But someone posted a while ago that every time they didn’t buy TSLA they wished they’d bought it. This is a stock where you can pretend it exists in its own little magical world, and from there decided do I want to see how this ride goes?  Because a logical analysis of things will prevent you from entering into the fun.  And hey, a huge part of this is fun factor at least for me.They are building factories as fast as they can, they sell real products made of tons of materials solving real problems.None, they make a mess of their index if they don’t add it.

sooner rather than later is more likely.Luckily I was smart enough to not go all in like some WSB type dummies. Just a couple hundred on long shots. If I had sold before market close I would’ve profited ~20%> Nothing about their earnings or the gigafactory or model Y warrants the price going 5x in a few months. 

You want to talk about irrationality? Look at Tesla's share price from 2014 to 2019. It went nowhere. It was stuck in the $200 to $300 range.

Then the Tesla Model 3 comes out, and starts landing on a number of best seller lists in 2019, and Tesla posted a profit in Q3 and Q4 of 2018. You'd think that would justify an increase in the stock price, right? Nope, TSLA's stock price went DOWN, it even fell below $200 a share at the height of Mr Market Man's absurd bearish sentiment. 

There was a trigger to it sure, the Q1 2019 deliveries were lower than Q4 2018's numbers. People ignored the fact that auto-sales are seasonal, and all automakers sell more vehicles in the second half of the year than the first half, and took Tesla's 2019 Q1 sale numbers as a bearish sign, even though Q1's numbers were much better then they were a year ago.

> The criticisms of Tesla half a year ago are still very much valid today. Just because the stock value completely detatched form any actual value in the company because every average Joe with a smartphone has heard "tech is the future", doesn't mean the stock isn't wildly overvalued as is. 

A lot of the criticism of Tesla in 2019 was that they were on the verge of bankruptcy. I think that's been very thoroughly debunked as nothing but wishful thinking given Tesla was profitable in 6 of the last 8 quarters, and how good Tesla is at raising more funding when necessary.

> **Blindly following the market sentiment IS buying TSLA lol**. Just look at the growth the past 6 months, the vast majority are buying into the hype. Doing 10 mins of research would make you realise how overvalued it is, so the only reason for buying after researching would be to speculate on the hype or a potential tech breakthrough that 10x their revenue.

> Yes reddit has been criticizing TSLA. Yes TSLAs price has multiplied. That doesn't mean what reddit is saying is wrong, it just means that you have to ignore analysis, value, and risk, and rather just specualte on the effects of group psychology in the stock market.

Timing is everything in the market. If you're buying into TSLA now you're probably FOMOing. But if you did your research and bought into TSLA in the $200's and $300's back when the hype that TSLA was going bankrupt was rampant in the media and at reddit you were going against the market sentiment. That's when I bought, that's when a number of prominent finance channel Youtubers bought into it.

As to the valuation of TSLA today, I think there's sides to this. 

On one hand I actually agree with you that I wouldn't buy into TSLA today, because the risk of Mr. Market man reversing course and hating TSLA stock again in the near future is too high. I think odds are good we eventually see a pull back, quite possibly to $700, or maybe worst case $500.

On the other hand, I think you're not valuing Tesla correctly. Tesla's not as simple as something like KO or JNJ to value. I **did not** buy TSLA for what numbers they'd post in 2019, or 2020, or 2021, or 2022, or even 2023. I'm looking over a decade out in 2030, as are many other TSLA longs. I believe TSLA has a **massive** opportunity to grow into a trillion dollar company overtime. I think TSLA will be producing around 10 million BEV's a year by 2030.

The other automakers are huge today yes, and sell millions or tens of millions of vehicles today, yes. But guess what, not all market incumbents survive when new technology disrupts the market. Nokia utterly dominated the cell phone market, they sold 9 of the 10 best selling cell phone models. And yet that market dominance couldn't save them when Apple came along with the iPhone, Nokia tried to adapt to the technology shift, but they were too slow and too late.

The legacy automakers are trapped in a damned if they do, damned if they don't situation. They're making a bunch of money off of ICE vehicles right now. If they switch to selling BEV's they'll be cannibalizing that lucrative money maker, and they'll need to pour tens of billions of dollars into the R&D and other expenses of shifting to BEV's. And just like Tesla struggled to make a profit selling BEV's for a while, so will the legacy automakers when they make the shift. So why would they want to shift to BEV's in the first place?

Well, because if they don't they WILL die when BEV & battery tech improves to the point that they reach cost parity with ICE vehicles. By that point no one will want an ICE car, and it'll be far too late for them to shift to BEV's.I'm long TSLA so wotNo that’s actually what “sell the news” means, you buy on rumour of good news and sell when it happensLmao what, you're fucking dumb lolNot to mention they only "profited" due to $465M of gov directed money they received. Without that windfall of "regulatory credits" they would have a big loss.

As more car makers produce electrics (a lot coming out in the next year, btw) the value of reg credits go down big.I don’t want anymore upvotes“Don’t put all your eggs in one basket” is all wrong. I tell you “put all your eggs in one basket, and then watch that basket.” -Andrew CarnegieLet it ride.I had 40 shares, so profited almost 20K.  It sucks that it’s hard to view that positively.  I only bought back 10 shares today.Not enough. Only 45. At the end of the day I’m always to scared to pull the trigger on more. I look back at all the ups and downs that I should have been loading up. I should have followed my gut all the way but instead I always worried about timing it. I expected bigs things but nothing like this past year. I thought $1k was crazy. I thought numbers like this were years away.Pretty much any stock will probably have a lot of people sell it by the time they are up 100%.

But there are a lot of people that strongly believe in Tesla and Elon and are not going to sell their Tesla stock for at least the next decade no matter what. I'm one of them.Stock spit would be great for everyone👍To qualify for S&P500 they have to do a stock split. Someone correct me if I’m mistaken please.You have a point.  Thank you.Dont forget shorts running for cover too 😉That’s what I’m saying, at this valuation they should have 10% market share or more, and that is no where insight. 

Also other car manufactures like VW are competitive with self driving more then the average consumer knows. 

No denying battery tech is ahead,  but I feel it’s a still more of a pop culture thing. Celebrity types hype Tesla hardcore.May I introduce you to the world of gambling my friend?You never know it might dip. Kind of relying on someone like you buying back to stop the dips going too low.

The problem is, Tesla shorts seem to be trying to lose money so they short low and buy high, this has the opposite effect to that which you would expect options to have as it makes the swings bigger. Shorts have literally spent more than Tesla has on getting this far.

I beg of you shorts, stop being so retarded all this up and down is going to give me motion sickness. Short high and close your position when it goes lower, it really is that simple. If you don’t want the Money you would make give it to charity.👍🏼😃👍🏼Good news leading to a catalystThat’s still a legitimate source of revenue though. Sure, maybe it’ll go down in the future, but it’s not shady at all to count a legit source of income.Next time maybe if you have that many shares sell them 5 or 10 at a time? You'll never get the best exit price but also never the worstI mean.. damn. You did good. Do you plan on taking some profits anytime soon or you long on 100% of your shares?

So you're up like 65k ish?They'll just keep comparing it to old cars and use that as a barometer. Oh well, everyone I know is waiting for the dip and when it comes, they believe it's the end of the "scam" so they don't pull the trigger. One day, 10 factories later, they'll buy it at 5k or whatever.Not it wouldWhat do you think it’d be? Like 7-1 split like Apple did years ago?Dont let a random person convince you away from your original thesis that easilyWhile pop culture definitely has a huge role I think it’s important to note the potential that Tesla really has to literally change the world. Tesla is an innovator and aiming not only to be a car company but also contribute significantly to other industries (I.e. trucking, batteries, insurance, etc.). It’s truly fascinating because at this point I don’t think anyone can really quantify just where Tesla is headed, but all signs point up. They have some ambitious innovations that might fail or underperform but they have too many things going for them at this point to be anything other than a major player in the world 5-10 years down the line.Er they already have 17% EV market share. Unless you want to deny we are all moving to EVs over the next decade. And they have a heck of a lot bigger market share of the energy market than any other car manufacturer.

Even VW will admit (Yep that has happened) they are not competitive with Tesla on software.   


You have literally written some of the reasons for why it is not just hype.That’s very much it for me!  It’s like gambling but you have slight control over the play. Plus there’s a constant stream of new information to look at. How’s this even legal?Sure, but when so much of your profits come from a revenue source that is guaranteed to decline, you shouldn’t be valued like the world’s best growth stock.Yeah, that’s exactly what my wife told me to do, but I thought I was being smart by selling before the next Great Depression.   She’s been giving me shit every day for months now.I know I should. It’s the smart play. But I think I’m sticking it out. I regret not buy more during the dips so much that I don’t wanna part with any.  Who knows where this goes but I trust Elon and I like the big picture long term.All fair points and have only been proven correct to this pointFair. However, they were still able to be profitable during one of the worst and fastest economic downturns ever. Regardless of how they got their profit, that’s impressive. Also, do we not see them bringing in increased revenue after this covid stuff ends and people have their jobs back..?Well hey at least she's interestedIt’s never gonna go back to anywhere close to where you bought so no matter what you’ll always have huge gains. Congrats. It’s like a nice savings account. Should you need any $$ can always sell a share or 2 at a time.I thought the same as you about Zoom back in March so I never bought into it, but it's been up double since then for weeks now. I definitely should have bought on the news. Should have bought Tesla when it was skyrocketing toward 900 too.

I don't know man, instead of buying news maybe just buy long-term holds, that way you don't panic sell or lose sleepTrade the news. Invest in good companies with good financials that you’ve looked into and understand.I disagree, as good news rallies can last a number of days.I don’t believe this is always true; not everyone knows what to do with any given news. We could interpret the news completely different and our plays can reflect that.That's not true mate, the thing is there are no short formulas like the one you are trying to synthesize, no simple standard procedure, and navigating through that is really unsettlingI'd like to offer an extension to your philosophy.

A lot of things are priced into stock market prices, including the news you "discover". There is an industry of analysts that read the news you're referring to as well -- SEC filings, research studies, etc. In fact, I run a company that uses NLP to help these analysts automate their news-oriented research.

The people that make the biggest stock market wins use "second-level thinking" (as per Howard Marks' book), or have a "non-consensus view" that is correct in the long run.

In other words, read the news and look for "bandwagon trends and fads" where everyone thinks the world will go in *direction A*, but you think it'll go in *direction B* (thanks to your research).

As such, when I read news or do research, I ask myself "Does this give me a point of view that no one else has?" and "Do I think I'm right?"

Cases in point:

* Remember when Tesla was at $50 and everyone thought it would go bankrupt?
* Remember when Shopify went public at $30 and everyone thought a Canadian ecommerce company couldn't be competitive?

Those are the sorts of bets I look for... You make a non-consensus bet and you end up being right.

These bets pay off 30x+, and even if you're wrong most of the time, they financials work out well. You just need to do *a lot* of news reading and research.Look at AZN. Disclosure in the news, stock popped. As of Friday night, it was still going up.What I've learned is that I should basically only ever invest in companies where I know stuff about the industry they're in, have heard of the company before or regularly use their products, and am confident that they will still exist in 10 years.

anything else is just gamblingAlgos run everything, sociopaths are at the helmI just want to add that in the morning of 23rd March, when the federal reserve announced its infinite QE, I immediately went in to trade the Dow, I put £1,000 in, using CFD’s (a leverage derivative instrument in the U.K.) of 30:1. And tripled my money in 5 mins. Sometimes it’s good to trade the news. But a lot of times it may already be priced in, especially when it comes to a company specific news.It depends on timing. I buy at market open based on after market news from the previous day, cross referenced with after market movements to get a feel for the sentiment. It's not big or clever and may not work beyond the current volatility we are seeing, but it's a way of still using news to give leads.You should consider joining a cultNot always the case. New partnerships is an example. Another is when good news comes out during a red day or downward trend. Sometimes you get a pop in the stock price but then completely evaporates because the overall market tanks. Earliest example is when AMD announced a partnership with Nvidia. AMD popped to $59 then the market started taking it back down to $51.Heard NFLX was down 10% from Reddit. Wasn't too late on that news to buy the dipBuy the rumor, sell the news.I think it's a bit more complicated than that. Because people process information in different ways. So it kinda depends on how analytical you are with the news presented to you. And how much information you put together from different sources. Markets always overcompensate positively and negatively so it's about how you can exploit those to some extent too. What you said is generally true for day trades. But value investing still holds strong. Take cloud services for example. I'm inclined to believe that these will grow in importance over the next few years. But because the payoff is in the future, I need to put together other sources to make an informed decision as to who I think will be best poised to take over that space. That bit is part speculation I guess and where the rewards lie.This isn't necessarily true. If you use a brokerage like We Bull you can make news plays because it opens at 4am. A common play is to wait for other brokerages to open in premarket at 7am for a potential spikeFalse, I’ve made tons of money on TSLA, AZN, MRNA, DKNG, AMZN, FSLR, WMT just buying into the news and riding the momentumUsually it's true, but it's important to recognize when you're truly early to a story. Many of us knew about coronavirus and it's potential to cause mass shutdowns as early as January or February. This would have been ample time to play the news. I got some weird looks wearing a mask that early.

And that you can also be too early. If you bought SQQQ when Wuhan shut down, you'd have been bagholding an uncomfortable length of time.Depends tbh, many people buy on the news and make it as the green candles can run for several days on end.Your mentor is right. Nobody can really predict the market, that’s the beauty of it. However you can discipline yourself to avoid emotional decisions and saying consistent. True, we may not be able to be as great as Wall Street, but we can minimize our losses. As I once read in the intelligent investor by Benjamin graham, “ there’s a reason why the bell always rings in Wall Street when it closes , because no matter if the average investor lost money or the stock market was down, Wall Street still made money”I'm fairly new to investing & trading but it's exactly this that made me think trading based on technical analysis is the way to go. You still need to have an eye on the news to make sure you're not trading into something unexpected but at least it no longer matters as much if you're at the back of the queue.Depends on the news. Some news can create momentum, and be a multiplier to future growth. Like I believe Walmart+. Others are more of a one off jolt. Like say layoffs, leadership changes, or minor acquisitionsI agree. Most stocks that expect to either hit there earnings or more are already priced in beforehand so the people buying after it are basically just buying the premiumYup buy the hype sell the newsI thought I heard something like buy on rumor sell on news somewhere on the subreddit. Maybe the other way around?Yes and no. Personally, with the state in which the stock market is in, I do not believe the market is efficient at all (efficient markets hypothesis). Many investors these days are often irrational and there is a lot of emotion in the stock market that direct influences price action and trading. Take Spotify for example: when they announced the Joe Rogan exclusive deal, the stock barely moved in price - give or take a week or two, and the stock runs up around 30%.Depends if you're only trading or investing. If you're investing then you find good companies that you can convince yourself will be worth more in then next few years and buy them. If you're trading and it isn't your job then don't do that and start investing.While I would agree, many other buyers who don't follow this philosophy will buy on news and possibly continue to drive the price up. You can go along for the ride.It may be too late to buy, but it is not too late NOT to buy.Don’t conflate ‘news’ with a ‘trend’.  News is a moment in time when a CEO gets fired or an earnings miss.  A trend grows and shrinks over time.  You cannot time the market on news because computers exist now.  But thanks to Reddit, Twitter, your profession, hobbies and interests you can bet on trends.Read news, then still do your research on the companies yourself. If you believe in it because it is a great company, invest.

Because if it is a great company, there will ALWAYS be news about them in the future, but you are already in so you will become ‘higher’ in the food chain then.

There is never a too late when it comes to great companies. High can go higher.

Think about it, if there is just 1 definite chance to buy a company, that means the company is shitty, right? Because it assumes that afterward the price is gonna stay the sameeeee forever after the surge.

But great companies they always go higher, especially after crash.

Fun fact, for great companies like AAPL or AMZN, you can look back and just buy when the stock hits all time high, you could make banks. All time highs are usually followed by a bunch more all time highs. Again, if its a great company.

Don’t listen to stock mentors, they are just teaching speculation and burn you money. Invest in companies you believe in by dollar cost averaging (buying a little every once in a while) and you will do very well.Sometimes news can come out about a potential event happening/not happening, and the stock moves up some but has more room to go up if the news comes to fruition. I just don’t think you can make a blanket statement regarding your research being fruitless as there are too many unique scenariosThat's basically the way George Soros invests, and he has made billions.

Invest based on what you think will happen based on what has happened, not on what has happened.I agree with this - here’s my example: I’m holding zoom stock even though there’s the threat of people going back to work. Why? Because my medical school and practically every other educational institution of any type in the country (except for primary school cuz Trump is a moron) has dumped millions into Zoom classes for Fall and Spring semester for everyone. They won’t take the risk of in person lectures, only in person exams. I think zoom will go up more once the Fall semester gets going this August and it’ll show in Zooms earnings in Sept. This just a bet on what might happen but it’s better than waiting for the news to come out.I've been investing in NIO a lot and I nearly shit my pants when they dropped below $11, all because Goldman Sachs downgraded to a sell. Turns out GS bought more on this dip and it's back near $14 days later. I've decided that I'm long on this shit because the stress of reading into these minor fluctuations that have nothing to do with company fundementals is indeed panic-inducing.Motley Fool recommended zoom last year in oct or nov. I thought: who gives a shit about video conferencing?I’m still kicking myself from back in Sep 2018 when my FIL stopped by and said “Did you see Tesla dropped to $340-something after Elon smoked pot?” And I replied “Eh, $340 is still too rich for my blood for Tesla stock...” 

When they invent time travel, I’m showing back up just in time to kick myself in the balls right after I say that.Good outcomes do not equal good investmentsThe mentor assumes everything is always priced in. As long as trading algos aren't being written by other algorithms but by human beings, I refuse to believe that's always the case.This! Specifically, "understand" is the most important bit for me. I find that my judgement of whether a company is doing well or will do well is 100x more accurate when I understand their product and business. I use this judgement to decide where to invest, but ride the news wave elsewhere to trade and make a quick buck.Where do you look for this info outside of a Google search?Made good $$ from Walmart + news.> can last a number of days.

This is where some of us get in trouble. We make the right move buying quickly only to hold to long and before we know it we missed the gains that lasted only for a couple of days. End up selling for a loss after holding days or weeks to long.True, but I'm not laying out a formula.  Just a philosophy which plays a small yet present role in my investment strategy.This happened to me. I bought Tesla over a year ago at 200ish. Watched it go down some and read negative article after negative article about how they'll go bankrupt and Elon will ruin the company. Always held because I believed in what the company was doing and how soon they would be the standard. 

That being said, the hype rn is too insane imo and I cashed out at 1600 for about 1400 of profit per share. 

Will definitely get more tesla when it levels out or drops below 1k. Really hoping for it to get back down to 400 thoughLove this.  ThanksIn my opinion there will be gains in steps along with release of news of the vaccine phases. Imagine the stock value upon final approval of vaccine. Also I'm positive that this funding and infrastructure is going to lead them into future research and products. So as I've said before with Moderna - "the pumping doesn't stop until final climax and they haven't even started to sing yet".  There are going to be 2 more solid points of increase for both those companies.Is there a 30:1 for SPY?That’s for r/pennystocksIt's true though. I didn't put much, but I remember when PG&E tanked after a fire destroyed a part of California and they got bailed out. That stock skyrocketed and I missed that. The next year, I read that PG&E was on the brink of bankruptcy after California experienced another big fire. I put my money in when it dipped around $3-$4 and sold at $6 a couple of weeks later. It went higher, but I was satisfied with my gainsI've often found that if you are a long term investor.  Short term volatile plays will play out differently in your mind.  If a big drop scared you it may mean you haven't done enough research to really adopt a long term stance on the company.  Because whenever I see big drops on companies that I know will be a long term hold. It's almost always a great buying opportunity.Same with me. I was beating myself on why i did not see at 16, then sold some at 13 and further at 12. But finally I bought back some at 11. Overall I might have made couple of hundreds bucks but too much headache. I should just hold and forget NIO for few years. Company seems to be doing great and delivering on its dates and allIt's only gone above $11 once to $14 and it's currently at $11 so I have no idea what you are trying to say about a rebound that hasnt happened yet.Don’t fucking scare me like that bro. It’s sitting at 11 wymmmmI know gs have some ownership of them, but do you have any data that they bought more after the ratings downgrade? That would be super interesting to seeMotley fool reccomend so many things every week, they are overdue for a meta analaysis.They recommend everything though, so that doesn't mean muchDo they have a good track record of stock picks? Or are they hit or missLol $5 stock or $500 stock doesn't matter profit is profit. One of those things that holds investors back.If time travel is ever invented, people will come back and pump Tesla up to 2k...


Wait a sec...I'm still learning and essentially of the same mentality as you, eg once I start hearing about it, it must be too late. A good philosophy but not  wholly true. 

My conslusion is to use news and other sources (read: people!!)  to hone in on a few companies you align with. If they're suddenly "trending", I'm always wary- eg Afterpay on Reddit in the last few months. If you happened to be like me and following the stock for months, you would have known March was a key time to buy. But it didn't really start "trending"  until it was already 2-3x this price. Sure, it went to 6x the March numbers but I would consider that hype "too late". I would still have considered myself "late" in March compared to maybe those higher up in the chain of information, but it would have worked out pretty well for me anyway!

A stock broker was famously quoted before the 80s(?) recession (sorry can't remember exactly now)- when asked how he knew it was time to get out of the market, he responded that it was when he started hearing everyone on the street giving advice and opinions on stock, like shoe shiners. He got out before a huge recession. I can't help but feeling the market is like this right now.

So my conclusion is to find stocks you like. Justify why you believe they are good picks. Follow their progress over some time to see how the stock generally behaves (particularly if it's a new stock) and buy at a low.  The best thing I learnt is to talk to people! They might give you new insights. My two uncles both invest and I talk to them occassionally about any stocks they have their eye on/why. Then I might do my own research. Think about the current and future of markets. The impact of covid. What stocks do you believe are currently low BUT also very likely to rise in the future? There's your undervalued stock. 

Just some newbie advice from a similar perspective400? Those days are long gone. You’ll be lucky to even see 1000. I’ve bought 200 to 1500, sold at 1750 and bought back in at 1450 - it’s going to 10k by 2030 easily. Don’t see it going any lower anytime soon with q2 profitabilityYes sir. Any index pretty much. Whereas for stocks it’s only 5:1.It’s for all stocks. Specifically any speculative swing play really.To be honest, it's not that I haven't done my research, it's that I know I should be long term investing but I'm greedy and just want that shit to grow. I'm not patient enough. Nio was my first ever investment back in January and it grew so fast that I wasn't used to seeing it tank ever. Once I'm more experienced and once I expand my portfolio I'll improve in this regard. And I did actually buy the dip, cus my research has been pretty extensive and I opted to stick to the fundementalsMy best case scenario is to sell enough stocks around the $30 dollar mark (assuming it gets there) to give myself some nice fat stacks, and then leave the rest for the very long term. 10 years from now, even 5, there no telling how big it could getIt's actually 13.71, it moved a lot after hours on Friday.I've been looking for actual proof, can't find it. Have seen people talk bout it factually and one guy even said how many shares they bought but no one gave a link or sourceI have Motley Fool but I'm inclined to agree with Warren Buffett and focus on 3 or 4 stocks that I know well and are great run companies.Wouldn't touch Motley with a 10-foot pole. Just because they're right every once in a while doesn't mean they know what they're talking about.In my experience pretty good. They recommend TTD all the time and it's one of my best performers. Same with fastly, since I bought it's gone up about 200%. I would say most of their recommendations are pretty good. I have a portfolio of trades that come from them that I end up choosing which ones I like most, it's always in the greenIt's about deciding what kind of trader you want to be and realizing that you can protect your money with stops and research. The problem comes in when you think you can day trade from the desk from your regular 9 to 5 job. Investing 5 k in the market is fine if you're willing to part with a 12 percent loss on a bad trade if you're playing on short term windows.

The main issue here is that these people don't have the finances to think 5k is the minimum to start out. They think 500 in a RH account invested all in some 0.60 stock is going to go parabolic and make them a couple thousand in a weekAutomation is what we all yearn for, with 5G, everything is gonna be faster, and i don't understand why people still think it is a long way to go. It will only take 5 years when people start to realize we are slower than machine.I guess we'll find out. I'm with you completely on how valuable it really is, I'm a huge huge tesla fan. I agree 400 is probably gone. I'll likely buy in around 1000-1200, because I do think right now it's overhypedWhat is it called...,I started investing in NIO when it IPOed but small incrementals . Eventually my stack of NIO grew to 1000 shares. Now I have 750. I have TSLA like hopes for this this stock and am not gonna reduce my position on this now.There are not much fundamentals, you are either the buyer or the seller. What determines the price is from one's mindset. If you look in to the future, it's easily predictable, every sci-fi movie has it. You just have to realize whether it will happen sooner or later. To expand one's porfolio, is like choosing tech/lifestyle that are far beyond present.  After all we are mostly short-sighted. Or else we be rich all the time. I give a perfect example, i created an odd porfolio back in February, with 32 random stocks, of course one was hype, MRNA, and somehow the others are catching up lately. And this portfolio kind of catching up with other porfolios i created for a subscription. The only thing that hinder one's decision on buying or selling is only time constraints.It's sitting at 11.09Oh well I'm on robinhood so I probably cant see shit. Still shows $11. for meThanks for looking. I would say the evidence is fairly crucial here, as you never know what the intentions are of people posting (possibly) baseless statements/accusations like that..I've literally seen two articles with opposing recommendations within a day of each other and no new info to cause a change. I've seen that shit on Market Watch too. Both are bullshit.That’s what I thought, thanksIt is literally the SPY itself, like it’s not a separately listed instrument. The broker just provides the leverage themselves, where you gain a profit or loss, at the price you entered and closed the trade, hence Contract-For-Difference.

EDIT: Not available in the U.S as it’s illegal.It's possible I'm wrong, but Revolut trading tracks after hours price movements and it says 13.71. I know for a fact that Trading212 does not, and it read 11.10. I'm pretty sure it's 13.71 dudeAre you a Fool subscriber? I am and I have not seen that happen from the stand point of the stocks they recommend.It sounds like you’re not using Motley Fool the way it should be used.  Use it a one of multiple datapoints to do further research.  

Here’s 2 examples, 

1. They recommended SE around the end of last year.  That data point alone isn’t important but then I saw Zacks put it in their top 10 stocks for the 2020 as well and that caught my interest because usually they don’t have a lot of overlap in their recommendations.  The combination of those two datapoints caused me to start doing more research on it and liked what I found on how they were trending so I bought in late dec.  That investment 3xed for me already (sold my originally Investment and will let the profits ride for the foreseeable future.

2.  I picked up LVGO and TDOC after finding them on motley this spring because I like that space (even post Covid) and I think we’re going to see connected health and telemedicine continue to grow.  Both of those have 2xed for me this year.  So motley gave me the idea of the companies to look into and I did additional research to determine it was good company to invest in.

There are tons of stocks that Motely, Zacks, yahoo finance and morning star recommend that I choose to pass on but it’s a great way to get ideas for stocks to look into and research more.  Just my two cents (not financial advice).I'll admit I've never used Revolut before so I won't say your are wrong. Have you seen such a large discrepancy in the past and it turned out the Revolut price was the correct one? Just curious. I'll be interested to see what it opens at on Monday.Just the standard Apple Stocks app says $11.09 at close and $11.01 after hours[deleted]Last trade for after hours was $11, where are you seeing $13.71?It didnt open anywhere near $13.71... RH was off by 0.42c on open.[deleted]I've definitely noticed robinhood being very off on what a stock opens at. I wanted to get in on something and realized how high it jumped as soon as it went live.Yeah, it's happened once or twice and Revolut was correct. In the other apps, it just shows an instantaneous rise/fall when market opens again. I think this rise was due to a statement about salesLet's remember to come back here Monday and figure out which one is right lol, it would be pretty bonkers for Revolut to be this wrongThe interface is dope and the after hours feature is helpful, but you can't set limit buy or sells, so it's only good for straight up long term investingRevolut. It says $13.71 right now in my app.I'm honestly very confused by the situation. I didn't get to watch all of the pre market movement, and by the time I looked it was 11.56 or so. So I don't know if it was actually up there, and came down, or if it was blatantly inaccurate.Well for me it they add plenty of values and opportunities. Their track record with me is ok. 252% on my initial investment. Any were for $3 stocks to $1,500 stocks. I only wish I would have joined them earlier. I like their methods. Of course they have recommended some stocks that haven't beaten the S & P but they are on average well above the S & P. But I'm a devoted follower on all levels.You are quite wrong in that, subscribe and put in you money for the long term. They did suggest some tendies at least a year or 6 months earlier.I guess that's good news but I was kinda hoping it would fall under $10 so I could but a bunch more shares. Win win I guess since I'm in for the long haul.!remindme 36 hrsThink that's off, my both my etrade and webull shows $11 for the last after market trades at 7:59 pm[$11 can be seen from the last minute trades ar 7:59 pm](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/nio/after-hours)I mean that's not just a little off. That's almost 20% inaccurate.Which premium service do you follow?So this morning (I'm in Ireland) my Revolut is reading $11.56 or so. Still a good bit higher than the $11.10 that other apps were saying. I still don't understand who or what can affect the market after hours, but Revolut does seem to be tracking itThere is a 29 hour delay fetching comments.

|-|-|-|-|Pretty sure they simply aren't tracking after market movementMotley Fool Advisor and Rule Breakers.Mine is saying 12.82 (8 am Central Time, USA) but maybe it’ll change at 9. Lets see what happens over hereReport posts that are low effort or break the rules. We remove them but it's hard to keep up, we are volunteers with jobs and families and can't spend all day here.

Automod and our mods catch a lot more than actually make it through to the sub, but it's impossible to have rules that catch everything without also accidentally removing a lot of solid posts with trigger words. We are currently removing dozens of shitty posts per day and dealing with the ensuing complaints of the users who posted them.

Tldr: report bad posts and downvote them, it helps more than making another post to complain.Don't forget the "i am 18 and have $5000. What stocks should i invest in?"The people who post about "bloodbaths" and stocks "plummeting" after going down like 2-3% are the fucking worst. Like jesus christ, stfu. Not to mention there was usually a giant run up right before it goes down...I’ve noticed this as well. I used to love this thread but over the past month you can tell it’s 99% newbies. Which isn’t a problem but it just no longer provides any substance or information that is worth the large amounts of time I usually spend on here. I’m not getting value like I used to. Over the past week I’ll find comments of people scolding or using condescending points that are completely factually wrong. But seem legit based on the confidence in which it’s written and no it isn’t sarcasm. It’s scary if you aren’t versed in enough knowledge to know what is BS and what isn’t. There’s always been BS on here but now it’s overwhelmingly so. But then again people should probably not trust reddit for their financial decisions in the first place.Completely agree.  I am tired of seeing posts like you mentioned or the S&P drops 2% and:

"Don't panic sell this is just a correction" or "The market has crashed should I buy this dip" or whatever other stupidity there is.

I used to pursues this sub pretty regularly but not anymore, I get little value and it's 90% "should I buy x" "is x overpriced" (where x is pretty much always TSLA)Yeah, I miss reading some interesting DD posts on here. Content got pretty stale with the influx of noobs/wannabe daytradersI completely agree. I constantly see people making a post about asking how to start and any advice people have for them. All they have to do is type in the key words in the search bar and they get the endless posts of people asking the same question.Agreed. Wish there was a way to limit the amount of threads per stock. Seems like there has constantly been 1 or 2 NIO topics on the front page for weeks straight. Is that really necessary for a relatively small $10b company?We need to impose a character limit minimum on posts, otherwise we’ll continue seeing these “I have $100 AMD or Tesla?” shitpostsSNR here is awful. The most vocal crowd seems to be ignorant beginners who think they know it all because they blindly invested in March and rode the wave up. It's sad.I also see posts from straight beginners who don't know the difference between being short or long and asking for advice. It looks bad in the sub if a large minority (say 20%) of the subscribers are beginners not knowing what they're doing. You can find out more by reading. Be inquisitive. Use Google for godsakes.Hey,  I left the house for an hour and TSLA was down almost 5%,  not 1% like you said in your post.I agreeIt's Reddit. It can't be taken seriously anyway. It's not going to turn into a serious discussion overnight.This pandemic has just turned the market into a game for most of these people. And I mean I understand why they think it is when the fed makes it rain and stocks have gone up with no fundamental reason to back it. It sure seems like a game. And this leads to stupid post like these because of the state of the market at this point. So while I hate them too, I understand why most people keep posting this crap. No one cares about DD or fundamentals anymore on reddit. Lost cause rnSir, this is a Wendy's drive thruThis is /r/stocks, not /r/investing, but yeah... agreed. Hopefully mods see this post.The only reason I stay subscribed is to revel in the tears when the bottom really drops out.I'm eagerly awaiting the next crash. I really don't want people to lose everything, but so many people are investing beyond their means and being far too risky because they've literally only have memories of a bull market.   I see time and time again on this subreddit that people are trying to help the new investors limit their risk and do their DD, but it's simply not sticking.  If you keep driving past all the warning signs and ignore them, there's not much anybody can do for you.Ive also seen many posts stating this as well which is ironicAgreed, I’m very much new, but if people took the time to just search this subreddit for their questions, they’ll 9/10 always find their answer and beable to back it up with another 2 posts.I have a considerable amount of experience in the market (more than the majority of people on this sub I daresay), and I started this account, and a blog in lockdown to share some of my knowledge with other people. 

The first post I make I get flamed in the comments by people who clearly haven't read the entirety of the DD. Hardly very encouraging for people who do contribute quality DD to continue is it?

Some ideas I have (besides the excellent ones already suggested re: minimum time subscribed, delete low quality posts etc.):

1. Create flairs that are awarded to posters that regularly contribute quality posts/comments; make the feed be able to be filtered by these (if it's possiblde technologically)
2. Create a heavily moderated megathread every week/whenever there's a big news story that relates to one stock only, and remove all comments that are low quality from that thread.Make a new subreddit dude, no problem. And let us know when you and we’ll all join I’m sure. You seem to have overwhelming support in this thread apparentlyYou can block literally anyone you want on Reddit.  Much easier than playing armchair modEverything I see a post saying "stay strong" I want to say no sell up get out because if you need to be told that you shouldn't even hold stockI don’t know why people bash r/wallstreetbets. Yes, it’s goofy, crazy or irresponsible but also it has the best humor, memes, and occasionally some quality DD or explanations by more experienced members. I still think it’s one of the best subs on Reddit with all its flaws.You’ve been on Reddit long enough now to know all good subs eventually turn to shit.Sure, I mean remove all comments about Tesla or Microsoft just like N.IO and wk.HS.

It’s so incredibly difficult not to sort by new or popular comments.

C’mon: don’t be lazy and expect the world to change because r/stocks doesn’t have content that makes you personally happy.

Definitely the rest of the world’s problem that you can’t filter. Let’s just censor more. 

Perfect universal solution to an individual problem. 👌🏻

What you find “irritating” is not the world’s issue.

Most of the US market is controlled by 30 primary stocks. We gonna quit discussing them because you don’t wanna hear about them anymore?Same, like yeah I’m gunna play AMD when it comes on down. But right now I’m investing in KO for some long term holds.Or implement robinhood level moderation where anything less that useful discussion gets shit on by the masses.its a bunch of 20  year old kids buying TSLA.   that's about it.

&#x200B;

The again, because of COVID, i have made some plays i NEVER would have normally and was successful.

&#x200B;

So even i made a post or two about Cruise lines before the rocketed to $26 range and crashed again.  i made a 100% gain and almost doubled all the cash i had to my name.

Never would have bought cruise-lines otherwise.  so the market crash is part of the reason so many dumb stocks are discussed here lately.Regrettably I'm one of the new guys but I've done my best to limit my posts to information that might be useful to *other people* as well as myself.

Not just spam "hOw dOes MY PorTFoliO LOoK?!"I agree. I'm new here and new to trading but so many posts, and specifically the ones you highlighted and made me question even being here. They'd pointless and silly. To the point where I'm asking myself if this sub is mostly 15yo's playing trader and commenting on every trivial thing out of excitiment> Over the past couple of months though, since the market rebound, the quality of content here, in my opinion, has massively declined.

It is much easier to be thoughtful in a steady market. When the afflictions of mania, chaos, and uncertainty strike, I think it should be expected that the rags of the day mirror the same.

This is why it is so important, imo, to look at how you might act in moments of gnashed teeth. When the shit show comes to town, what sort of tickets are you going to have? Of course, you can't predict everything, but *the market* has a pretty binary state of UP or DOWN.I've read posts similar to this every couple of months and will continue to do so (proof is in the pudding)Not a regular on this thread but it’s likely due to the pandemic and the sudden urge to make money doing what people believe is easy to do. Hence the newbies asking basic questions or what should I invest in?I agree, we should ban all posts with “TSLA” in the title at this point.The sub is looking for entertainment which drowns out things like research and genuine advice. Have I been guilty of posting things like "don't sell" and "... has dropped/jumped ...%"? Yes I have. But I have also tried to contribute to the best of my ability with extensive research down on things like the uranium and sportswear sector.

Now take a guess as to which of the two categories I just described got better engagement. Exactly.Oh another post about the state of this sub as if no one notices. Thanks for telling us kind sirCuntsEveryones trying to make a quick buckDon't feel bad giving these people wrong picks, they want to be spoon-fed everything smhOk, but what should I invest in? TSLA or AAPL? 😂😂😂😂😂I'm a newbie only doing this since may, but I've already made mistakes and I'm currently in the red but I'm ok with it and feel like I'm in this long term.

For others that are new but can't deal with being in the red maybe they will give it up and leave soon after realising that actually stonks don't always go up.You think that's bad, wait till the election heats up.Thanks for writing this. I've also noticed the same. You also get brutally downvoted if you write anything critical about the "favorite" stocks. People aren't interested in reading longer write ups. Also a lot of "I have $1000, what should I buy?" threads (again, if you respond, "buy these and these books" you get downvoted).Pretentious post.Why do you have 2 bring negativity when you finally do post?Then unsub or keep scrolling. No one is forcing you to be here. You really think complaining about it is going to change anything? Or did you just make this thread for fake internet points? Get off reddit and go for a walk.No one ever blames the Users who upvote the bad stuff to Hot. Can't stick it all on volunteer modsApologies if this seems like a rant at the mods - it’s not supposed to be. My point was rather that from the rules it’s not really clear that shitty posts aren’t allowed? 

I appreciate all the work that the mods are continuing to do in this time of growth in popularity of the sub!On another note, what if we had username flares connotating our self-assigned experience or years of trading experience?

That way we could easily discriminate! I mean, evaluate and sympathize!I have also experienced bullying if you state your honest opinion about stocks that are overvalued. I have been called "Idiot" and "Retard". I reported the comments but they are not deleted. If anyone is posting a cautionary opinions on stock that are being promoted here and then getting insulted, then what kind of quality discussion one can expect?EhhI’m 12 and have $1.34, which stocks do I buy?Hopefully this will change when unemployment falls"I put all my life savings of TSLA options! What should I do?"I mean I feel that one is okay because the person came here to learn to some degree right. They probably have no mentor to teach them. Let's not roll all posts together as the same.“I’m 13 and I have $500,000. What should I invest in if I want to 10x in 1 year?”people are spooked when it comes to their money. I fairly recently started my brokerage account knowing full well what I buy will be evaluated in 6 months, a year, 5 years etc. My girlfriend wanted to start one since I said it would be a good idea and I would manage it but god damn does she panic, almost to the point where I'm just going to close the account and pull her money out.New investors forget that 10% correction is pretty common and doesn't mean anything.I’m in agreement on all points. So what should we do about it?I'm a newbie and I can also tellThe people buying the BS and the people spouting it will either go broke or learn and the all the investing subs will normalize.I agree I've noticed the same thing. It's kinda sad tbh.I was going to do a big write up on the fintechs and my theory on how they will perform in the coming years, but frankly im not sure how valuable the responses on here are going to be. Ive already done most of the research I would just need to set a couple of hours aside to do the write up, but it feels out of place given the types of threads I see.My favorite question yesterday was “Should I dump MSFT?”We have one and have been discussing increasing it lately.SNR?Yeah, I feel like there is actually like no good subreddit for good read ups these days. It is all just crowded with the top 10 traded stocks.I'd say it's easily 35+ with the amount of posts recently. People should not invest if they don't they their own dd and blindly follow picksThe sad thing is that subs rarely recover. Once a sub hits a critical mass of active members, the discussion often degrades into a pile of meme poop and astroturfing.Ah yes. Apologies, have edited.Exactly. One young guy reached out to me and I’ve provided him some advice in a few personal messages.  So as a fairly experienced investor I’m glad I could at least impact one person. Those 90% of people will get smacked with reality at some point.Well, they are also focusing on the companies that have the best gains over the past 3 months, and just automatically assume that keeps upWhat election?This is a big thing too, the posts are on the front page of the sub because people are upvoting them.We are rewriting rules and should be out shortly. Simplified them as we found people just weren't reading them at all. Low effort is definitely something we remove as much as possible, unless it gets good discussion in comments in which case we may leave up.It's been discussed but no way to verify without a ton of extra effort on mods. And if self assigned it's really just a joke as anyone can say they have 10 years experienceI’m a fetus and have $100 in gift cards - what STONKs can I buy?You are thinking the same thing? That the market is going to shit itself when that happens?I'm just saying not to forget those posts since he was categorizing all the posts. Those kinds of posts are indeed welcome but after you see a few of those everyday you get tired of replyingI just inherited $50,000 what stonks should i buy?Using condoms is more effective than pull out techniqueSpend less time on Reddit unfortunately 🤣Prevent accounts that haven't been subscribed to this subreddit for at least a year from making new threads.And unfortunately it’s mostly newcomers/new investors who miss out on the main benefits of the sub from this. For those who already have a decent portfolio and some grasp of things this is mainly annoying, but the noise and memes in recent posts may make you get burnt from making the wrong decisions or having the wrong expectations if it affects your first investment.Honestly, even if it's mostly BS responses, there are still plenty of people who read the information and get value from it without ever leaving a comment (like me).Never comment myself but will read it.I'd be interested in reading it! Hopefully readers can downvote the useless responses and upvote the thought-provoking ones.Yeah, I get what you're saying. I didn't mind posting DD when looking into companies I was considering investing in, but to format it to look good on reddit and do all the little stuff always took a little extra time, and I felt like as of late it'd be drowned out in all the low effort posts.I don't mind those, since, if they gotta ask, the answer must always be yes. I suspect they're buyers high, sellers low, and so yes, always yes, turn that paper loss into a real one.Please do! And perhaps require a ticker symbol in the submission to prevent vague, general questions about investingPlease do.signal to noise ratioYeah, if there is one, I haven't found it either.Suggestion: I don't see a rule clarifying what kind of posts belong in the daily discussion thread. I use a "Belongs in megathread" rule in my sub so people can report and flag posts that should be removed and moved to the announcement megathreads. You'd *think* people would read the rules and announcement threads before posting but most people, especially new sub members, do not. 

There's enough users here that they should be able to help the mods out with identifying some of those posts.

*edit spellingTrue, but you could just have things like "beginner" - "novice" - "some experience" "experienced" "expert" "pro" kind of thing.

Not so that people can self label as pros, because you're right at least 5% of them would just be catfishing, but I think at least then as you're scrolling you can filter out posts by self-identified beginners.

At the same time I don't really care though so either way 💁

Ohhhh I just thought of something! What if you made flares for your brokerage? See where I'm going with this? 😉I’m a 2 year old in potty training and I have a nickel to invest - where can I get low risk 400% returns by Wednesday?Lots of catalysts. Not sure if any one is more important than the other. Eliminating the PUA is probably the most compelling.Just tell them to do a 100% SQQQ portfolioTrue. Is there a wiki page for here that automod could auto-reply with?yeah but then you gotta spend money and less money = less stonkOr more. You know, posting the kind of content you're asking for...2nd thisBut what good does that do him?Why would you use such an esoteric abbreviation instead of just typing it out?Good ideaWe try to be brokerage agnostic and don't want any brokerages to be getting traction from our sub. Could see webull or Robinhood sending spam users in with their flair to increase.

Self identifying isn't really an option here bc of the possibility of catfishing as you said, and folks calling themselves pros to then try to sell their advice, or push pump and dumps.  Mod verification is the only way we'd be comfortable with it to stop users from being preyed on and fall victim to pump n dumps from "pro" users, but we don't have the manpower to verify users in quantitySalty.Invest in POO, IN, and TLT and I'll give you a quarter.But do you think the market is going to drop rapidly when it runs outTry having a kid and see how much money will be left for stonksEither that or accounts have to be older than a certain timeframe, i.e. 1year, 2years, etc.Teaching is the best way to learn
. But other than that nothing lolMeh, I'm an engineer, it's a common abbreviation. I don't always remember that what's common for me isn't common for everyone before I type something.SNR is pretty common vocab for anyone stats/eng/cs/analysisMan you're thinking about this whole thing a lot more than I was.

I guess that's what mods are for though... All good points

Can we at least get favorite stock flares or something?

Favorite candy?Nah, Ima diversify — spread this shit out.Deal
  
  
Edit : fuck i missedLol. Nobody knows that.

It's about risk and reward.

If I think the market is overvalued, then I change my positions. If it is undervalued you adjust again.

There may be another day again this year where I'm having lunch and the market is down 8%. Or there may not. I'm thinking that we can fall another 20-30% from here by Christmas, but I'm not going to know a day or the week.Ironically, by using crappy abbreviations like SNR you are contributing to the noise.It's kind of a useful description of a sub actuallyYour getting alot of heat for using an abbreviation people may not know which makes no sense to me, but also gives an interesting view onto why the state of this sub has deteriorated so much.

Instead of people being curious and interested in learning something new, they are angry they didnt have the answers handed to them.i just got my software engineering degree and have never heard the term. I googled it and now am wondering why we never used that term since it seemed like it would have been pretty useful in some of our coursework. oh well buy more $SNRAlso candy would be sweet but starbursts or gtfoLol yeah sorry it's been brought up before and we've discussed but can't find a good way to work it. I'm thinking of addressing again, a self flair more around like day traders, long term investors, swing traders etc. To identify trading styleOf course, because if the reader needs to do a quick google search the post is automatically noise. Jfc.Jesus. Go take a stats class or something. Maybe it's your level of education that's the problem. Even the marketing wanks I've worked with over the years understand it./r/snrequalszeroRight? I'd use the fuck out of it to evaluate subsHey that would be a really cool way to add context to people's posts! I like it!"I'm in a field that .05% of people are in"
  
"MaYbE iTs YoUr EdUmAcAtIoN"I thought you were referring to a ticker symbol.Don’t be a cuntYou sound fun at partiesI get it, SNR = Zero because there is nobody in that's sub! Brilliant.I believe I recall it being mentioned in high school chemistry as well...Too lateI am! Super fun. I'm a happy drunk.I believe 90% of people have never heard the expression and thought you were talking about a ticker. Instead of understanding what up votes/down votes mean and acknowledging that you're wrong you're just digging your heels in to die on this hill. It's weird.Maybe you should stick partying then..It's "weird"? Really? I think it's weird that I have so many comments about it. I understand what "upvotes and downvotes mean" but I couldnt possibly care less about the opinions of the reddit herd. 

And jfc: it's not an "expression", or an "abbreviation", it's an initialism, and you people are morons."Everyone's telling me I'm being stupid. Am i being stupid? No...it's everyone else who's wrong. They are just jelly of me"Right, because the level of discourse on reddit, and especially this sub, is always top notch.I wonder why? Maybe it's because of people who insult other people when questioned about weird *expressions* and then continue to blame others when clearly the majority of people didn't understand the *expression*.Interesting. I noticed in China, a ton of people watch shows on their phone. India might be similar. Although in China the monthly price for a streaming service like iqiyi is 10元  a month (about $1.50).Cable in India is super cheap unlike US so it will be really hard to attract middle class families. 
Also, they will have to invest a LOT in making originals that placate Indian audience.
One of the biggest competitor Hotstar has collaborated with disney and it also streams live cricket matches which is a huge thing. 
Uncle Bezos is putting billions after billions in Amazon. That is another big competitors. Not to mention the biggest competition ‘piracy’. You can watch allmost anything on pirated website for free and people loves free thing.

I personally think Netflix is going to struggle for a long long time before they can start making anythingCan I VPN to India and grab me one of them cheap subs?4.7$ is too high for India if Netflix wants to capture the entire market and not just the upper class. The average monthly income in India is probably around 100-150$ per month. Middle class in cities is probably around 3x that.

Imagine if it cost you 3% of your income to buy Netflix. How many would.Maybe I'm spoiled but I don't even want to watch youtube videos in 480p, let alone binge a show in that shit quality.Even with this pricing, Netflix is way more expensive than other equally good, if not better, options. 

Disney+ has A ton of other stuff (live cricket, news, etc) and a yearly costs let's than two months of, Netflix top tier.

Amazon Prime yearly costs just 1.5 months of Netflix

You have work to do, Netflix!Here's a startup idea. You pay an Indian guy to open an account. He opens with his credit card. And both split the difference.[deleted]I am from India. It's true, many watch shows on their phones.I'm not super into the genres I know about, but it would be cool to get a glimpse into the Indian content produced, if they actually get respected producers on board.Disney owns hotstar and Star India outright so it's not really a collaborationYou'd pay money to watch Netflix in 480p?You need an Indian credit cardNope. Netflix’s geolocation detection can detect vpn and will not stream.Can confirm it works. My Indian subscription has been used in US, Australia, Dubai etc by my cousin's :)

You don't even need a vpn!

The 4k streaming on HDTV is priced at $12/month, still a bargain when compared to prices elsewhere.Only 1/3 of India owns a smartphone so capturing the "entire market" is not at all correlated with the average income. Even then you're only really looking at the subset of those users with enough data to justify streaming/downloading shows.Around 10% earn enough to be able to easily afford there plans which is roughly 140 million people.Sounds like cable lol.I dont know if I am spoiled. I don't like to watch on small screens as well. I will rather sit idle than binge watch shows on phoneTrue. It's not catching, data is very cheap in India. Netflix should reduce its price to gain more audience. 480p would have worked 5 years back.You're not the target user.Does Netflix have any big competitors there?Not the same guy but with my 3 mb/s WiFi in my home I watch everything on my phone. HelpThere are vpns that can get around that. Express VPN works. I use it to watch shows from Japan and Europe.Enjoy while it lastsData prices are, in my experience, very cheap throughout India, and connectivity is quite good in the south. It's also quite common to have a sort of "communal" smartphone within a family, that's shared between a couple and their children. That being said, a very large portion of the population doesnt currently use any kind of streaming platform at all.Yes but it’s not like it’ll be 1/3 forever. Eventually they’ll have around 80-90% penetration wi Th in 10 years. 

Despite incomes for the vast majority of people being very low, Netflix if it wants to capture the upward trend in incomes should shoot from a lower price and gradually raise it. I’m thinking somewhere in the range of 50c-1$ per month seems reasonable for now. 

Remember they’re also competing against free/pirated sources as well.Exactly. It's all about scale and India is the next open emerging market.Seriously, just give me a book at that point, lol.Prime and piracyAmazon Prime, Disney+ HotstarPrime, Disney, And our good old piracy..Prime has very good regional content and there is Disney + Hotstar  (local one). But for International content Netflix is way ahead of others. Problem is it's pricing which is much costlier than Prime and Disney.
Many web series of Netflix are very famous here.Main Probelm is pricing, if they don't reduce it, people in India would rather prefer piracy. Even this price is too costly for average Indian. Only people who benefit are those who do piracy.HotstarWell your phone probably displays a lot more than 480p and the Netflix app lets you download shows in advance. So just download the stuff you want to watch overnight and play it back in HD. No reason to settle for crap quality unless you're really watching a lot.What about Facebook, they love a good purchaseSince May, MSFT has done 5 acquisitions. With each acquisition, MSFT saw a 3-4% bump in their price (rescinded a few days later), with people continually [calling this pattern](https://unusualwhales.com/alerts/1045f484-db01-4eb4-ad04-43184e811da9) and printing in options trading. 

Here is the full history if you are interested of those acquisitions: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/acquisition-history.aspx

It is also important to note the uptick in the second half of the year. Has anyone looked at similar flow for other companies yet?Instead of just counting the number of acquisitions, you should chart the amount spend on acquisitions. 

Buying a $10m company is not the same as buying a $500m companyDo you think Amazon will buy out Sea Ltd./ Shopee?amzn has hooli thoughThis is great! I’d also be curious to see a graph that includes the dollar amount of the acquisitions, as those can range drastically.Don’t know the last time Microsoft did anything innovative, they just purchase other companies to stay up to date.Sources

I've seen similar "bar charts over time" videos and they all have the same style.Where did you find the data for this?Reminds me of DataisbeautifulCool.niceReputinlickers like Atty Barr are coming for your Apple, Google (even though they quit and banned in China) and I am wary.I maybe should have included them to be honest.They couldn’t get snap chat though!Pulling numbers out of my ass, the WhatsApp purchAse alone is probably 80% of their acquisitions.Yeah I've made a few pennies off buying calls in the dip then selling the next dayI agree, its like a 490m differenceIt's hard to do this because a lot of the time they don't disclose the value of the acquisition.Amazon should buy out or take out Wayfair. Amazon missed that low lying fruitSE is my largest holding at the moment. Currently \~18% of my portfolio. What makes you think they would acquire SE?Is there an animal I can bring in to represent the solid and efficientness of the acquisition? Maybe another elephant?Unless those companies stopped innovating, your claim isn't correct. Might as well say "Company X doesn't innovate. They just hire people who do."Teams? Azure? Edge? Dotnet core? Blazor? 100s others. You’re talking out your ass lmaoThere's a website called flourish studios.Can only be viewed in the oculus though.Worth itexactly.r/theydidthemathYeah a cabinet named after a missing girl for $10k is a steal 🤪So Amazon could take over their market.I’m not saying they hire people who do. I’m saying they just stay up to date, not innovating. Apple, Google, Amazon, Slack, Zoom were all innovators in their respective products which Microsoft just makes their own version for. They have just been riding the coattails of their 90s/2000s success in the enterprise space and have been treading water since (although Satya Nadella has done a fantastic job of late)How are any of those products innovative?

Teams: Microsoft version of zoom with a bit of slack (marketed towards office 365 users aka those already in Microsoft ecosystem)

Azure: Microsoft version of AWS (marketed towards office 365 users aka those already in Microsoft ecosystem again)

Dotnet core: was innovative in the 2000s, has been outdone by node.js and other web development frameworks since (especially mobile development)

They just haven’t been innovative and have been making copycats of successful products for their own environmentThank you! Can't believe I haven't seen that site before, lots of cool data visualization.That whole wayfair situation is completely bizarre.

I looked up the cabinets myself. Very very oddI hope. Have they acquired market share by acquisition before on this scale?Do you think most of Microsoft’s revenue is based on just Windows and Office? You do know that they have one of the largest public cloud platforms, second only to AWS, right?If you think nodeJS has outdone dotnet core, you're probably a fake developerYour comment about dotnet core is wrong. Asp.net (another innovative web framework by Microsoft) is the one from 2000s. Dotnet core 3.0 is newSuper bizarre, but so is all the rest of the pedo stuff that suddenly gets overshadowed by some other event and quickly swept under the rug.I don't know. It would be huge if they ever bought out SE. what do you think this coming week will bring in terms of SE value? Up or down?Yeah, you are reinforcing my point. AWS came first and remains the preferred platform for developers while Azure is better for companies already in the Microsoft Office 365 Environment. Every tech company, (and innovative company) uses the G Suite/AWS/Zoom/Slack/Okta/Atlassian platform instead of Microsoft 365 because of its better integration, user friendliness, and light weighted ness. Once more and more companies further their digitization, Microsoft will be left behind because of their lacking of these features.It usually pops after down days so not surprised we're green today.AWS invented Cloud Computing? Never knewHe didn't say that..in before it closes down on previous closeas much as i want to buy puts because amd always goes back down... i think they deserve this price and im just gonna hold my stocks this time around. AMD is a great companySold at $60 waiting for the fall to buy back in again.We have been waiting for that breakout for months. If you don't mind me saying, Hallelujah!Guess I was 2 months too late. Bailed on them a while ago when they weren't moving. Oh well.Is there a catalyst for the sudden spike?meanwhile microsoft and apple are starting to use arm processorsSmh at buying at 14.16 and selling at 31 like it was a good ideaMy very first investment as an investor (technically my second because I never speak of the first... went to $\*\*\* but shhh). Went really low because I was still learning the process, made a hefty gain from it.Thanks... for sharing?Im waiting for it to hit 65 and sellMan I bought in at like 13 bucks a few years ago and had to sell at 31 cause times got hard. It's great to see that it's made it this far and I'm proud to have a and build 😁👍🏻wow timing is everything. bought $60c on 7/13 hoping for that pre-earnings spike. Listened to the Gurus and set a stop loss just to not lose everything after it tanked which triggered last Friday. NOW THIS a few days later. All in or nothing from now on.Sold some AMD. Then it is zooming now. Do you guys sell and buy in the same day.Stock is shooting $70.I guess it is bye bye to $60.

ThanksReally nice potential break through strong resistance today and now on my long watch list.  Waiting for confirmation that this isn't a false break.probably going back down to $55-57 in the next few days, will dip my feet in thenWhat call price do you guys suggest I should go for this Friday, July 24 on AMDAmd is growing IMO because stimulus and at home have created alot of pc users. Intel has dropped the ball alot recently and like Microsofts xbox doesn't intended to properly rail itself anytime soon. All new tech coming out in Q4 and we will see a rise in thread rippers and low end cards from amd competing with Nvidea I hold both stocks as they do multiple media's. Amd also has car capabilities and is working with Ford. Keep this in mind.Noobs. You would've bought straight main vein calls if knew what was up. Intel CEO resigned, AMD has more efficient chips. Apple drops Intel for their chips. 

AMD is the new kid on the block.Bought puts for that very reason. I wouldn't be surprised if today was just a teaseI agree with you 100% I'm long amd and fully believe in them. I'm just playing the options game for funSame here. I'm not much of a trader, but have made good money on the constant swings between 50 and ~57, plus I don't mind holding AMD for a while if it comes to that.I’ve been swing trading this for months but now that it’s above 60 it won’t drop back down. Sure maybe 58ish but this is its break out point it will go up higher before it sets up new resistanceRyzen 4000 series CPUs and RDNA2 GPUs being released soon and you think it'll go down?CoolWhy would you sell before console releasesWhy pay taxes playing with $60?I second this. Was beginning to lose faith in AMD.Same held the shit at 53 for so long i gave up and sold. The day I sell it goes up to 56 and a week later 62. Oh amd why do you treat me so bad.Can’t win them all boi.There was a small announcement yesterday about some [New Products](https://www.amd.com/en/press-releases/2020-07-21-amd-ryzen-4000-series-desktop-processors-amd-radeon-graphics-set-to).New chips announcedEarning are coming up next week. People are expecting good things.NoA thread from yesterday had me look into them more yesterday but with this new info, [what the heck. ](https://youtu.be/Pb1eMwm7fS8)That's why I hold both AMD and TSM.would this be a good choice for a noob investor? I'm looking to start I've just browsing / reading for a bit.
>technically my second because I never speak of the first... went to $***

Lol we can all relate. This is the danger of recalling trades and decisions and listening to others. It's their highlight reel![Thanks for your post] (https://youtu.be/bqyLJ-fWbSI)Why sell?I've been holding since August and adding more others seem to day trade itnothing about it is false. i dont think it will get near 50 again, id wait for a decent dip then get in thereAtm 60$ callsActually it was because of OEM chips announcement and partnership with Lenovo and HP.  You really want to call people noobs?Which ?Likewise. I’m going to sell a covered call today and puts tomorrow to play the possible reversal.im holding for that long term gains tax. i do my day trades in options, but im holding AMD for at least a yearI'm in the opposite boat waiting for AMD's minor bubble to burst to $48 dollars.Is AMD good stock for new day traders to try it out. Put in a stop order to sell if it comes down to $61.Waiting for it to drop back to 58ish level and hope to see a nice bounce off that previous resistancesorry buddy. lolTech is tanking after earnings.  I'll buy back on the dip at the end of the month.  IV been swing trading amd for months as well.Over 59,000 in open interest on $50 8/21 puts, it’s going down.  It’s way over its consensus price target, and no over its ATH, with no news or justification to be.It's what tech has been doing after earnings.  Playing the trend.  Also everyone has known the amd roadmap for a while.  These announcements are news to anyonePriced inBecause I buy and sell amd weekly and make bank.Huh?  I took $3k profit.You can buy more then one share.What do you mean broActually the reason is this among other things  
 [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amd-stock-surges-to-5-month-high-after-announcement-of-new-chips-2020-07-22?siteid=yhoof2](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amd-stock-surges-to-5-month-high-after-announcement-of-new-chips-2020-07-22?siteid=yhoof2)Yes and Zen 3, RDNA2, and new consoles all launching later this calendar year. It's getting real!Confused since $AMD always disappoints in last few quarters - earning is exactly as expected and guidance is just OK.Don't get me wrong I still like AMD but this new arm processors concern me a little (I actually have a MacBook pro and wish they'd continue using Intel/Amd)buy high, sell low?As a beginner, you should focus in markets you are already familiar with. When I invested in AMD, they were about to release their next batch of Ryzen CPUs. The first batch fell short compared to Intel's equivalent, but we knew the 2nd batch would give Intel some serious competition - that was my reasoning for investing. 

AMD has been on a steady increase over the years, I don't see much risk in investing small like I did. I certainly wouldn't break the bank over it, but that's just me. They are still 2nd in the GPU space - if one day they manage to exceed expectations with fancier tech, I can see a bump.I think it is a good choice (long time owner here) , but I wouldn't come in just yet. A correction should be on the way and will make for a better opportunity.Yes, I invested very little in that first one and am actually grateful it crumbled - I ended up learning a lot from that experience.Because it won’t go up forever...Loos like a $70 stock with Intel not making progress in chip tech. Market is more interested in future capabilities than current earnings. Every time I try to do some trading it goes pretty bad.

ThanksYou don't get it. Everything I listed is the reason and will continue to be the reason for AMDs success including the partnerships you mentioned. And yes, you're talking about 100% gains on a sure thing. With options it could've been so much more.$57 put that expires 2 weeks from this Friday. If AMD doesn't go back to $57 I see it as a good thing.That's my approach for most things, but I allow myself some fun money to trade with.I was in at 49. If that happens I'll buy some more.I'm not really qualified to give advice on day trading.I'm a new trader and have been day/swing trading AMD as a new trader for last few months to consistent but modest success. pretty much buy at low $50s and sell at $57-$58It might not. Who knows what it’s new low point isOh please explain why you are laughing?I don’t think you understand what a break out isPretty sure there was news... and sorry but I disagree with you. Luckily we will find out but no it’s not going back to 50This wont touch 50 again my friend.Roadmap isn't the play with AMD though. Sales knockout due to lockdown on zen3 chips is the play.I don't get how misinformation gets up voted so commonly on these forums. This is the answer it has nothing to do with earnings in a week lolYessir.I'm not that stupid loloh for sure, I have AMD product and am aware of their competition with Intel. do you recommend any good resources to check out as a beginner?For me yes the consumer GPU market is interesting, but if they can take a large piece of the enterprise/server CPU market from intel that would be huge.If it got to 65 why wouldn't it go higher?

I have been holding it since $10 and if I had your thinking I would have sold it at $20, $30, $40 or $50.Apple never dropped Intel in favor of AMD, they use Intel integrated graphics and procesors and eventually will transition fully to ARM. GPU side, Intel uses AMD discrete GPU they dropped NVDA but they will now dump AMD as well.$50 puts 8/21.  Over 50,000 in open interest on the position.oh same. i try to keep most of my money in stocks but always have plenty of options and cash laying aroundSo you should sell, and then buy them back...Wish more folks in this sub took this approachYa you can always just hope I’m just saying that if I see it do that I’ll hop in I only have investments in indexes and etfs but trade stocks short term."it won't drop below 60"sorry buddy.  Tried to tell ya.But it is, and it will.-3% on the day as you say this...Zen3 chips havnt been on sale during the lockdown...It's reddit. The average redditor is a lazy moron who doesn't read past headlines. Usually harmless elsewhere except here, where listening to them can cost you your own money.their last 3 years are the reason, they are finally being rewardedif you understand that, you should understand this is the worst time you could get in on AMD...I never said Apple dropped Intel for AMD. But that's a huge hit to Intel's future income which reduces their ability to R&D.Literally what I've been doing with AMD, like I said above...It's difficult to transition from the unconcious incompetence phase into concious incompetence. Some never do...I see what you are saying. I hope it doesn’t as I have a long position and just swing trade a half postitionI said it might drop to 58 but it will set up new resistance points above it’s previous ones. You said it would drop to 50.... how’s that working for you?

Edit: just checked sitting at 59... looks like I’ve been dead on.Tried to tell me what? Did AMD hit 50? Or what are you saying?I think I’ll trust a lot of professionals who said it was time to break out over someone like you who didn’t even take the time to find the news that was released yesterdayI know I just bought back in on this dip lol.  You wont see 50 again.Obvious typo is obvious. Zen2.I knowSays Apple dropped Intel for their chips and says he never said that few comments laterYup, exactly. The more you know, the more you realize you don't know.You trying to imply a breakout through resistance would magically make it impossible to fall.Professionals who said that.... 0

Ill start DCAing for the run up to ER.Doesn't seem like it.Their own chips. Their being Apple. This is common sense.Moving the goalposts because you feel foolish for claiming it will drop to 50? How about you just let it play out and if you happen to be right come back and brag. So far all you’ve done is show I’ve been 100% spot on... kinda makes you look foolish. Sorry buddy lolI’ve seen a lot of actual professionals say for a few weeks it was prime to break out. I don’t really care what you think. Have you taken the time to even look up the news yet? I’ve owned this for a long time and am very familiar with it. Maybe you are right and I’ll just keep swing trading a half position and taking my 10-12% every week or 2. It finally broke above 60 then kept running, if you knew anything about stocks you’d now it busted through its resistance point, where it sets back up is anybodies guess but the most likely scenario is higher. You can bet lower but that’s going against the oddsBro lol I sold at 60.55 and pocketed 3k.  Bought back in after the 3 percent dip.  of course youll make money on a put on AMD after it rallies.  Iv been swing trading this for almost 4 months.  Wont see 50 tho.okIV never said it would drop to 50?  Someone else on this thread said that but I even told him no chance.  Not sure why you're making things up now after I proved you wrong lol.Ok so cite your “professionals”...Sorry I thought you were the same guy, I never looked at your name. So why are you laughing at me then? AMD is doing exactly what I said it would. Plus the whole market is tanking and a 3.5% down day is nothing for this stockCNBC.Because you tried to tell me I don't understand what a breakout is and it won't fall below 60 again.  Was just an incredibly ignorant statement to make.  Especially because IV been in amd for years and swing trade it.That’s not a citation...Don’t be stupid like that mcfly guy. Read the next statement of that post. The stock is doing exactly what I said it would do. You had the same argument with mcfly don’t be dumb like him.It’s a place with professionals where you could learn something. Give it a try. Why don’t you just set a reminder and revisit this disagreement? You can call me out if I’m wrong and AMD hits $50 againI know what CNBC is slap nut, I’m telling you to cite your sources saying it’s going to break out.  We both know the reason you fail to do it.Hey is it down to 50 yet?CNBC.You’re apparently missing a chromosome.You always know you’ve won an argument when the person goes to insults especially the “retard” level ones. I don’t think you even understand charts and what a resistance point is...No.  There’s no point in continuing this little back and forth.  You’ve been given actual facts and analysis from Morningstar and MarketBeat, and your contention to that is “Well I’ve heard from professionals...”, but you can’t cite these professionals, or give any specifics, but yet sit here and actually think you’re making a point.From your precious CNBC professionals

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/02/21/amd-could-see-a-35percent-decline-after-massive-run-trader-warns.htmlThat’s from 6 months ago... now I know who I’m arguing with... what a waste of time. I’ll watch my up votes accumulate on this thread, how are yours doing?No worries the dude you're arguing with is retarded. He hates AMD 😂Less transperancy is never good. This will only cause greater divide between those in the "know" (ie. funds/ wall st crowd) and those not (ie. retail investors). The only winners here are funds. Every other investor gets shafted. 

Most funds over $3.5B are investing in large caps. Small cap names will be a total shit show with less transperancy. 

While true that 13F are a quarter old, many funds don't flip in/out of names. They are longer term investors. Retail guys don't rely solely on 13F filings to make a decision, but it does help when you know you have "smart money" backing on an investment. 

Passing this proposed rule will not be good for the mom/pop investors. But when did anyone ever lookout for them anyways?At $250, looks like I would still be under the threshold.As someone strictly playing at home, it's really hard for me to believe the 3.5B+ people don't already have this locked in. 

It's pretty shitty. Is there actually anything we can do?Well in all fairness the number was set 60 years ago. They are simply updating it.Our firm has less than $3.5B in AUM but more than $500M and I can tell you we don't want to report these 13Fs because it's just another regulatory thing that takes time and effort to do. But I don't see how this harms retail investors. If you are buying a stock because it's on Bauposts latest 13F you are in trouble because the report is not current data and you don't know what their investment thesis is so if the stock declines maybe that firm is buying more but maybe that firm is getting out and driving the stock down. What should the retail investor do? Wait 2 months for the next 13F?It's simply too late. The country is just too corrupt at this point.i trade on price action so really i dont carewhy is this not getting more upvotes, upvote people!I believe the word to free you from this skewed economic crony capitalism game is called B-I-T-C-O-I-N.You’re missing the point that it doesn’t change anything, at all. 

Let’s say there’s a fund with 10b invested in TSLA at previous 13f filing, and over the period of this quarter, dumps all of their shares onto the Robinhood gang (like they probably did). You wouldn’t know that until next quarter, after the shares are gone, regardless of if they have a filing requirement or not... 

How does this affect you in any way shape or form? There is also still n ports, which would also report that infoWhat the fuckTrumpWell, they uhhhhh... they halted ZOOM trading because people were mixing it up with ZM! Take that!>Less transperancy is never good.

Please read the [proposed rules and the reasoning](https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2020/34-89290.pdf).  The proposed time will still require reporting from firms that manage 90+% of the dollar value.  However the other 10% who will no longer need to file constitute 89.2% of all current filers.  So the rules are trying to strike a balance.

Nobody ever complained about the firms managing less than $100M not having to file these forms.  Well, how was that number chosen in the first place?  (Page 9):

*Legislative history indicates that the reporting threshold of section 13(f) was designed so that reporting would cover a large proportion of managed assets, while minimizing the number of reporting persons. The $100 million threshold that was adopted thereby limited the burdens of reporting, particularly on smaller managers. The 1975 Amendments Senate Report noted that, at the time of the section’s adoption, approximately 300 persons—holding about 75 percent of the dollar value of all institutional equity security holdings—would be subject to the reporting requirements*

>Most funds over $3.5B are investing in large caps. Small cap names will be a total shit show with less transperancy. 

There are plenty of funds explicitly investing in small caps.

>Passing this proposed rule will not be good for the mom/pop investors

How so?

Let's examine the intended purpose of these forms (page 9):

*The section 13(f) disclosure program had three primary goals. First, to create a central repository of historical and current data about the investment activities of institutional investment managers. Second, to improve the body of factual data available regarding the holdings of institutional investment managers and thus facilitate consideration of the influence and impact of institutional investment managers on the securities markets and the public policy implications of that influence. Third, to increase investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. securities 
markets.*

With the changed rules we still get to see details for 90% of the dollar value.  So I don't really see how this is a big deal.

I think most people getting riled up here probably didn't even know what form 13F was before this post, and probably had never read a single one.  (I'm sure someone will reply, "but I did").

Looks like some eager redditor picked this rule change and decided to make a big deal about it.

Superficial reading of proposed rule changes only create confusion and outrage.  For example, a superficial reading of another rule change, [Good Faith Determinations of Fair Value](https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2020/ic-33845.pdf) can sound like the following:  The board of a fund which was previously required to assess the fair value of the fund's investments (which impacts the fund's NAV), can now delegate that responsibility to the fund adviser.

What? But isn't the fund adviser the one who suggests where to invest the fund's capital?  How can there not be a conflict of interest?  This can only be bad for us retail investors who blindly invest in funds hoping they'll do a good job.  No!!

Well, if you read the actual details, you'll see that there are actually plenty of checks and balances and other regulations and laws governing how this is done, so it isn't actually a big deal.Maybe the retail investor won't be hurt but don't these also serve to provide transparency and keep these money managers accountable?

Wouldn't this just allow these groups to more easily skirt regulations/make money is less-legal manners? Genuine questionThis...

It’s also aggregated data by entity, and there is no requirements on short positions reporting.

If your strategy is to follow long only funds with quarterly 13F, it’s not gonna do that well regardless.Was interesting to look at Michael burry's last few years.   He made some horrible picks500 million dollars in assets and you "don't want to" report things. I never thought of it like that, I guess you shouldn't pay taxes either?It’s not your right to know what other people’s positions are.>With the changed rules we still get to see details for 90% of the dollar value.  So I don't really see how this is a big deal.

Yes, you are correct, we will see 90% of the dollar value. We'll get to see which funds are invested in SPY, AMZN and AAPL. Doesn't provide much value. But this is not the point. 

I still don't understand what the issue is with funds under $3.5B filing 13Fs. It will cost a bit more in compliance and require time to file paperwork. Markets should be transparent. This is what makes the US and SEC the most trustworthy and valuable market. 

Start moving goal posts on transperancy and US markets will lose a level of credibility.The 13Fs do provide some transparency but they don't really add any accountability and would not result a lower chance of skirting regulations. If you are an SEC registered manager you need to adhere to SEC rules. That is true regardless of whether you file a 13F. The SEC conducts surprise audits and conduct more the more money the firm manages which makes sense. Last year we had our surprise audit and since we are very plain vanilla nothing much came of it aside from a comment or two. All managers must also file a form ADV. That's really where the transparency is. On the SEC website there is a "Investment Advisor Public Disclosure" page. On that page you can type in the name of the firm and you can pull up the ADV and ADV part 2. Those documents have everything you would want to know about the firm itself forget what it actually holds in terms of specific stocks. How much money they have under management, fee schedule, conflicts of interest and more disclosures than you'll ever read.

The Bernie Madoff fraud had a significant impact on the way the money management business operates. Prior to that it was common for the manager that invests the money to be able to also hold custody of the assets. Which means company X not only manages your money but it is held in your company X account. That opens up more opportunity for company X to do something nefarious so it is bad practice now. Today the money manager may have discretion over the investments in your account but those actual assets are in an account at Schwab or Fidelity or some other custodian so when the manager buys AMZN, they need to deliver those actual shares to that custodian. So if you were to try to commit some type of fraud the way Madoff did you would need both parties to conduct the fraud.I think if we made taxes optional there would be an awful lot of people not paying taxes. People pay taxes because they don't want to have wage garnishment and possible jail. Would some people pay anyway? Sure. But not most. The people that prepare the 13Fs could be using that time more productively so if it is not required of us we are unlikely to do it so that person can dedicate more time their to the many other compliance related activities she takes care of.Classic example of a strawman argument.Wow - thanks so much for the in depth insight, one of the reasons I like to comment around even when sometimes you get hit hard with the trolls here. So you don't believe this will have any significant impact in the long term?I’m long on MSFT ....time to scoop up some moreI would imagine slow cloud growth could be taken two ways. Less people using it,  or everyone already has it so how could their numbers grow more.The market is extremely complex and earnings reactions are not as simple as beat = good. However, y’all also need to learn to not take after hours activity seriously. It could literally be one guy selling all his shares.

Jesus that after hours drop is just gonna hurt to look at tomorrow morning.Why is the stock dropping if earnings better than expected?It seems like people here are shitting their pants because AH (which is always low volume, and a little random) looks to be about 2 percent lower than where it opened today (though it closed higher). If this is a long term hold for you (and it should be) there is nothing in the report to worry about.Wait so let me get this straight. Microsoft beats earnings and revenue but stock goes down.

Never change dumbasses who are sellingDrop to 150 And I’ll buy 10 more!Is the drop due to the slow down in cloud growth? 59% to 47% is hardly severe, was there any mention of market share?Time for a top up tomorrow if it continues on openThe Azure slowing is concerning but this is still hold.Its dumping hardI've been burned by earnings too many times.

Doesn’t make sense fully but that’s the way the market goes.[deleted]If they beat, why is it down 3% after hours?FComes out 130pst... this was posted 20 min ago. How?Dump this shitHaha. All my  posts here saying that MSFT would dip after earnings were downvoted on r/stocks \- but , guess what  it did not help to prop us the stock .Told ya again people, keep down voting me[deleted]But can you buy after-hours? Or you are going to buy tomorrow?Too expensive to buy now, no?IT budgets have been cut by 7% or more by most companies. I work for a predominant cloud provider and we have been slow AF.  What I'm seeing is IT are buying tech to help them transition to WFH. It ends up being a lot of point solutions like Zoom, Slack, Gong, Twilio etc.  Not many IT teams are going to spend hundred of thousands of dollars on core cloud transformations since they already have something in place i.e switch from Salesforce or Oracle to Microsoft. Most of these point solutions mentioned above aren't nearly the cost of an ERP or CRM solution.Everyone does not already have it. We are soooooooooooo unbelievably far from being 100% cloud infrastructure.Or people are comparing this growth to last quarter which was an anomaly.It's all random don't read into it too much, it's as simple as it's not a meme stock.They said they have 345 million monthly actual azure users, with it growingOr they're competing against the bohemoth that is Amazon Web Services, yet they're still growing..

I'm curious about Azures cloud growth versus AWS. As someone that works in web development, AWS is the standard, and they were established far before the other cloud companies. I think the stat as of 2 years ago is that AWS was 10x larger than the 2 nearest competitors combined. Azure making up that ground is always going to be an uphill battle.I'm thinking less companies/business growth, but also interested in CRM's but that'll be another month. Either way, I'm long MicrosoftIV around earnings is always funky. Maybe wait a week.It fell 2% or 4 a share not big deal[deleted]How did you buy AH?This the main reason I stopped playing earnings. MFer can take a big chunk of your money. Saw my $5k go down the drain in NFLX callsTrue 😩Theta gang just took a lot of people’s moneyBecause everyone was expecting earnings to be better than expectedProbably guidance.Because AH trading is absolutely meaninglessone reason will be less than expected cloud/azure growth.....it grew more than 50% in previous quarters and it didn't this past quarterJust gives you more time to get in. MSFT is a solid stock long term.It’s overbought rn. Also just give it a couple days.Is this your first time seeing this?It is very common.   It fits with buy on rumor and sell the news.I’m buying up their mistakes!This is how market works against "analyst expectation". There are three numbers involved: 

1. expected number for the media and public
2. expected number traders talk to each other when they are in office
3. expected number traders secretly think it should be, and this is the number they are carefully weighing so they can make a successful bet against other traders.“Tanks” it’s still up 5% for the month and 20% for 3 month.That’s too simple a way to look at it, growth stocks tend to get overbought, if the story the earnings tell do not totally align with the price performance, then the market will correct the price.Won't happen.  Why do people unrealistically hope for things like this?  Microsoft is no longer a company that solely relies on OEM licensing, they've position themselves for the future, they look towards  innovation and emerging markets.  
 Honestly one of the most respectable companies out there, along with being safe based on their diversification and investments into future markets. 

You can get 150 when I execute my calls for AugustYea I’m guessing, besides that it was a good earnings. Lack of cloud growth could either be just growth slowing or weak market.

MSFT is still a good buy imo.Rookie question: what’s a Top Up?So hard. God dam that 2.5%OMG the price is back to where it was on Monday! The horror!A few percentage points is noise, not "dumping hard" a lot of this subreddit's users are in for a real rude awakening when a real drop comes along.EasyWas there any doubt Microsoft wouldn't beat expectations?

Imo the reason why it's down is people expected this, so buy on rumor sell on news as it goes.


Its also why with companies like fastly and ZScaler going into GOD mode after a good earnings, people didn't expect it whatsoever. In fact, it was far more likely they'd do significantly worse“Not making sense’’ best describes the market over the last year anyway.If you're holding long term msft +- couple dollars doesn't really matter.Too many idiots selling the shit out of itIt’s been the pattern for everything beside airlines. Airlines obviously miss hard but went up.Yeah I don’t understandcuz dummies wanna hop on the rocket but that shit goneWhy would you sell??? You should be buying moreMSFT goes down faster than my posts are downvoted )).Not really.3% is a "freefall"?Honestly when it dipped at 205 i kind of wish I had privileges to buy. 

They beat earnings on a weak market and are doing all the right things to set themselves up for the next decade.Yes you can depending on the broker.I did. Already 2% upI don't think you canNice to see a person who knows what he is doing. A little more knowledge to cloud business than  
"Microsoft, Azure, Yay!"I read yesterday that AWS hosts 35% of websites, and Azure hosts 18%. Azure is catching up.I work in tech recruiting at a ~1,500 employee size software company. Microsoft shop from a tech perspective. I’d say Nadella has done a remarkable job and really invested in Azure. The resources and partnership that Microsoft provides engineering companies that use their services has really improved. They’re invested in making sure we know how to really use their products (Azure mostly) I think they’ll catch up to AWS over time but Amazon has a head start.Funny you say that but when it was in the context of the tech being downlast week. People kept saying it was a big deal how 4-5 change. But now it's not a big dealbecause the stock grew 30% and the earnings only 13%. .. may be?People don't like Bill Gates tracking chip idea.If your brokerage supports it, you usually just have to agree to a disclaimer and enable it.LIMIT order. Set to trigger EXT.Td ameritrade lets you buy after hours and premarket.As far as I know there is no way to trade on the exchange AH. I understood the comment to mean they got the trade in before the bell?Playing earnings is ALL about playing the run UP TO earnings. You buy 2 weeks before if you think the sentiment is good, and you sell right before. 

Especially with options, because even when companies pop on earnings, often they fall back down by open next day.

I've been doing this with stock I own recently if it pops on earnings I sell at the top AH and buy back in in the morning. Did this with IBM monday and took a nice 7$ per share profit. Of course you run the risk of it just continuously going up.

Was gonna do the same with MSFT if it popped but looks like I'll be DCAing instead. Now to buy now or in the morning is the question.I bought long so I still have a few weeks til exp. Ole Clippy still might come through for me.This is really the best way to Play msft.   Buy 100 shares and sell naked weekly calls OTM with a .20 Delta.   Msft is a beast but it doesnt pop fast to challenge your theta positionsCan someone explain this?  I feel like people say “theta gang” just to look cool.  I know what theta is, but how does it even apply to this situation?Lmao THEY WEREIt was lolThat’s trueSo it was expected.Do you mind explaining what that means when you say guidance? Sorry for the newbie question!Gotta sell day of earnings Bros. I bought a call that ended this week last week but sold MondayWell the trader talk insiders should be fucking arrested for insider knowledgeWhat are your calls for august?It means he's going to buy moreYou could make a fortune buying a dip on msft every time it drops.Monday was lower. Started at 202 or somethinBasically 😂I have puts and it’s been a good trade so farFor the weakest of weak hands i guessDon't forget Nadella is a freaking beast!Td Ameritrade lets you buy and sell after hours.On the flip side, Microsoft has a huge advantage long term with enterprise software because Teams has such awesome integrations with Office. So while adoption may be slowing against smaller players now, they still have a competitive advantage long term and the best product.Eyyy fellow tech recruiter at a ~1200 tech company as well, also azure and Microsoft dominant. Cya out there champThey're only down for Apple chips.Ok crazyYou can trade after hours. Just bought some more myself. I’ll buy more tomorrow if it dips further.I did that with nvidia last quarter. It shot up a few weeks later. *sad trumpet noise *Naked calls is when you don’t own the stock. If you bought it before hand they’re called covered callsYeah this is a slow and steady bullish stock, perfect for 20 delta CCsWell we don’t really say it to look cool, it’s the truth. When a person in “theta gang” says it, it’s because someone just got their money taken from an individual who sold them the option. If you understand theta you will understand why “theta gang” is a thing. The person who bought the option was sold the option it didn’t just appear on the screen for someone to buy. And the more it goes down the more money the “theta gang” gets to keep. At the end of the day more options expire worthless and all that money you lost holding on to that option went to “theta gang”Yeah that's my point, the earnings beat was priced inThere’s more under the hood than the top line number. In this case a couple of their divisions showed some weakness in future sales, as I read it. But honestly most all tech stocks have run way up. They’d have to blow out the quarter and guide higher to impress long term investors.As part of the earnings report, most companies include what they see happening in the next quarter and next year. If they think there are headwinds that the market didn't foresee, that can cause a stock to drop, even when the company beats on all the top line numbersWhat do they know that we don’t? He didn’t mention they were insider trading, only talking amongst each other.212, let's see what happens. Although I should've played it safer and rolled it further backThat makes no sense for a company like Microsoft after they just beat earningsand so Fidelity. It depends on the brokerage firm and you need to talk to themThat and Azure has great integration with domain controllers.It is great as a document mangler.  I'm used to having to feed my documents into notepad to mangle the formatting, but Teams does it far better.What if you're coworkers?With cinnamon.How do you buy after hoursThrough broker or what?I will look into this. You learn something new everyday!!It never dipped? I quickly buy back in after the initial dip. Just take a few bucks a share profit and get back in.Yes sorry.   Im used to selling spreads so I automatically referred to naked by default.That..... doesn’t make any sense.  The option literally is on the screen for you to buy.  Theta is time decay, if a stock value goes down, that’s not a theta play, that’s a delta play.This and guidanceAhh okay I see, thanksCollusion between market makers is still illegalThat’s a good call imo. I just bought at 200 and hopping for more then 212 in august. GL my friend.Well, the stock is taking a dip in after hours.And Schwabthat would be dopeYou might have to enable it first with your brokerage.

It's also probably a paid ad by Swiss bank UBS.I read this wrong the first time.So they borrowed money to buy at the dip and are now getting ready to sell at the peak, aaand they decided to tell Reuters about it 🤔And RAPO is their name-o! 🎶Who wouldn't pull out right now?My favorite porn...Also in German media it sounds like the crash is about to happen.

this is a bullshit article.Sucks if your on the wrong side of the tradeNot sure what's wrong here? You're moaning they're making money - but I assume you're in stocks to do the same.Your whining about people making money, that's what we're all in the market to do.

edited out insultsSmart, honestly they could have made 40% return in 4 months which would be hundreds of millions if not billions. There are still risks with market due to shaky economy so they can just wait at the sidelines and live cozy life with that money. If shit gets worse they will do it all again nothing to lose for them except unlucky people caught up in the market at the wrong time.This really doesn’t mean shit. It’s like a drop of rain in the ocean. 

Almost $300 Billion trades through the Nasdaq and NYSE daily. They don’t have enough money for their trades to mean anything to you.They’re not assholes, they didn’t make the rulesthey are rich assholes because they are trading intelligently? 

long term investment is really overrated and it's going to burn a lot of people who will be waiting for their investments to recoup losses for decadeswell thats captitalism for youAfter they do, the Robinhood investors will quickly too. Then the headline will blame themAre there billionaires, that are not rich?But you said you loved meI dont think they know about second crashThis. There is zero reason for wealth managers to tell you what they are actually going to do.This has basically been the game plan for decades.  They know they can lower or crash the market if enough pull their money out.  Then they just buy back in when all the retail investors have sold out of fear.  They're just taking your shares off your hands, and you're giving them a discount to do it.

Anyone with enough brains will instead thank them for making your favorite stocks cheaper and for giving you a discount to buy them.  Use their manipulation against them.This shi right here☝️, this shi right here,I honestly find it hard to trust any of these articles.They put their money in real estateGiggity.NiceI think it may have been intentional.“But enough about Kim Kardashian’s latest video....”I don't know what is so surprising.

Don't consider the money you've already lost. That's the biggest mistake people make. Only tomorrow matters; yesterday's gone.Your dad bought stable boomer stocks.. 
dude all those companies were good before covid... let me guess you’ve probs got some national grid, bit of shell? Lloyds probably? 
All were dividend paying stocks before crash just leave them they will come back..Sounds like disconnecting your father's account was a good ideal.Don't sell now, we are in a covid madness, just wait it will go back up.

But if he bought stocks like Hertz you are done.What does your portfolio actually look like as in what stocks did he invsst in?Jesus dude. That’s rough!I'm by no means an expert. But if you look at stocks in your portfolio and ask yourself "would I buy this stock today" and the answer is no, then why would you keep it? 
Sunken cost fallacy and all that. 

A bit off topic: 
Im sorry you don't speak to your father anymore. If it is only due to poor portfolio management, I hope you will reconnect, only with healthier (adult) boundaries (no mixing finances for sure). He might just have done what he thought was best for you. 
My father in law did the opposite, lost a lot of money, asked my wife to take over his account, she bought a lot of Apple, and after 6 month and a large rise she went back to check and he had in the mean time he had changed his mind, sold them and managed to throw away 30% of his portfolio to shit. Lesson learned - even when you do good there is no winning while trying to help :)Also dont worry about it too much if you are 22.    You will gain or lose more than that in your portfolio in a month in 25 years.   Just follow your gut and focus on your career progression.I feel like since you're 22, you should be investing in more risky stock. Dividends are great and all, but you have time to try something that has huge upside. 

Not to say you shouldn't have a good chunk of dividend stocks, bonds, and other low risk investments, but you should have a high risk tolerance because you are young.It’s not a loss until you sell. There’s no reason to believe a stock like BP won’t return to precoronavirus prices. The question is, do you think you can earn more using that money elsewhere in that same period of time?If they remain at a loss, when you do sell them it will count as a tax writeoff (essentially, its reducing your income in the year when you sell them), keep that in mind when determining when to sell (the higher your tax rate for the year the more this deduction is worth)I’d sell so you can you realize all the losses and write them off. Then I’d take that money and buy stocks that are ready to perform now. It’s getting really old hearing people talking about buying stocks that performed “really well before Covid.” Who gives a rip how they performed before Covid. Covid is here and it’s here for at least another 4-5 months, if not longer. Just as well jump on board something that can withstand the pressures in the short term. If or when a vaccine is produced, then jump in stocks that were successful pre-Covid.Can you bottom line the question without the part about your dad losing your money? It's kind of distracting the point / question.

Are you asking whether you should sell all of your stock and index funds and put it into cash? Or is there a different question?Never trust family with your money.. whether is managing portfolio, loans, doing business together, etc 

Those 2 things should remain separated but good luck OP!Probably a question best for r/legal advice, but I don't think there is anything you can do. You allowed your dad to have access to the account and what's done is done. 

The only thing I can suggest is to just sell (even at a loss, if necessary) the positions that you don't like and put that money where it will do the most good.

Sorry, man. That's rough.

One word of personal advice:  I don't know you or your dad, and there is probably a lot more going on than just this. But, don't let this ruin your relationship with your dad.  Family is forever, so work on that, if possible.Dude, sorry about this. *Always* control your own investment account. You dad probably meant well, but it's best to look forward now. These stocks *could* return to previous highs when a vaccine is available, but there are no guarantees there. You will have to take a judgement call on whether to wait for them to recover or sell them.I don't understand how an 18 year old can even have 17 grand to lose. I was but a poor little boy at that age!Sell the stock. Take the tax write off. Invest in what you want. Take your father to court for mishandling your money (kidding)If it was me I would take the losses cash out and move those funds immediately to something I’m more familiar with 

You win or you learnJust sell them and buy the indices. Screwing around wont do you any favors. Idk why people are stuck on holding oil companies here. The best piece of advice I ever got trading is "just get it over with".If you feel like now is the time to lock in some profit, then look at setting a stop loss order or sell some stock and move that money into a stable bond ETF.  The market is at a new high, Covid is still an issue, and there is an election coming up.  So there is volatility on the horizon and an instinct to start trading cautiously is not a bad thing right now.Would personally advise to aggressively average down on these positions and sell out as soon as you break even. 

Rule #1: never lose money.I'd sell today and move on. These stocks may never recapture their highs or where you bought them at. Especially BP - who knows when we will see expensive oil prices again. You're 22, you can afford to take the loss. I wouldn't sit on these stocks for years waiting for them to come back. Look at people who bought Exxon in 2011... 9 years and the stock is worth half what it was.Of course you should cut your losses and invest in companies with a brighter future, you'll make your loss back in no time. I'm from belgium and my dad also "invests" in shit companies solely from belgium. He missed out on >10k by ignoring my advice on reforming his (relatively small and shy) portfolio (~30k).Ye. Agree w the previous comments: boomer stable stocks. Wait post-Covid, they’ll likely recover by then. Sell them and specialize in what you knowMoney comes and goes mate. Mend your relationship with your dad. I doubt he had bad intentions. Would hate for you to regret having ruined your relationship with your dad over some poor investment choices.You only get one dad. Someday you may be willing to pay all that $17k and some to buy more time with your dad. Unless there’s more to the story I’d say what your dad did was inappropriate but not worth losing a relationship over. 

You got control of your account, now rebalance your portfolio how you see fit, and try to forgive him.Don't hold investments you don't like, sell it all and ask your father for compensation of any losses.Question for you. Do you dabble in options? more specifically Vertical spreads? (and just general option speculation)Hey there. I pretty much go after things that are needed, have something tangible, or low risk.

I personally like REITS and also being in the IT field i try to combine the two when possible. I am long on CONE (datacenter reit), CCI(cell tower reit), AMT(cell tower reit, international). Two other good stocks i like are msft and panw.Sorry to hear it affected the relationship. While you need to change the portfolio to match your risk appetite and domain knowledge, options are to do this with a sell and buy, or to sell covered calls on shares you do not want to hold (in or close to the money to improve the odds of execution) and to also sell puts around the same time frame that are likely to result in shares you want being assigned to you.

Timing the market is not practical but you may be able get a bit more on the sales and buy in at a bit less.I don't understand why you would keep them, invest in the stocks you think will perform the best.Buy some ARKK / ARKW

Love me some ARKDude, go dip your balls in polish until they are brass again.

If it’s oil and gas, that’s a recession prefect pick, and the only problems are temporary and artificial.  They will go up and pay a doc in the meantime, since they are massive commodity producers who want to keep investors on board.

Take the time to learn the sector, and at the pace of your shares returning to their buy value. Don’t lose money you didn’t even know you were losing until recently, because you can make it back; unless you’re going to swing trade, the money is parked in prettt safe bets in the future.  I don’t know what “Lloyd’s is”, as I’m not British, and I don’t know anything about financials. That’s one someone in financials can specifically answe for you, and since you have time to save your wealth, ask someone who knows about o&g.  Ask experts in those sectors, because most experts can’t wait to talk about their value (what they are experts on)

Good luck bro from the other sideIt's not a loss till you sell. I'm still holding BP.

Honestly it's kind of on you for giving him access and not checking. Like I get emails on every transaction, so it's pushed to me, not something I have to check.Your dad might be the worst investor ever.Step one leave the UK

Step two move to the USA

Step three trade on the real marketThis is exactly what I was looking for, I think being both still Young and never having seen such losses before definetly got a bit flustered.

Nice to have cooler and more objective heads giving advice, thanks!The good old Sunk Cost Fallacy. :)That last part basically true with life in general, what's happened has happened, can only go forward in time.These are good words. "Yesterday is gone." I feel as though I've heard these words over the years but it just hit a little different this time.  Many thanks.Lol can confirm my boomer dad loves these kind of stocks, Lloyds was the first stock he told me to buy, "yeah but it pays great dividends" is something I heard a lotLet me say it one more time for the people in the back...

#COMPANIES PAY DIVIDENDS TO COMPENSATE FOR LACKLUSTER GROWTH! 

If you see a high dividend company, it’s paying that out to encourage investors to buy shares of the company instead of SPY because the company’s shares won’t appreciate at a rate that matches the growth of index funds.GEMainly BP, Imperial Brand, Shell.etc

Very small allocation to Index fund which really was annoying considering that was my main portion I wanted to invest in while I developed my own investment ideology.Also, OP, are you sure, ABSOLUTELY sure, that your “father” isn’t a figment of your imagination your brain has used to explain awful, awful investments you made? I suppose I’m asking the wrong person...Thanks for the advice and the kind words.

Unfortunately the communicating with my dad was cut off due to personal non-money related issues.

Definetly agreed on being financially individual, I'd much rather deal with my own mistakes then let others make them for me and as a result have no learning experience!So sell low buy highDuly noted, the context may not be important just the situation.

Im looking to reinvest into stocks and Index funds again as I luckily have a sufficient amount of cash savings to not hit me too hardStarted working at 16 and regularly put money in for about 4 years.

Also inherited 8k when My granddad diedThanks, think that the losses have taken me so off-guard that I was paralysed by the shock and wasnt acting as my gut told me to!I got out of my index fund to invest in Ark and REIT’sOil and gas is a shit investment are you stupid?He can always buy US stocks from the UK. But the exchange rates and high commission will be annoying.I think it's bad that your father invested your money since losses can have an impact on your relationship. However, what he did is fundamentally not bad, he put money in what he thought would bring consistent value over the year. I saw a lot of "boomer" stock (high-dividend and boring sector) getting hammered with the recent crash while tech stock had a fantastic recovery. You have to evaluate the fact that tech stock are much different (high PE and low dividend + service oriented/rapid growth) at the risk of higher volatility (high competition, risky investment, disruptive business model). AMD is trading at a stunning PE of 100 which means that for every $ per share it makes, the share is valued 100 times that. AT&T has a dividend of 6.88% and PE of 15 as of now. Which stock is better? Well AMD is obviously valued very high so if it fails to grow as fast as it is anticipated (high PE), it'll risk to settle down to a lower PE. Intel's PE is 13 so AMD stock price (for equivalent PE) would be 5.59$ (considering earning per share of 0.43$). Right now, it's trading around 57$! NVDIA who is also a direct competitor of AMD has a PE of 63. AMD at this PE would be trading around 27$. NVDIA is the king of AI. What is AMD the king of? Budget GPU? Better CPU? That won't bring much but it's well positioned to tackle both Intel and NVDIA (server, gaming console, AI - one day, etc). So while AMD valuation has skyrocketed while your sad portfolio's value plummeted, there's a lot of chance your portfolio will perform much better than a stock that grew too fast in the long run (10+ years). Personally, I don't like high-divident stocks as I prefer a company that invest its money into growing and maintaining its workers happy instead of feeding hungry boomer investors.Sunk Cost fallacy doesn't apply when the market fallout was driven entirely by economic factors.

Exceptions to that rule are there, but they are just that. Exceptions.Oh man join the club. Everytime My dad was like "im buying more vodafone" (I had no idea of the scale) It was always eitheir some spiel about them branching to India or the classic "dividend is good"Oh dear not Lloyd’s........Some companies are pretty much down growing. What kind of innovation you want to see from coke and Pepsi?While I wholeheartedly agree with your statement, I still dabble with high dividend yielding companies for semi-short term gains. I personally find them low risk but maybe I've just been lucky in the past. 

And by dabble I'm talking less than 5% of my portfolio. I revently bought 750 shares of SUN (split purchases in Sep 19 and Mar). I think I've taken in around $1000 in dividends and my shares are up 17% (amidst the Age of COVID). Now they haven't had cash flow issues in the last few years but to add on to your statement, I'm not really seeing any growth. So for me it's just a matter of cash flow monitoring and pacing the f out when the payouts appear to be unsustainable.You say thi: without realising the utility of dividend stocks... really a lack of empathy on your part.. perhaps you didn’t intentionally but it came across as arrogant...
Imagine you’re 65 retired you want a bit of kick for your money bank interest is what? (I don’t know exactly) .8% fixed one year? Not gonna get you a holiday in Greece is it? 
Getting corporate bonds and etfs in the U.K. if you don’t know what you are doing is quite hard.. corp bonds have a minimum of 50k for some..
Buying divi stocks has been stable income for people retiring who can’t take the risk that younger people can...
Gettin a 4% yield nearly guaranteed in your golden years and having some money to pass on is pretty damn good...

OPs dad was merely trying to protect his capital.. and get some “safe income” if you look at your stocks op and add divis I bet you aren’t down 17k..
It’s just a boomer move...
Anyway nothing wrong with dividend plays it just depend where you are in life...

I have loads of divi stocks because my grandad died with them it’s not much and they just give me a few hundred quid extra a year.I too fell for the GE "muh dividends" trick.Honestly these are petroleum companies and while they may be suffering losses now, they will soon bounce back once covid clears up and you should be good to sell them then :)Sounds like it's mostly oil and gas.  I wouldn't sell until it swings back up to pre covid levels.  Oil and gas isnt going anywhere.What are your positions for BP & RDS if you don't mind me asking?I think they're probably sound, oil will come back around pretty soon. I think BP shed it's North Sea assets to Premier Oil which was a sound move because I think the price of oil is going to be less dictated by OPEC going forward, and thus going to be cheaper. That'll undermine high-cost oil extraction (like the North Sea). So BP might actually be a good one to keep. They're generally retiree favourites, who tend to be conservative investors and the crash will have burnt them a lot so it'll take awhile for the value of those shares to creep back up.If you wanted to invest in index funds then why didn’t you just do it yourself? Why have him do it in the first place?I wish I could make this stuff up, I have had some duds before but at least they were consensual duds hahaOP, what broker do you use in the UK? I didn't think Vanguards were available there.You’re missing the point. So what if you sell low. It doesn’t matter. What will make you more money in the next few months? Holding stocks that are negatively affected by corona or taking the money tied up on them and putting it into companies that will do better short term?I would listen to what this guy says in his blog. It's all you really need to know, but it sounds like your intuition at 18 was fine.

Consumer, utility, and energy are recession good buys. Least that what the idiots at fidelity say.Lol! Vodafone is nearing to packing up its business from india. The indian listing Vodafone Idea has steadily declined for the last 5 years from over a 100 Rupees per share (1.2$/share) to trending to now at around 8 Rupees a share (11cents a share)He advised me to buy it as it was a solid bank and obviously muh good dividends. My first ever stock buy was £50 of lloyds, which I paid a £12 transaction fee on (Hargreaves lansdown man) hahaha. Pretty sure it’s been going down ever since 

I was young, I consider it £60 well spent because I learnt a lot of lessons since then lola pepsi enema would be nice>Oil and gas isnt going anywhere. 

For now. I wouldn't plan on investing in those companies with the plan on giving my kids (if I had any) an inheritance from them. For short to medium term, and I suppose long term (just not very long term), they can be viable investments. I'm similar to OP in that I work in tech, so that's what I know and feel most comfortable with.Are you really sure?I use Hargreaves if that helps at allI swear Lloyd’s, Vodafone and Royal Mail is probably a combo many of us had at the startIf it takes the rust off spark plugs, imagine what it can do for your colonO I agree in the next 10 years I'd probably sell them. But no way would I sell them now at a loss and invest in tech while they are at their current evaluations.  I also dont like the sentiment that OP thinks his dad tried to screw him.  Oil stocks generally have a 7 to 10 percent dividend plus growth. I mean ya their boring but I'm sure they beat the 7 percent growth average that people strive for every year.who cares manLubrication + Pepsi + Vacation

TSLA was hated by most this sub back when it was cheap in the $200's and $300's.

NIO was barely ever even discussed back when it was $3 or less. It's only after it's soared to over $10 a share that people started talking about it.

NKLA was already insanely overpriced at over $40 a share by the time a bunch of people started talking about it here.Visa is a meme stock?You missed AMD, this sub loves some AMD babyLiterally have half of these.

Your list was pretty spot on.the word you're looking for is 'they'Indeedy.I've been holding MSFT since 2004, I bought 125 shares at just under $30.  I've had it DRIP since 2011.  I'm up 480% overall.  The best of my initial purchases is up 645%.that would be 13% gain, very safe and promising with good growth rate. cant losePlease buy the dip. 

Buy the dip 
Save my call spread.I keep telling people **MICROSOFT IS THE GREATEST COMPANY IN THE WORLD**. If I had to YOLO my life savings on one stock for the next 30 years it would be MSFT. The diversification of revenue, the management, the importance of AI and cloud mean MSFT will be the greatest investment in big cap tech over the next 50 years. Short at your peril, because MSFT will outperform all of big cap tech, AMZ may get close but the others aint got a chance.Can't agree with you more.Well, I wouldn't mind but I could go for a bit of a pullback to load in 10 more shares first.Microsoft is always a buy.Arrived a little late to the party. Started building a position a couple weeks ago. Yesterday hurt but I bought a little more on the dip and have a $205 average. Long hold for me so if it drops more I’ll buy more.When everyone says buy....Great company but I feel like there will be better buying opportunities down the road. I don’t think a 13% increase in profits justifies a 50% increase in share price.I bought some yesterdayJumped out of Apple to hop into MicrosoftBought a bunch today.BUY BUY BUY!!Msft is one of the largest holdings in my portfolio. This company is in numerous different industries and still highly favored amongst institutions that utilize their products and services.. I'm always adding more and more shares of this stockI bought 205c for October. It looked like to be about the most sure thing available. No way these things don’t print.If we're talking long-term, don't forget also that MSFT actually pays dividends, unlike some of the other tech big boys.  Building an income stream can be a huge difference if you're truly looking long-term.>The growth drivers remain strong. 

One worrisome item was that Azure, their prime growth sector, lagged last quarter in terms of growth.

>And the valuation on MSFT stock remains tangible relative to the company’s long-term growth prospects. 

Depends on your valuation method. Mine has them at a fair value of ~177 with a 10% margin of safety. Doesn't mean that's "right", but it's what I tend to use. I have a position in MSFT and added a bit today at 198, so I'm willing to bend my rules sometimes, but I wouldn't say it's clear cut that their trading at fair value right now.

>No way this does not hit $230 in the next few months.

Never be that confident.I was all set to buy 5K at $200...but then Intel shares dropped 15%. Couldn't turn down that bargain.Bought some as well i think xbox series x launch will be better than xbox one and everything else everyone said might buy some more monday or TuesdayAlready got a lotVery confident with Msft!  When they dip I never worry. Holding 100 sharesIt made less profit than last year and guidance was lower than expected. We are in a pandemic and much uncertainty. Why would there not be a sell-off? It is a great company, but a year ago it was trading at 130-140. I would expect it to pull back more, especially given the focus on many negative factors now creeping back into news headlines. Also, amzn and aapl earnings may swing another sell-off. This last quarter will probably be their strongest for a while. Again, I love msft and I would buy the dip if the dip actually happened. It dropped 5%, i'll wait for 20-25.One of the first stocks I bought when I was able to do so myself. So many things, and I don't get the hit from the earning call. (I do but don't think it's warranted.) I see the decline in cloud from the closure of so many businesses and the new barrier owners must hurdle getting a company going in this economy. But the fact azure FOR THE 1ST TIME grew sub 50% and they still blew past expectations shows a wide most that still supports the business. I see 250$ by year end. I'm long MSFT thoughI lost today about -$850 on MSFT credit spreads as market went down. I agree it’s a good opportunity to buy low but no more funds left for that.What About Slack making allegations towards Microsoft for illegal activities, Going under an EU review? This will probably make me sound dumb, I’m a beginner and have been trying to learn as I go but I still do not fully understand MSFT and why it’s at the price it is given everything everyone says about it.Someone said 230 in coming fee months.
I say 230 in next 15 days.
Market will go up by any good newsDefinitely. Microsoft is a good company. Watch this!

If anyone wanna wager who get better return in 10 years, let me know.What a patience you haveYour pull out game is strongWould you suggest using this stock as a place to put money temporarily? Kind of like a second savings account?Just goes to show how important leadership is. Microsoft was pretty irrelevant under Balmer for most of 2000s up until Satya came in an shook things up by deciding to focus on cloud.

Kinda see the same thing happening with Intel now only in reverse. 

The problem with owning a single stock for 30 years is that you never know which way company culture will go long-term. Things might seem good now but might not be in the future. That's why diversification is always bestWhat you're saying is essentially cheerleading. But all that is subject to change, so check your emotions when you invest. 

(Not saying you're wrong...)You should never YOLO your savings on one stock, even if it is MSFT. 

But I agree, MSFT is the king of stocks going forward.It’s not just a single company too. It’s pretty much 100s if companies that’s diversified in many sectors of tech. AMZN is cool too, but threat of anti-trust is much largerI have my entire Roth in MSFT.Microsoft charges so damn much for their corporate software licenses, and it’s getting worse. All it takes is a shift in software (Word, Excel, etc) in the future with a new generation of younger people that support open-source options, and Microsoft becomes non-existent.Not as good as $AMZN Amazon is every where where msft is in cloud where msft is not everywhere amzn is - self driving car, robots, retail, delivery supply chain and logistics 

$Amzn is far superiorIdk if you guys are bots or not. 

Apple has gone up ~60% since March, Tesla has gone up ~399% since March.

Microsoft has only gone up ~47%

To me Microsoft sure as hell is definitely not the best company to invest your life savings in if you actually want to make money.It was down to $197 earlier today. Just out of curiosity, what PT do you have as a buy-in price?You risk missing out on a run to save potentially $10-30?Agreed but is this place represents everyone ?according to stockrover msft margin of safety is 28% and a fair value of $271, which doesn't seem that bad?Down the road... When exactly? When coronavirus is no longer a thing after the US election?I just saw this posted, unsure about the veracity.  But makes me wonder if it matters which you pick.

https://imgur.com/0mAtNuD

Edit my bad, I misread it. Doesn’t apply at all to Apple.no way?

Only if the market keeps rallying.Love to know your valuation method that has them at 177... somethings wrong with it. Do you take into account an inflated market? Surely if your valuation on Microsoft is that low it’s low on all stocks like itYou seem like you know what you’re talking about. What else you holding?

Edit; what made you break rules for msft?Azure lagged because of the global depression we are in, without corona it would be growing 55%+Yeah... If the whole market moves, who knows where the bottom is. Broad market forces are powerful pricing mechanisms. 

But, that’s why dollar cost averaging is a beautiful thing. If the market goes down, just buy more. 

I’m about 25% cash right now. May pick up some MSFT on Monday, especially if it dips any more.Margin.Long term does not matter, companies make allegations all the time.What's a slack lol? I don't even know what they do or why they even exist when I can utilize msft teams for whatever reason slack thinks it can outperform msft atI'm with you.  This time last year the stock was $140 when everything was sunshine and kittens.  Now the world starts to end and its $200?why to 140? Can you explain please?Lmao the fuck at the last sentence. It’s a long term solid investment everyone here is saying thatI’m sure people up 2 million in one year comment on this sub. First thing they doBuying both.It's sitting in my IRA so...long term investing is kingif you have a savings account i suggest you close it and put all your money somewhere else. savings accounts are scams, they wouldnt even cover inflation of your money. I think i had one and i needed to put 500 bucks a month for 0.015 % return...  


Super safe money holding would to put your money into a EFT portfolio. get one thats not activley watched by someone (forget the term) but you pay money to have some on monitor it but its been proven unactive ones do better and are cheaper) tons of stocks and if one tanks you dont feel it. if the entire market tanks everyone is screwed anyways so you just wait for it to recover... buy more on the crash dont touch for 30 years.

Microsoft IMO is great short, great long. you're not going to see a leading company like Microsoft instantly go bankrupt. Short term would be good since back to school will most likely be online Microsoft will push sales on pc and programs. also Xbox 5 coming up for christmas.It is about as close to a safe haven as you can getWell we have satya for 10 years and I hope he appoints someone competent, so we have a solid 20 years for sure. After that, I don't know.I think balmer used to sell calls at 40$Yes exactly, see boeing.50% JNJ, 50% MSFT. Sprinkle dividends into SPAQ.Yep no one was saying Microsoft was the greatest company in the world between 2002-2012. Now all of a sudden everyone thinks they are amazing yet they seem to forget that lost decade and how the Microsoft stock just plateaued that entire time.You forgot TSLA. I even sold my kids to buy more. Who needs them? I can just make more, right?The problem with changing software is it's super fucking sticky. Once you build on it unraveling is near impossible. So you're stuck with what you got. Especially when your talking about base infastructure like ERP or CRM.People have said that since 1985.  Microsoft built everything off DOS.  It still lays underneath almost every computer system on Earth.  People and business use them, not because they are always the best, but that's what everybody else uses so you can only swim upstream so long before you just go with the tide.This will never happen. As somebody who works in this industry the costs to try and move Away from Microsoft are staggering. People don’t like change, people do not want to use a different office suite, AD DS are unbeatable.. I could carry on but I’m half asleep.Google docs?You got downvoted for not joining the pump. I'm off the cloud and content with open source, like many others who can't see the appeal in the ransomware user agreement that is Microsoft cloud.Talks of life savings, only looks back 4 months.

LOL.lolIdk if you are a troll or not.Tesla is a bubble, the other two are not.🤨Then in your opinion what’s the best company to invest in? TSLA?>since March

You.. do know what happened in March.. yes.?Only cuz the robinhoods know what apple and Tesla are.I likely got my starter position at 200 something based off what happened during the opening few minutes.

I'd prefer at least 180 really to lump sum, but I'm looking to add 10 more shares to have 20 for more exposure to the cloud for me.No it's the most elite of retail traders who know what the other minnows don'tI just got off a ten hour shift, hospital is about 25% covid patients still and I'm not even in a hotspot (Indiana), I don't see this fully gone by November, but I'm not an immunologist. I'm so tired of randoms trying to talk about how covid in US is no big deal when I see these patients every God damn day and so many of them are in such shit shape. Really doesn't help me have a positive outlook for our country as a whole that so many people can so easily convince themself that because something isn't directly affecting them then it must be all bullshit. Sorry for the rant, just weary after almost five months of this.Once the financials start catching up to the share price. It’s currently at 11x sales which I feel is very high for a company as big as Microsoft. Could be a year from now, could be 3 years from now, could be never. I get that it’s a fantastic company but historically all of its valuation metrics are higher than ever. At its current market cap it’s not a stock that’s gonna grow 15%+ indefinitely so I’m okay with putting my money in other places until there’s a better opportunity.the graphs are certainly similar but it does matter which you pick,
amzn up and down swings are from a quick check I've just done a higher %. 
so assuming they both go up, amzn should give you a higher return.Stimulus being announced this week and likely more vaccine news. I feel pretty confident.It's a pretty simple DCF. Getting the assumptions about growth right is the tricky bit. 

 Like you said, doesn't provide much opportunity in tech, especially right now, which is why I broke my own rule. Was great in March though.I like msft quite a bit, have been investing in them for since they started embracing open source and Linux. I paid a hefty premium, we'll see how it works out, but I feel I have a bit more room for error with them than most. It's also tough to hit buy points using a DCF with tech companies. I scooped up a ton in March.Before earnings the everyone was saying that COVID will benefit Azure because of the increase in WFH and need for remote tech. Interesting to see how the narrative has changed.It's a business communication platformWow I love slack I thought everyone used itThe world isn't ending, it's evolving.You’re extremely closed minded by this statement my friend. Look beyond the pandemic and what they are going to evolve the world into.I know but the it's changing so fast, and this pandemic thing showed that businesses can rise or plummet without obvious reason. As a long term I considered only gold, now learning to be more open-mindedWhy JNJ?Windows ME was the last version of windows that was still built on top of dos.

XP and later were built on top of windows NT.

There are probably very few computer systems still running 95 98 or me$180 ain’t happening lolThis guy gets itThanks for the Frontline worker that you are.  All of you are undervalued.honest question, what is the typical age of patients in shit shape because od covid?Really? Entire hospital; 25%?Why are over 90% of hospitals in the US furloughing doctor's then?What price point would you wait to enter a bigger position with MSFT? These stocks have been over priced for months, how do you evaluate whether the PS ratio multiple matters as much as the momentum of the stock?The same could be said about any tech growth stock.It’s a growth company and Azure will surpass AWS easily. 200 is an easy buy imo. EOY it will be 230+ imo.My understanding was always that businesses wouldn't approve new contracts during the pandemic while they scrambled just to convert their staff to WFH via existing systems, but it served as a strong catalyst for the approval of future integrations. It's possible this is priced into the share price to a degree, but I think the actual COVID upswing is totally unreflected in the recent quarter's earnings.It did in other respects (teams and gaming). Companies are not eager to take on huge cloud contracts atm during the pandemic. Cloud is still relatively young.MSFT gifted out teams and azure growth was slowed in part due to the fact the physical data centres were at capacity. Due to the massive amount of cores spun up for teams. New azure subscriptions and core requests were getting restricted to health care. 

Teams is sticky nobody will be rolling it back, it will lead to to more Premium azure ad licences long term and cross selling opportunities.Madness to bet against MSFT, COVID is short term, in 20 years AI and cloud computing will be lead by MSFT.My point exactly lol... I work in finance and tech.. I've never seen anyone mention slack too communicate anything over their platform it's always a msft product.. 

So that should tell you how mighty msft isOnly two have best credit ratings.why not?But windows NT still has some underlying DOS code.Maybe not anytime soon, but you can't pull it off the table entirely unless you're in fantasy land where you don't think another correction is possible (sadly that's going to most likely be wrong). 

If it doesn't I'll most likely be happy with holding 10-20 shares as more exposure to the cloud.My answer would only be anecdotal since it's only my personal experience and thus might not reflect the situation as a whole. But I would say mostly age 50 to 70. Deaths have dropped a lot each week since this began as our docs learn what meds work best, what pathways work best for each patient (like maybe choice of vent/no vent for example), but elderly patients still don't fare well (80+). But yea I've been surprised but how many 40 and 50 year olds end up in extremely critical condition with it. From what I've seen the 20-40 year olds who get it bad enough to need to come in don't usually escalate to critical care. They feel like dog shit and they look like it too, but after a few days of it they're good to go. The first few weeks were the scariest by far, I had two ladies in early forties who were otherwise fairly healthy die from it. So people need to realize, yes your chances of survival are very high if you are under like 70, but that doesn't mean it can't happen to you. It had me and still has me very worried for my mother who is older than both of them and works in the school system. That's another thing I can speak to, as I work in cardiology: kids going back to school in America right now is an awful idea. The extremely small percentage of kids who are dying from COVID are dying because of an issue with dilation of their coronary arteries, which is something that doesn't cause many symptoms and to my knowledge you would need an echo to truly know or not. Kids could be developing that for several days and you not even know it. Schools are gonna be breeding grounds for COVID. I hope that enough people have had it that we slowly form herd immunity, but the truth is no one really knows.

The other thing people need to consider. This virus is less than a year old, we don't have any earthly clue what all things it causes. It could be no other new things, it could be dozens. When HIV/AIDS first hit no one knew how it was spread, what all it caused and we didn't know for several years. Again in cardiology, I would use the example of rheumatic fever. Which back when it was a big thing, it just caused kind of a flu like issue. Years later it's found that for several people it causes deterioration of the mitral valve leaflets, which can be life threatening if went unknown and untreated over the years, which it often was. Many of them need valve replacements which is often equals a lifelong change in quality of life when blood thinners are needed. 

This is complicated, because as a whole you can't just shut down and never do business until a vaccine is widely administered, but you also CANT HAVE YOUR POPULATION SPREADING MISINFORMATION, REFUSING TO WEAR MASKS OR OTHER THINGS TO SLOW SPREAD AND ACTING LIKE IT'S NOT A DEAL AT ALL. Very disappointed in my country right now.Yes. However it should be clarified that not every single one of those patients are there for covid specific illness, a handful just tested positive while here for something else. Let's say out of 100 covid positive patients we have, 15 of those are people who are here for like a kidney issue or heart attack who also happened to have mild case of COVID. On top of that, we still are limiting full amount of non COVID patient outflows, so as a whole, it makes sense that the percentage of patients in our hospital who have covid is extremely higher than the amount of people in the general public who have it.The fact you ask this question, means you don't work in the field or haven't done enough critical thinking or reading to fully comprehend it. Which is fine, mind you, not everyone should know everything about everything. But don't act like you know what the fuck you're talking about.

I can't speak for all countries, but in America COVID hit the hardest in early March. This wasn't true for every state at first, but it was true for my hospital in Indiana. We had a sudden influx of COVID patients, a lot of whom were in critical condition and escalating quickly. I remember the first week the plan was to dedicate around 60 beds of a unit for covid only patients, that lasted only the first week. Then we dedicated another 40, few days later another area, then a week or so later another unit. We were up to like 200 covid only beds in a hospital that's only around 4-500 beds total. Around May we started to see a slow steady decrease in the number of new covids, and a decrease in how severe their condition got. The latter being likely a result of staff now knowing what medicines and pathways to treat these patients after having experience with it for a few weeks. We've had far less covid patients dying percentage wise.

Anyway, throughout that March to like early June period, our hospital and from what I hear most hospitals in USA, closed 99% of outpatient testing down. Outpatient testing is a huge part of business. For example I'll give you a perspective from my world of cardiology. A patient comes into our adjoined outpatient building for an echocardiogram, which in and of itself is a small charge. If everything looked great then that's a small profit made there. If patient had an issue with a valve, they would typically then come in for outpatient TEE to evaluate true severity and need for surgical intervention, another profit there. If surgery is needed then they come in as outpatient for several weeks to do the actual surgery, then a couple days of intensive care during that immediate healing stage, then a week or so of impatient cardiac rehab, more testing to make sure everything looks good before discharge. So much staff is involved in that patients process: echo techs, reading cardiologist, surgeons and their nurses and techs, ICU nurses, x-ray techs, CT techs sometimes, rehab techs, cleaning staff, any docs who need to see that patient while they are there who aren't directly related to the valve replacement, like maybe a diabetes doctor or kidney doctor. All of that staff is now not doing these jobs, because we don't get to see that patient come in for the outpatient echo to begin with and get that process started. The hospital is losing money every day, by having to not allow outpatients and by having to limit how much care inpatients are getting in an interest to slow the spread and protect workers.

 The only staff who are busier or as busy as they were pre covid, are the staff directly involved in covid patient care. Not every doc has the credentials and skills to care for them, same for nurses. Those staff are often forced to use PTO, some cases file for unemployment, etc. If you were that cardiac rehab tech aforementioned, your patient workload went to like ten percent of what it was. A manager doesn't need six rehab techs right now, they need two. Then the staff who can work with intensive covid patients are overworked and mentally exhausted. Having to be paid overtime by the hospital, more money lost for hospital.

So as you can see from this one small example, of which there are dozens I can make from many different affected staff and fields: business is overly busy on the covid side, but because of need to reserve resources for potential covid patients, the hospital is losing money on almost everything non covid related. Budget cuts will have to be made, many have had furloughs as you said. But you're missing the point. The furloughs are happening to people who can no longer do their job and theyre happening because the hospital has to limit losses right now. 

So doctors furloughed doesn't not equal covid is gone. In fact as you can see, the severity of covid caused the need for those furloughs.Which is why I’m not holding too much mega-cap tech right now. I’m being very selective with the tech I hold because I feel much of it is overvalued. But I can see why people like Microsoft.>It’s a growth company and Azure will surpass AWS easily.

Yeah... I don't know about that, but I guess we'll see. I'm a dev and I much prefer AWS to azure, but one edge azure has is that many companies see amazon as a competitor and don't want a single byte of their data in aws.

Whether they do or don't, I agree with you that msft is going to continue to grow and take market share.I think all that is true, I also think much of that is priced into the stock already.Lot of people use slackIt was teams before teams.   Tons of people use itNo it doesnt. Nt was not built on dos

https://www.quora.com/Is-Windows-still-based-on-DOSThanks, that was very informative and detailed. I can lookup mortality rate by age but it doesnt tell me what is the condition for someone of my age.You seem to know quite a bit so explain why hospitals are putting people on ventilators that don't need to be and then subsequently dying because of it. Is it because they are receiving (and not disclosing mind you) $39,000 per patient that they place on a ventilator? 

The data doesn't coincide with what you are saying. COVID has less than a 1% death rate for anybody below the age of 50. I'm sure it is even less when you factor out those without any pre-existing conditions (i.e. obesity) or those who were labeled "COVID" deaths, but died of other causes while testing positive from COVID (i.e. getting shot in the head) or "coughing" while in hospice and then dying WITHOUT testing positive.Tech is the future. It isn't going anywhere..

We will literally be human cyborgs in another 100 years lol. (I'm kidding of course, but at the same time not really).

We are so integrated with technology and it has only just begun. I like investing in companies at the forefront of that innovation. Microsoft is the type of company to invent something that shifts generations. They've done it before and they will do it again.Existing markets, early adopters, and dev already use aws no doubt, but it’s who doesn’t already have cloud that matters now and MSFT has a huge edge. 

Expanding to businesses that will need it will choose Azure easily.Im not a respiratory or ICU doc, nor an RT, so I can only give you my understanding of it. For the first few weeks resp docs were throwing a lot of people on vents pretty quick, but from what I've seen that has decreased significantly since then. I can think of several reasons for that. The biggest being that vents can kind of be thought of as a safety switch you can flip when you're worried a patient is at the point of dying from related issues. It's a move you make to sacrifice some other things in order to just keep the human alive long enough to figure out how best to treat them. So in early March docs were unexperienced with best way to treat the average ICU COVID pt and were also suddenly flooded with more any more of those patients. The easiest thing to do in interest of keeping people alive was to put them on vent if even remotely needed. So you can see why and how that could happen where at first vents were used and needed like crazy. Now with that said, for some diseases and disease processes, vents can do more harm than good for a lot of patients and their long term prognosis and COVID has looked like one of those diseases. Here I've seen a dramatic decrease in the number of COVID patients on vents. Again the reason why is multi faceted. We know what drugs work best for different stages of the disease which keeps some COVIDs  from progressing as far, we have cross trained some capable nurses/PAs/NPs to be able to help out a bit on patient load letting docs spend more time on the more critical COVIDs, we know that with COVID the longer a patient is on the vent the more likely they are to crash coming off the vent which leads us to not leave them on a second longer than needed. 

Btw, this whole getting shot in the head but being counted as a COVID death seems nothing more than political minded talking head bull shit and when I talk to people in the actual know, they tell me it is as well. I'm more likely to take the word of the people actually responsible for reporting these things than a Facebook post or a talking head on Fox News. So do with that what you will.

It is very easy in life, especially nowadays, to assume the worst of someone when presented with an issue. To assume that everyone must be out to make a buck somehow, that everyone must be faking numbers for X reason, so on and so forth. The people caring for these patients and reporting numbers and so on are normal Joe schmo's like you and me. It is true that hospitals are reimbursed an amount per covid patient, or at least it was for a time, I'm not sure if it still is. But as we discussed earlier, hospitals are losing money hand over fist right now, there's a reason they're being paid that money. Could that lead a hospital to claim more cases than they truly have? I'm sure some hospital somewhere has done so, sure. Does than mean all of them or even a handful are doing that? No. 

Also, who gives a flying fuck whether the person dying from COVID has diabetes or other comorbidities. They are humans, who are dying, what's hard to grasp about that? Is there life worth less than yours because they are 30 pounds overweight? Yes they are more likely to die, but people are also dying who have zero comorbidities. I'm confused as to where your motivations are coming from here. What is your point?I agree with that. The thing is is that everyone in entire world agrees with that and is buying Microsoft accordingly. Will Microsoft be a strong and innovative company for the next 10 years? Yes. Will its stock outperform the market in that same period? I’m not sure. People were saying the same thing about Microsoft in 2000, and in fact they were totally correct. But Microsoft still underperformed the market in the period up until about 2016. Believe me, it’s a company I’d love to own, but its strong run-up this year isn’t sustainable long term.No one is arguing that these big tech companies will continue to do well. The question is whether they are fairly priced right now.Yeah don't disagree, azure is solid and will continue to eat market share.Not OP, but you really should care about whether they have other health issues. The USA is a very unhealthy country, who for the most part hasn’t really cared about their health. We’re the fattest country on Earth.

Combine that with the fact most people are uneducated, most live paycheck to paycheck, and you’ve got a perfect recipe for failure.The CDC's website literally says you can be in the vicinity of somebody who had a cough and if you pass away it counts as a COVID death.  This isn't some political figure head saying you can get shot in the head and be counted as a COVID death... this is literally the "experts".  

To your last point, I care if people have other preexisting conditions because they are inflating the numbers for people who don't.  If you are at risk, stay home.. but we don't need to shut down the economy when most of the population has a strong enough immune system.  It makes zero fucking sense to close down businesses.. let people make a conscious decision to go out or not based on their health.  It's so ungodly fucked up that the gov't is forcing businesses to close over a disease that is no worse than the flu (other than the fact it spreads more). 

Why are you fucking people so concerned about the coronavirus when the flu kills more people?!?!?!? What about heart disease?  The leading killer in America... and yet we praise fat obese people because "they love themselves".  It is actually incredible how COVID has suddenly made people angels who only care about others... and yet they don't even have enough self respect to care for themselves??  It makes no sense.Maybe I should have worded what I said differently. I was not saying that obese people are healthy. I was not saying they aren't at higher risk when getting COVID. I was speaking at the rhetoric some people have been saying that is essentially, well that person was obese so of course they died, as if we should only care about deaths when a perfectly healthy person dies. People are dying, period. The lack of compassion and morality is what I'm irked at.I mean, I don’t have compassion for those people, the people who have not cared about their health. I really don’t. I’d also imagine that a good percentage of those people may not even have worn masks or didn’t treat it as seriously as they should have. 

I reserve my compassion for healthy adults who are intelligent enough to wear masks yet get the virus anyway and are unable to fight it off. The older people who refuse to wear masks? No compassion. The older people wear masks and happen to get it and die? They get compassion.

People shouldn’t just look at people’s deaths and automatically give compassion when responsibility is a huge part of this. Like I said, the USA is the fattest country on earth, which as you know, comes with a huge host of complications, which increases the risk of death. 

Would you give compassion to a guy who refused to wear a seatbelt for decades and happened to die of complications from car a crash? What if he was aggressively against it, mocked the seatbelt laws and regulations? I’d hope not. He arguably deserved it.I agree with everything you just said. I think the reason we are on different wavelengths here is because I'm talking and thinking about compassion towards those dealing with COVID as a whole and you're talking about compassion towards those dealing with COVID on a case by case basis. I agree that I have far less compassion for those you mentioned, I wouldn't say zero, but far less yes. I think you're looking at life a bit too black and white. People can be fifty pounds overweight and turn their life around, you see it everyday here on subreddits like OMAD, intermittent fasting, fitness, LoseIt, etc. My wife who had been a normal weight her entire life had our child, had post partum depression and developed an eating disorder. She got up to around 90 lbs overweight in a surprisingly quick amount of time. She's now lost 70-75lbs in 18 months through eating disorder counseling, counting macros and routine exercise. Did she deserve to die last year while she was obese? Its very easy to get overweight, especially in America. We should not praise people for being overweight, for being "comfy in their own skin". My wife would be the first one to tell you that. We need a change in the overall public shift of eating, counting calories, exercise and not praising those who are overweight. But there are nuances to it. If more people learn how to talk to those who are overweight in a way that will help motivate them without intensely condemning them, we will see progress. More parents start teaching their children about portion control and the basics of calories. We could talk about this for hours. Point was, I get where you're coming from and even agree that less compassion should be shown in those instances. But they are still human lives. They are still your countrymen and often our own friends and family. They can still progress to better points in their life. To say they don't care about their health enough right this second and they get COVID, who cares if they are the ones dying, that seems very short sighted and simplified to me.Thank you for that. I like your organization as well. It was pleasant to read.I love these, thank you for sharing.

Have you ever backtested these to see if these plays you notice are generally profitable? Or maybe just hedges?Thanks for sharing! Fantastic website - been using it the past 2 weeks. The ticker search sometimes bugs out on Firefox though, FYI.HD seems like a strong bullish play given the reintroduction of lockdowns, and the "essentiality" of their stores coupled with strong consumer push towards DIY projects.amzn for example, how are you see someone is making a straddle trade from looking at the bar graphs alone? Am i missing something?Pretty new to options here, I saw a similar article in Yahoo finance about 40k calls being bought for GE 10c 1/15/21. I'm not really sure how well of an indicator that is but I threw some money at it to keep track of it and take it as a learning experience on following some of the big players.

The 40k calls were split between 3 accounts (unknown whether they were individuals or firms) 1 for 2000 calls, 1 for 5000, and 1 for 32000.Ah yes, the perfect little paragraphs to read with my red wine. Very well displayed information. Cheers my good sir 🥂I read there is a lot of insider selling of MRNA, what do you all think?Damn, how do you find this!?!Thanks for the insights, this is really helpful stuffI picked up QD Jan ‘21 calls based on unusual OTM interestwait what? why would osmeone buy 200 and 220 strikes for HD

isn't that just pure delta movement at that pointHow do you know one person bought all these calls on each ticker, or on that amzn straddle. How do you know it wasnt 2 independent people selling calls and puts? Just curiousDoes looking at these option activity actually work most of the time? For example, for home depot, what if that person shorted a shit ton of shares and bought calls to hedge their bet?How do we know these big players, especially the ones still betting on Moderna, aren’t just richer autists like us...

I remember playing poker in Vegas at low limit tables, and just assumed the guys at the high limit tables were better poker players... when I finally got to sit at a higher limit table, it turned out they were just as dumb as those of us at the low limit table... sometimes even dumber...You skipped blackstoneWhen people make these extradonary bets like on low volume tickers, like HD, are you suspicious they are trading insider information?These are awesomeThanks for the info. Hopefully I can profit off the whales.Q2 earnings for HD will be very positive. Lotta doomsday procrastinators and Stuck-At-Home remodelers. Thank you op!Having looked at these, every single one of these moves is solid. I agree with each one actually. BABA is undervalued for sure because they picked up business from COVID and then the Chinese economy rebounded nicely. 

HD has been packed lately.

MAR was oversold.

ESTC Elasticity is what cloud service providers need to scale up.great chart and analysis!What criteria are you using to determine if a trade is opening, closing, long, or short?This is great information. Thank you for sharing. May I ask what is your primary data source for time and sale activity and if it is deemed reliable ?AMZN have smashed earnings.Was there a similarly large put position opened in BABA to potentially suggest a straddle or hedge?[deleted]Good post. Keep me updated on your work!Where can you get data for options prices?Can somebody please explain this Amazon strangle? - Im asking for 2 reasons, I was dumb enough to buy some calls on Amzon about a week ago after 2-3 days moved my automated sell from 100% to like 130. It hit  100% then pulled back and I got out up 40%. That money I left on the tables would have been helpful. 

Two, I'm visiting a friend out of town and have a 2 hour drive home before work tomorrow so I'm hoping somebody can help me learn something while I'm busy driving and cant research for myself.Appreciate the write-ups and DD, as well as your insights.  If you have a minute, curious about your thoughts on $60 strike CHWY August calls last Friday.  VOD and STM were also on my radar and directionally relevant.  Would love your thoughts on any of those.Great report... thank you.This report kicked ass, thank you!Do you know what strike price the BABA calls were for?Thank you for this post. I appreciate other people that are truly on here to put information out there and help. If you don’t know, I trade options all the time. And I’ve noticed you discuss a lot of my plays almost every week. So let me ask you, do you trade yourself? Are you a positive options trader and how much of this option flow correlates your gains or losses? Just curious. thank you again.I love a good conspiracy. When interest rates went negative in Europe. The technology sector in the United States went up. It's my personal belief that there is a carry trade from Europe to the United States technology sector. Call me a loser call me an idiot I still believe itis there any verification that these trades aren't just a part of some greater strategy? Like how do we know these aren't market makers hedging other positions we aren't seeing?This is beautiful thank you. My mom told me to invest in Moderna this weekend. Last time she told me to invest in Novavax and I didn't listen. I won't make that mistake again. The mother has spoken.Scrubs are going to buy options like HD and ESTC and wont be able to sell for a profit because of the low volume.MRNA otm calls all I can think about every new person with a rh account opening theseSuper easy to read, great job.OP—I really appreciated this post! Great to read and I love your concise interpretations, I wish my analysts were as organized as you👏🏼Cool post, good read, thanks for the good info!Baba could be a good call, share price in HKEx is already up 1%.How do you know if someone is buying or selling an option because theres always a buyer and a seller for each option, how do u know which side is the initiator?good researchPeople are nuts. That’s a lot of money wagered. 

I wonder who’ll win.Yoo swaggy! 

I follow you on Twitter too! 

Thank you for what you do for FREE!!! 

Love you bro, no homo.I was wondering - on the Amazon short straddle, does the trader most likely use two separate accounts to enter at exactly the same time? As the size of the trade might be a market mover and affect their ability to enter as planned on the second leg?Nice chart, and good explanation. This player is hedging for earning call for Amazon. I think Amazon has the chance to break expectations this week, but I need some help to decide whether I should keep my call option for earning calls.Is there anyway to see when these whales end up selling their positions too?Thanks for sharing swaggy!

What's going on w/ HUYA, tons of options activity expiring this week.Looks like amazon is going to run up into earnings.Looks like some insider trading jumping off to meWith all due respect, this unusual options activity is nothing more than tossing a coin. I have followed the Najarian brothers on this a lot and they are wrong almost 50% of the times. One recent example is that of Netflix. Netflix had an extremely high call volume and several big bets. And the stock came crashing down. Nobody can remotely predict the market. Only look at this info for unusual options activity for entertainment/academic purpose. Don't trade based on that.This post just took my investing to the next level.  Thank youUnusual option activity in your mom's anusOk but I sold at a loss on most of those, can’t participate huhThanks for this. I’m surprised people are that bullish on moderna, a company that has 0 product. I have been debating on buying puts for some time now.Your site is the bomb swaggy! Ignore this if it's a stupid question as I'm still learning, but is it worthwhile -- or even possible -- to xref this data against market maker (especially dark pool) short activity? I'm curious if it's possible to differentiate between directional bets/insider trading and institutional hedgingYou forgot $IDEXNo problem, there can be a lot of data to look at and read. I’m working on a platform that focuses on the organization and visual display of data.[removed]A lot of activity is hedges, but I’ve found some of the unusual activity can be analyzed as a directional bet. I try to look deeper into the activity to see if they are part of another leg. Looking at things such as similar volume and expirations. You can sometimes figure out if it’s a spread, strangle/straddle, or if they are rolling out a position.I'm pretty new to options, so maybe this is a naïve question. But is it possible for OTM calls to be hedges?

I definitely got burned by putting some money on a massive unusual activity put that turned out to be a hedge last week. But I can't figure how a call could be a hedge move.Ok, I will look into that. Thanks for the heads up!I bet a large portion of the Work From Home demographic is coming from workplaces that offered extensive amenities to their employees.  All those tech jobs where the buildings had fully stocked kitchens, exercise and entertainment equipment, laundry, electric vehicle charging, etc.

How many of those employees let their own homes fall into disrepair because they could justify just using those facilities at work?  Now they all have to fix their shit at the same time.Yeah man this and LOW are gonna blow up big on the run up to earnings and quite possibly  beyond. 

The places by me are packed daily. Neighbors work there. They broke there best day ever ,which is normally week of 4th of july, on a Tuesday in April and each week has been at least a double from last year's numbers. 



I got 8/28 150c for LOW 2 weeks ago. Already up 70% def gonna sell day before and dump a decent chunk into shares/ calls after the iv crush is waxed away.The image for AMZN isn’t very accurate, I’m sorry. I just noticed today that for tickers with extremely large amounts of data the filtering by time range doesn’t work well because it limits the entries to 500. Going to work on fixing this today or tomorrow.

Also, if you check yahoo finance you can see the contracts are there on the OI.It’s not at all. Stay far away from GE. It’s a piece of crap.I did the same. Morningstar fair value is 10.60 as well.Not much to think of it. They're liquidating their assets at a good price. If we're talking about the same person, he still has 24 million shares of MRNA











A lot of the time insiders selling shares isn't too big of a red flag, especially when it's at an ATHNOPEJust sift through the data to see if there is anything interesting.Yeah it is pure delta. I’m not sure why, but I come across plays like this occasionally, deeper ITM calls.I could see someone doing it to enable 4:1 leverage (within their portfolio, such a long-short fund) without having to pay for margin or being restricted by their broker's margin requirements. In fact, the lower the IV, the cheaper it is to leverage this way.The open interest today on the 200 strike is 1579, and the OI on the 220 strike is 1566. In retrospect it looks like the volume was from selling to close the calls.I don’t know, but the fact that it was a pretty large position, with the same amount of contracts on both trades, with same expiration date, with the orders placed at just about the same time allows me to make a good guess.

I find options activity is like a puzzle without a reference image and you just do what you can to try and figure out what is going down.The scenario you pointed out is possible. Anything is possible really, UOA is not an indicator of what is going to happen, more of a piece of the puzzle and a look into what might only one side of the trade. 

That’s why there is a lot of research and analytics that go into figuring out what is happening. I haven’t full tracked every ticker, but most of the ones from my posts have been correct... but then again, I could just be lucky 😉I agree, but the positions are so large the likelihood of dumb is pretty lowYes you are right. It was on my list, not sure what happened. Oops.That’s what I wanna know. These are pretty immense bets to make. And they don’t seem to be guaranteed either. So one would assume that they know something we don’t. Or they could just be ballsey? But that doesn’t seem as likely. I’m new to the option world but this does seem strange.I think any service you use is going to be using their “best” guess of if it was sold or bought to open or closing a position. Whether it’s opening or closing though, the sentiment is the same, but I usually look for opening positions for directional bets. If someone was short and is closing that short with bullish activity, it’s still bullish activity. 

Some of the really far OTM or ITM plays have a skew of last price to bid/ask which is *normally* accurate (but not always). That’s probably the best indicator.

For smaller positions that are closer to the at the money price and have last price at the mid it’s probably a toss up on the direction of the trade. For those ones my algo analyzes delta IV and price change relative to stock movement and tries to make its best guess. It also depends on the stock because not every stock will be as liquid as SPY or AAPL with the range of the spread.

I’m not too worried about those smaller trades though for the following reasons:

1. My algo can spot the far OTM directional bets and categorize those appropriately. It’s not perfect but I would say it’s pretty accurate and normally aligns with data from other services such as FlowAlgo and CheddarFlow. 

2. The “unusual” trades normally have very high volume to OI or premium paid, so the bulk of sentiment will be on those bigger trades making the 100k trades less significant in the big picture.I can vouch for Optionsonar. I find it offers the most amount of data, though you kind of have to dig yourself. Though the latest filters they have added have it made it far easier to drill down to the interesting plays.But enough to move >15%?Not that I noticed. For a big co like BABA it’s common to see trades within the $1-5 million range. This one was 18k contracts for $55 million.  Was pretty significant. Strange that the strike was ITM though.Pretty much creating a synthetic stock position. Delta is nearly at 1.0 at these strikesSame but I'm new lol, might pick up some 280s though.AMZN just had a pretty hard pull back (I think 10% drop last week from all time highs). In my opinion, not a bad entry point for AMZN right now. If the position I posted is indeed correct, then it just assumes that the player who opened the position is expecting a drop in volatility over the next month and for the stock to stay in a range for a while. Simply put, his reasoning might be that there aren’t any big catalysts to move it higher, but also thinks AMZN is fundamentally strong and won’t be pushed lower. He’s playing the volatility to drop post-earnings considering volatility is still very high, relatively speaking.If you had a $100 million long position and then you caught wind of some info that might deteriorate your position, so you place a $10 million hedge. That hedge is just a directional of a bet as a play that is not a hedge because your are expecting some downside.

So hedge or not it’s still the same as a directional bet.I bought Moderna and Novavax in April and sold it in April, damnCan you explain more?-13% today lol ouchFor smaller bets it’s a toss up. For the larger plays that are “unusual” there is usually a skew to one side, either bought or sold to open. The reason is that because of either the volume, the money-ness, and the liquidity of the options creates an advantage for the option seller, in this case the Market-Maker.

If a player buys 10,000 contracts they are most likely paying a premium closer to the ask price, rather than paying the mid price. For the average trader buying a couple contracts they will get a fill at the mid price... but for larger bets there is a premium to pay to get that amount of volume in a trade.Yesss let’s goooThe more I think of it I’m pretty sure he has a very large share position and protected with this new position expecting a beat, but maybe unsure by how much so that he collects on volatility.Normally you would see the position disappear from the OI all at once or in increments as they close a position. Or sometimes they leave until expiration ... it’s all tracked in the volume but you can truly only tell opening or closing by the open interest on the following day.Because their earnings were not great... that’s the reason.It’s definitely possible. I don’t have dark pool data so I can’t do it. There’s been multiple times I’ve come across people posting big dark poop trades that are associate with some of the activity I posted.Neat swaggy. I've commented before I like your platform and unusualwhales. You guys should team up.

Regarding plays, I'm actually more interesting in the MRNA put side, [seen here on UW](https://unusualwhales.com/alerts/695e44af-c1a9-4870-88bf-789347163b7a). Image for lazy: https://gyazo.com/add85362c50ac92c79aa07c295ddfb49

Personally I think because of the news on AZN tomorrow (later today?), MRNA will jump down Monday/Tuesday. All boats won't rise as people also look at the data considering MRNA. It looks like this is an actually slightly worse version of their previous results on a larger size.

AZN's results are really positive, and already have simulated t-cell responses properly. That is far more than MRNA. This is coupled with the fact there was huge insider selling in MRNA. I think the call side is probably wrong, and people should be shorting this (remember the run from 90-59 a few weeks ago? This is that, and worse, given a competitor).

I think you gotta look at context, always, which is why I appreciate UW. Always maps out historical info and shit.Where did you get the data from?That's cool!  Assuming you heard of Unusual Whales?  Similar concept - they have a subscription level,  I'm sure there's room for another.  Good luck.Thanks for doing a service! Can’t wait to see what you come up with.

There’s a ton of data out there, most people just have trouble interpreting it, so a service that helps interpret that data is invaluable.yo can someone ban this man?That's really cool. How do you use these findings to direct your own plays?Not only is it possible, but it's what people use options frequently for.

If you own 100 shares of Tesla, you could buy a $1000 put for January so you know that, at worst, you can sell your shares for $1000

Additionally, you can sell calls on stocks you own to lower your cost basis (while capping your max earnings).

You can sell calls on a ticker you have a call on to create a vertical, hedging your original bet, too.Yes? If you already have calls ITM, you hedge by selling OTM calls. 

Another way to hedge it by BUYING OTM calls is to hedge against your puts, say your put has made some profit, of course you're gonna lose profit on a bounce but OTM calls that have enough volume could reduce your losses on the bounce while still keeping that position. 

I'm sure there's a few other strategies but thats a couple. 

Options are insurance against shares.What website is this? Thanks ..Is it too late to buy the 8/28 150c for LOW?Same question.  In particular, from https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow/AMZN, I see two contracts with Sep 18 Expiry:

1. AMZN Sep20 $2950 C $1.17M
2. AMZN Sep20 $2900 P $1.56M

If those were from the same trader, sure looks like a short strangle.  What am I missing?

How do I find what you're referring to on YF?Yea but if you had faith in your company's vaccine then you surely wouldnt sell as it would go higher right?Where specifically are you pulling the data from? Interested in trying this out.I agree. Seems pretty clearly to obtain leverage. Personally I'd prefer to obtain leverage via options than margin but that isn't exactly strictly rationalAs MRNA drops 12% today I’m starting to think my analogy is sadly accurate...I assume if someone is dropping 100k+ on a directional play they know something most dont ya.By September 18th? Easy.Right that’s why I asked because the position was so large. But I suppose when you’re so far ITM the risk is much less so it’s insanely bullishPercent I had some Amazon calls and set my limit sell order up 100% when did the mass and realized it made it to like 170% I take back all of my losses and one trade. It never made it that high and then pulled back a little. I got out up 40%  which is pretty great  but Had I left my original stop in place it would have gotten me out around 100% gain which would have made up for my biggest loss plus a little bit more. Trade was profitable to the hole I dug myself into the smaller than it used to be add I left well enough alone it would be even smaller

I still have a fairly sizable hole to dig out of now I'm looking for things I can do that should make money but limit my risk little bit more. Yeah that might take me a little longer to get out of the hole but it's also less likely to dig the hole deeper as wellSure, but let's say you've identified an arb opportunity by selling a synthetic and buying delta equivalent spot.

Then you're not making a directional bet. Are you filtering such positions somehow?Leaving money on the table often feels just as bad as losing itI had experienc with a Netgear option with a very low option trade volume (you can extropolate option trade volume from stock trade volume/ or directly look at it). I had an option with a theoretical value of $200, but buyers were only offering $100 for a $200 option. Because of the low volume, and large spread between the bid and ask price, I lost most of my investment (short position).

edit: parenthesisKids got wrecked todaythank you for replying! also thank you for providing us this data, it really is insightfulWould be interesting to see what's going on with those Moderna calls, at least the July 24th ones lol.What are these "dark poop" trades you speak of?


Couldn't help it, apologies in advance you do great work! Also a fan of your website.Fantastic, thanks! I've been looking for a reason to try FlowAlgo or Squeeze MetricsI hate it when the big guys do all their business in dark poopIt is now a sprint to the finish line of who gets the vaccine.  If you short MRNA and they win you are screwing yourself.  
All these vaccine tickers are volatile and can swing in either direction with one tweet, quote, or mention on CNBC.


So, what is the best way to play MRNA, pfizer, and AZN?
Spreads?  Sell puts?I think your take on MRNA (inferior science, insider activity, etc.) is **exactly** how the market will price the vaccine race.  And that, for traders, is all that matters.  I know of several people that opened puts last week.Very good response, thanks for adding it here.I created a tool that scans option chain data for big trades.Deleted. What was the gist?I thought that was pretty much the explanation he posted. Basically, here's what the big players are doing, and if you want you can copy their plays.Yes, but some of these were single people buying deep OTM calls. Can buying a call be a hedge move? I can see how having an option to sell shares you own is a good hedge, but I'm not grasping how an option to buy shares is a hedge. I guess you could hedge a short position by buying an OTM call?Eh earnings aren't for another 4 weeks.  You could go 160 but its risky due to general market pullback sell before  earningSometimes a company insider can have a large percentage of their total wealth tied up in company stock so this is just a way to put some eggs in another basket.

They will keep a decent amount in stock but look to diversify.At the same time you have to have a very high risk tolerance to hold 24 million shares of a single company.  Even if I thought it would go higher I would sell a lot of my shares just for the peace of mind.His website, he even posted the link for lazy like you :)Because of the amount of slippage an order of that size has to pay?In which case you are absolutely correct, there’s no way to tell what’s going on behind the scenes.

At the same time, unusual options activity isn’t an indicator or guarantee of a winning position. If it was, everyone would just hop on the train for free money.

I like the challenge of trying to piece certain plays together and see if it’s smart money making a move and also why they are making that play.Ah, so because there were so few buyers and sellers (volume) it didn’t matter the worth, you couldn’t execute a trade with anyone.I think both those sites have great value. It takes a lot of research to figure stuff out though, don’t expect all the data to be handed to you on a platter!There's nothing worse than dark poops shitting all over your portfolioOr buy puts on all. If only one gets it, the rest drop a lot. You’ll lose on one but win on all the othersI just saw that sorry! But nice tools thanks!It was a discord invite linkI meant I wanted to know specifically what OP did. All that research surely goes into trades. I was curious how he/she approached itCorrect.

* You're short stock so you hedge by buying calls
* You're short a call so you hedge by buying a further OTM call to create a vertical
* You buy a call to turn a put into a strangle if you're expecting volatility but no longer want to be directionalIf you short sell shares you can buy calls to cover any popsYou might also have a stock that is inversely related to the underlying you're buying calls on.  Let's say if your stock X goes down you expect underlying Y to go up.  So you buy calls on Y to hedge your position in X.There's literally an example of what you're asking right here in OP's post:

> A player opened a $47 million dollar bet, short straddle, in AMZN last week. They sold to open 1,000 of each PUT and CALL September 18 contracts at the $3015 strike price to collect a total of $47 million in premium.

This means that sometime before Sep 18, you will see UOA when this player closes their position by buying back the 1000 OTM calls.  It would be an extremely poor decision for you to go and mimic their trade buy buying those calls too.I mean 150c would go ITM if it ends up rallying even more for earnings. The theta does start decaying around now if I’m not mistaken.But you could generate recurrent income on short calls of those 24M shares.  That's a lot of round lot rent to collect from that portfolio tenant!I saw that. Where does his website pull the data from? He only mentions “3rd party”I mean anyone doing that kind of size is probably making sure it's within a reasonable margin of some theo before they enter that position. But yeah that leverage isn't gonna be freeYep, but fortunately I learned on a very cheap option. Always check volume and open intHey man I’ve only recently started trading options, as someone in your position besides experience is there any books or courses that could bring me to your level? I’m a coder too ☺️What if they all make generics right from the start? There would obviously still be a winner, but every other company would also come out on top. I'm not sure if any company would allow this on their own, but I could see the government mandating it.What if azn gets it right but still falls? Oh...Interesting possibilityAZN and PFE have a ton of other pharmaceuticals that currently make them money.  MRNA ... this vaccine is their life bloodoh you mean exactly what positions he took for these tickers?I've never even considered this, thank youTheta always decays. It just starts to hurt more nowA magician doesn’t reveal his secrets, u/swaggymediathen even better.  you lose on noneYeah, or how frequently they used this knowledge to guide their own strategyWhy should anyone trust the data?You can check the volume on your broker/app or even go to yahoo finance you will see the same volume.

I don’t make up the volume on those trades, check for yourself. I have an algo that analyzes the trade data and classifies the sentiment based on various metrics. 

Most of my data you can find on cheddarflow or FlowAlgo except those services are $80 per month and $150 per month, respectively.Do, Don’t, it’s called personal risk toleranceAwesome! Exactly what I was looking forI don't know what HCA is but I think I'll buy an atm call expiring 7/31 because why not?A glorious looking roulette wheelIf twitter misses earnings and goes down to 28-29 buy calls for Like 2 months out no way twitter stays believe 30 in election yearLove how no one is talking about tslaIF MSFT misses. I'm expecting a huge sell off for Tech then. A lot of WFH stocks will be hit hard.
Also, thinking of hedging if congress can't pass stimulus bill, and extend unemployment benefit next week, I think markets will react negatively.IRBT has an average historical move of 20%+ on earnings... OTM strangle usually works.

I like a lotto call on SNAP and TWTR

Im grabbing Airlines UAL LUV for a run into earnings play... probably sell before report. 

$$$$$$$$$$This is gonna be the most exciting earnings week in a whilecmg putties?Think United and Southwest puts will be cheap early this week??Big week!!Well this week is packedGonna be a blood bath next weekGood luck!I'm retarded. Thought LMT earninfs were Thursday not Tuesday. Guess I'ma have to bag gold em thru earnings😂🙃It’s a shame I lost enough from speculating to where I’m taking a break because this week will be insane!!!Intel taking a nosedive at earnings you heard it first hereMsoft callsMarket will be a mix of Coachella and Burning Man with Woodstock on top lolLimelight 🚀Doing gods workOh wow, this looks like it's going to be a wild week. Better strap in!Can I see the week after or the next too? When’s GE doing earnings?Thanks a bunch for posting it.Any guesses where airlines are going this week? Got some AAL puts hoping to make a couple $$$Some lucky ass degenerate is going to make a killing on Thursdayairline puts seem too obvious. priced in already?Following Nevada coronavirus, looking like puts on LVSRemindMe! 48 hoursRemindMe! 32 HoursThis upcoming week will be scary. Let's just say maybe a new stimulus will be signed off by Friday or the following week.I know it’s not on this list but anyone think there will be a run up for Spotify? Earnings are July 29thGonna be a fun weekBeast mode!!!ThanksWho thinks TSLA earnings will be + or -?The $LOGI calls were good to me last year. May sell puts this time around. Not as strong a conviction they'll beat --- again. the $LUV calls could be a thing for Thursday as well.I wanna sell some TSLA naked calls so bad loli am going hard in skechers ;) kidding aside, what you guys playing?TSLA should be interesting.AXP $90-$85 puts, July 31st exp.I feel like it’d be risky af trading any of those. If anything a far expiration strangle seems like the best idea but those can be pricey.buckle up bitchesIf earnings are good and the pass exceptions will the stock go up or down usually?Where’s amazon? Don’t they have earnings on Thursday???This lineup of earnings looks like a bloodbathSo many stonks[deleted]LETS GOOOOOOO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ6CcEOmlYUI thought only Tesla was releasing earnings this weekShort LOVE/UAL/AAL, am I right?TSLAI like where this is going.[deleted]What you don’t know can’t hurt you, that’s why I only invest in things I don’t understandThey are a for-profit operator of healthcare facilities. 
Not sure if they will be way green because of the blank check from the government for COVID related expenses 
Or could be red from canceling non-necessary procedures for months

¯\_(ツ)_/¯Bless youPut would be better... they will miss revised earnings. Shutting down all services that generate money for the hospitals while still paying their staff has caused companies such as these to take massive losses.

Good luck though either way... with the investing climate currently any bad news may get spun positively and go upSmart play.Hey I hope that works I have one twitter put for Friday, it’s a bit OTM but I didn’t have a lot left after a lot of losing trades last week. If it makes money I’d absolutely roll it into a longer term callAt first, I fully agreed with this, but when I look back at $TWTR stock during the 2016 election, it never went up during the actual election. However, it significantly rose during August and September, which are the next two months you are suggesting. I'm wondering why Twitter stock declined during one of the most controversial elections of all time.Hopefully the bitcoin security issue doesn't affect them too much...He who must not be namedFrHave you seen how much those options cost? I'm not made of money!I think MSFT is gonna do really well.  Does anyone know where the markets expectations are for them?already got ass pounded by this weeks $15 drop in msftokay im kind of new to all of this, but im confident that msft will do well. However, will this affect the price before they release earnings or on thursday open?My concern is if MSFT revises future expectations down. I can see them as a beat that still ranks. That being said I’m cautiously bullish and have sold some credit put spreads.My fear is they will. Tons of companies negotiated reduced or deferred payments on services, cloud being one of those (and my company being one that did, granted it was AWS but still). We were able to get back on regular payments in two months, but you have to wonder if that blip is enough to fuck their quarterly numbers.MSFT will not dictate tech flow. Don’t fool yourself.I can see MSFT dropping after earnings due to deceleration of Azure growth and a more conservative outlook.do you believe the rumors that IRBT are going to miss their earnings tomorrow?Fuck yeahEarnings season, Pretty sure we have quite a few packed weeks aheadAstraZeneca data publishing on Monday will buoy the week in the beginning at leastI saw they won a huge contract, you should be able to sell on monday before earnings or was that old news?Same, last week's tech dump wrecked me. Now I'm too scared for this week. Which sucks cause I'll be bored all week with no options playsWhy do you think so?oofWhat is it?Go to Earnings Whispers website>AstraZeneca

yupHow much worse do you think the airlines can get? Flights are down 90% & they don’t expect a full recovery in travel unto 2023. 

They’re more likely to give positive guidance about layoffs & borrowing enough money to get them through than announcing anything negative that we don’t already know.More downwards potential possibleno way, chinese people are going to macau nowThere is a 29 hour delay fetching comments.

|-|-|-|-|possibly similar to netflix. sell calls before earnings. in netflix's case, best time to sell calls were 4 days before ER reportI returned my model y for quality issues.

 They announced model Ys are in the showroom for demos. (Oversupply)

They shortened the wait (due to decreased demand) to get one.

California is closed again. (Fremont factory)

Stock became a meme penny stock.

Back to reality imo.

Sub 1k$chng and $auyBruh7/30It *was* 7/22 but I guess they moved it.do not even play airlines.Too much research. I'm out. Going with ABB now.I hope your username did not originate from a prior investment.From what I've heard from friends hospitals are super low on money right now. Idk how true it is for HCAExcept the hacking of major influencers. It's bound to have a negative effectSell a credit spreadGuys.. msft is never going to do not well. It might sell off a bit because investors are weird, but it will recover that drop in a week or two. It's msft..

I have 15 calls dated between January and March and strikes between 190 - 24036.49 revenue and 1.38 eps https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT/They need to!!!
I’m selling a covered call and it needs to hitBoth. Can run up before earnings. If earnings are bad can tank if great can go up. Earnings plays are always risky.They would still recognize the revenue. Accrual accounting doesn’t care about when you receive payment just that you sold the goods. 

Their accounts receivable is probably massive but investors don’t care about the balance sheet these days (look at Tesla)Who knows. Doesn’t matter because I am taking a strangle so I will win either wayMonday or Wednesday?Do we have any idea what time the announcement is supposed to be on Monday? Thanks.Old news 👀same here AMZN gave everyone a haircut last week and who knows what will happen this weekThey are taking features away from their base series chips to try and hype up there K and Z series chips. They might have a lot of many, but AMD is cheaper for chips and motherboards and more powerful.Their floor is lower, there was a huge rally recentlySome of us dodged a bulletGot it. I'll be buying 2500 July 24th calls on Monday.Fremont factory is not closed.... where did you get that info?As strange as it sounds, I don't think people care.  The reason why TSLA is going parabolic are because people are playing it as a proxy to SpaceX and S&P 500 inclusion.i'll take it. need an abb workout anyways.How much are you in for ABB?😂😂😂Likewise to youSame!  All my healthcare clients have been delaying paymentsDoesn’t seem like it yetEveryone forgot already or didn't care in the first place.  The day after the hack, their stock dipped like 3% in the am and was up 1.5% by close.I don’t think users at large are that alarmed by it. There’s a lot of press saying it spells trouble but I don’t see people actually saying thatI think the hacking was actually good for twitter. People began to realize how important twitter is as a platformWell, he did say AFTER earning and IF it dips below 30. Under those 2 circumstances with the election seems like a smart play.getting hacked hasn't hurt anyone long term.I read someone left the admin Twitter login up on a public Slack channelask/bid spread is massiveARE TALKING ABOUT A PUT OR A BUY?Yeah I'm seriously going to be looking at what tesla opens at monday. I'm thinking about selling some put credit spreads. I'm not sure if I want to take the risk though.Curious as to how they could miss? Brainstorming here: Closing retail stores? Higher Q2 unemployment equals less Office licenses? Idk. Just thinking out loud.MSFT never misses, dawgthanksCould go up. Could go downThat’s reassuring. Thanks for the infoMonday, at least that's was the plan on Friday.no. it's not really how scientific publications work. For the handful of publications I have published they all came out before 5 pm, though. Of course, mine have never had such an impact or been in The Lancet!thanks for the free money lolHe is speculating that it **will** close due to the left in that stateVery good point
I don't touch TSLATSLA is too volatile for my tastes. I've tried to say trade the stock back when it was around 800 per share. 100 shares means you have huge value swings some a minute candles could have an $8 range. Suddenly you are up or down by $800, lol. Didn't really for any setup I like.I really couldn’t think of any. One strong positive that I kept going back to is that WFH has made a lot of companies to migrate to Microsoft’s systems like Teams or Sharepoint. At least my company did and everyone seemed to love it.Closing retail stores is already priced inRetail stores are a net lossDo we have any idea what time the announcement is supposed to be on Monday? Thanks.Understood, thanks for the info.No problem, wish I had the cash to capitalize on it. But I'll be there next time.Teams is free for Windows users though.netflix got blown up, microsoft will as wellExactly, there is a reason they announced that ages ago and are very transparent about any big moves.hey a simple $5 put on intel returned 12,500% todayNothings ever free.Nothings free in waterworldNot for business users which is probably 90% of all users. My company pays 5$ per month per userThere are paid features that businesses tend to want.Comparing Netflix and Microsoft, that’s ... interesting.Not blow up, just irrational exuberance getting hit with reality.  We may see MSFT take a dip $5-ish, but this just because we’re so overvalued everywhere.  I’m thinking I’ll be heavy in puts through this earnings cycle...I've not done any calls or puts and don't really understand how they work atm. It's something I need to teach myself before i start doing itExcept all that glorious salt wateri’d explain it to you but idk what i’m doing either lol. i figured it’s only $5 and what u said about intel and amd makes sense> "I made 30% this month. Is this sustainable?"

This one is the best especially given recent market conditions since April. Yes, high-IV bull markets are great for selling puts. No, this is not normal.

I cracked up laughing at one post last week from a guy who said he'd been making 8% per month "since June"."You'll want to throw a brick at number 5"Join my discord I swear we are dripping in money. Just tell us how you make yours tooYou left out: - “please help, im buy$2000c TSLA 7/17, am i fuck, why drop?”I’m honored that wheel is #2I'm #6, but try not to be annoying about it.  And #9 is always in my DMs.  Fuck outta here lol.This sub is basically everything dumb about r/wallstreetbets but not joking.Don't forget to like and subscribe my channel! What do you mean banned for self promotionPlaying earnings are dangerous.Also 99% of the people giving the advice have -50% portfolios lmao“what if I don’t have the money to execute the option?”

Everyone else on this sub explaining for the 1,000,000,000th time: well first off it’s ‘exercise’ and secondly, you can just trade the premium... you don’t have to exercise it to make money............ 10. "Leveraged ETFs shouldn't be held long term! It says in the prospectus!"
 11. "Options premium are priced according to IV!"Spot on. I think this should be in the sidebar and then instead of making a lengthy post, people can just type a number and save time.10.  What's with _____ type of post? / Here's a list of 9 post types I've been seeing. 😄 "I lost a lot of money, let me teach you 15 valuable lessons even though I haven't even figured out how to make a dime yet"  🤣🤣🤣the wheel works great. it works even greater when you sell your puts at the highest top in history.... and then sell calls for 25 years to make up for your lossPeople who make money stays quiet and read about the people who suffer as a reminder to be humbleYou forgot #stonksonlygoup"where can I find a chart of IV"

"which broker should I use in East Uzbekistan?"“I made a trade that is in the money. Should I exit?”I’m number 5. Only, I’m green so maybe not. Day trading isn’t really great for me.You forgot number 10: “I took a giant shit before market open, so, Green Day today!”So which number are you OP?Ten. "I did a lot of research into XYZ!! I think its a great idea to do open this position!!! Follow me and make money!!"

Realistically, the only research they did was pull up the ticker and hit buy/sell. Which they already did and bag holding and using this forum as a pumping vehicle.Fuck y'all, I'm wheelin' with T.And:  10.  "Can you explain this 4-legged option strategy I just pulled the trigger on, even though I'm not sure what a 'call' is?"10. "This sub has too many newbies" <---this is youLol I'm a diehard #6 as fuckYou're going to become number 10There's a #9 that posts here every day promoting his videos.  I don't know why the mods don't ban him.3 is who wins9 is the worst.This is awesome. Can't believe OP or anyone for that matter stop and think now a days. And provide a thoughful summary as TGIF lols. Golden.Don't forget:

10.  The person that is in here so often that they are annoyed by the predictability of content in the sub and have deduced it down to 9 types of people.

Also:

11.  The person that calls out the person that calls out the person, and so on and so on.10 - Mr. confidently incorrect. “A covered call and a short put are completely different.”"Why are you reporting this?"

1. I'm in it and I don't like itLmao.I'm guilty of #3.

 ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯It bothers me that 6 is grouped with all the rest. If this is a list of dumb/annoying things people say on this sub, 6 should not be on the list.So what type do you consider yourself?Instead of making it seem like this sub is a lost cause and completely unhinged, I suggest this saying “The types of people in Options Trading” hahaI’m for sure guilty of number 2 right now lol... but I’m not married to the wheel, I just think for this particular moment in time with the markets overall trading sideways, and volatility a bit higher than usual, it’s a pretty good strategy to make money... because lord knows I’m ducking garbage at identifying the top and bottom of charts as they happen in real time.This was hilariousUgh...I feel like some combination of 4 and 6. I’ll paper trade a strategy for weeks, start trading it, immediately put in my exit order after I enter, then wonder what I fucked up. 
I used to do it with back testing. I never seem to learn that liquidity is a thing :(Point number 3 is the only reasonable one lolI'm #3 for sure theta gang bitches.You forgot one:

10. "Let me tell you about the types of people in this sub...."Some like 6. I trade options by algos so complex orders to enter and not as complex to exit.>long-tern near-money options are too expensive, i prefer way OTM weekliesBought sums it up.“QUADRUPLE WITCHING HOUR”100 NVAX December 18th $14 calls.  Should I close my position? /s I know what to do lol10.”Wanna see me turn 100k to 3k?”How about "huh.  Let's try this.  AUGH WHY IS ALL THE GREEN TURNING RED?!"#5 is so accurate with this sub. The frequency with which I see people posting trading advice here like "I started this year with 50k and now I have 20 so here's 20 bullet points of advice you should follow". Bitch STFU unless you making $$ you shouldn't give adviceThis sub isn’t as bad as the others but one thing I can sure do without is the daily linked article from some obscure link farm disguised as a news site that the market is in a bubble and going down....Missing from list: Thousands of professional traders who just like to troll.I'm fine with #5.  

People could see the error of their own ways and warn you against it.12. I have 3 karma and am going to write all about technical and fundamental analysis. What’s an option?What is the point of this post? It’s actually worse reading it and the responses than reading the actual posts described.You forgot (10)
the crabby/cynical experienced pro who's tired of hearing 1-9 day in and day out and refuses to spoon feed them because of their ignorance and lack of work ethic.I dunno. Sometimes you find someone with something to say.Also worth mentioning are the terminology snobs with superiority complexes.You know, I have like ... 30% daily returns. Since Wednesday! hehelmfao wait since June so for one month? LOLPeople be like, I lost 30K in two months but I won’t teach you any lessons for free. Subscribe to my YouTube channel to know what I learned lolSo... He's made 8%.

Well I guess he's not lying...respect to that guy tho tbhShow us on this portfolio where #5 touched you lmao"I paid $40 for a $NKLA $60 put, the stock went down to $30 why did my option depreciate?"Wheel gang#6 actually seams like really solid advice, but I guess it is possible to have too much of a good thing. Unless its money of course.You spelled smart wrong.Thought for sure MSFT would beat ER this quarter, decided to play it through.  They slaughtered ER and still took a bath.  

Play ER, never again...There’s been a lot of posts about noobs getting crushed by IV even though the stock went their direction 😂 I wish op included thisEarnings are always 70% iron condors, if you lose you lose. Some anomalies like Intel. people jumped ship to AMD on that one and you had to know what was at stake with different competitors creeping up on Intel when they got lazy.Damnit.

For free, that isWSB?If they were really the same there wouldn’t be IV skew.it's merely a personal observation of common things people say :) I made no judgement.People always ask me, "Dan, how are you consistently nailing these bottoms and tops?"Then close it and do something else?I see that we will have to agree to disagree on this point, my good man.And then I quit my job to trade full time.Because the IV for those puts was 500. No, I'm not exaggerating.Because JP Morgan sucks. THATS WHY!!As someone who's trying to learn options, what exactly is the relation between the contract price and stock price?

Is there a relation at all?If you love the stocks you're wheeling long term, it's the best portfolio builder IMO#6 is fine but hearing this just after losing a ton of money is really difficult to digest, in the moment...> Play ER, never again...

Why not?  Are you ignoring the ongoing pandemic and the fact that the market as a whole took a giant digger yesterday?

Why do people think things in a vacuum, ignoring all the other factors?If options are long dated enough, it’s not as badI play earnings, but usually quick in and out short positions.  I got burned with TSLA two weeks ago with a short strangle though... and of course this week that would have made me some doughFrom what I could tell, mostly it stems from missed azure projections... 47% actual vs 55% expected. 

Maybe? Like I was expecting a fall. But not that big of a fall. 

Then tech tumbled together. 

Here's to hoping it comes back next week to like the 205-208 range[deleted]Also the, buy high sell low tradersidk if you are joking, but thinkorswimWe could also call this person Mr. iamverysmart.Truck stops.I assume your opinion is delta neutral?::beenfurloughedfor3months::There's two components. Intrinsic value and extrinsic value.

Put simply, intrinsic value is what it is worth if you exercise the contract. Strike is $100, market price $110. So the "intrinsic value" is $10.

However, in the simplest terms, based on the track record of the stock and the time left to expiration, people usually pay more than the intrinsic value for an option.

So for example $COF is at $65.06. A $70 call is worth nothing intrinsically (why would I buy shares at $70 when the market price is $65?) But the $70 calls expiring September 18th are trading for about $2.50. Why, if it's worthless?

Because based on various metrics (such as implied volatility, "the Greeks," chart analysis, etc.), bullish people think the stock will be above $70 between now and September. But rather than buy 100 shares and lock up $6,500, they can spend like $250 on a contract that gives them the right to buy the shares at $70 in the future, sorta like a weird combination of a restaurant reservation and a preorder.

Put simply, the "optionality" is worth something.

"The price of an option is ALWAYS the sum of its intrinsic value and its extrinsic value." - Sheldon Natenberg.6 is fine, but why are you screaming?Without knowing the details of their trade, I assume they got IV crushed.Bc many variables hard, black and white picture easyIt did not :/I should've said a table of IV that I can export.Finally! Someone who says, "Put simply" and actually explains it that way. Kudos, my good man.I don’t know why, on my phone and have no idea what I’m doing...  XDCan confirm MSFT has taken a massive shit for the past couple weeks now, expected to pick up after earnings but didnt happen.

In hindsight it was just overpriced and got corrected, but in the moment it seemed like total bullshit/MM manipulationnot sure amigoIt's a never ending battle, for sure. Just like "execute" when "exercise" is meant.My neighbor sold his first naked  put option a few weeks ago and made $120, got super excited.  Says it’s practically ‘free’ money.  


I pointed out that his downside risk was about $4000 (if the stock tanks).  He says, the stock will not go down . He is sure about it.  

Those options expired and he kept the money.


Yesterday he sends the screenshot of another put contract he sold for $900,  This time the expiry date date is in 2021.  


Sigh!It amazes me people are trading options with no clue what they are doing. Time to go thetagang and fleece these clownsThey are probably the same people who say “I bought 100 stocks of Apple today”. 🍎I was actually arguing with someone about this too. They had no idea what a naked option was.I like my options naked , Short ,and risky, just like my women
 Especially if they are ready to straddleA naked position simply means it is uncovered OR unhedged. People assume naked short, but that’s not always the case. But just like the long vs. short iron condor naming debate, it’s become religious to some people. 

In my experience, those who use “naked” to refer to single leg long or short positions or refer to selling a condor as a “long” iron condor generally learned options from formalized education or books. There’s a lot of foundational theory and context that leads to these making sense.Then what is it called when I buy options naked? 🤭I started selling CSPs on Microsoft last week. Going to collect weekly premiums until I’m assigned and end up owning a stock I was willing to buy at a higher price anyway. I’m not an expert but the potential outcomes are one of the following: 

1. The stock price continues to rise and I continue to collect weekly premiums potentially missing out on bigger returns had I owned 100 shares but still for a profit.
2. The stock trades sideways and I continue to collect premiums that are >/= the potential gains had I owned the shares.
3. The stock price falls and I’m assigned 100 shares at a loss I would have incurred anyway had I bought the shares to begin with. 

I’m bullish long term on Microsoft but being at/near ATHs, this seems like a viable strategy. Not sure if they are considered “naked” or not being cash secured for the strike price, but my risk is equivalent to owning the stock and it falling the same percentage if I’m assigned, no?Amen. Reddit is kind of where the lazy people go to ask dumb questions.One reason is to leverage cash more effectively and benefit from greater volatility. 2% up on the stock might be worth 10% on the contract price, for example.Naked puts ok, naked calls I’m nfwI got you covered broAm naked. Selling and buying options. Just don’t forget to unwind or close out, unless you want to be assigned or expire.He belongs with us at WSB just send him on over sounds like he qualifies for tendiesMaybe they were naked when they did the BTO? Neva know!Naked just means unhedged (delta); buy or sell whatever if you don’t hedge your delta you’re nakedMy friend still believes that shorting = buying a put. I've tried to explain to him so many times that in options, shorting is not simply buying a put. He still gives me look like I'm full of shit, so I stopped trying to convince him otherwise.Tastytrade has some real good information, too.

To start you could check out the Learning Center and take the free Options Beginners courseNaked refers to the absence of a delta hedge irrespective of the direction of the option.  It refers to being unprotected vs a move in the underlying which if you buy a call and the stock moves lower you are unprotected.Not correct. Although the term is *usually* used if you are short. I've heard a former options market maker I know referring to any unhedged option long or short as "naked".I am new at this. My understanding is you wouldn’t sell cash secured puts (naked puts) on stocks at a strike price you wouldn’t be willing to buy. So what’s the risk in doing this? Seems like a good bargain. You get a premium for being willing to buy shares at your acceptable price.Personally I prefer using the terms long and short because when someone says they sold an option, most of the time it means they wrote one, but some people use the term "sell an option" to just mean they sold an option contract that they boughtDamn. No wonder the people at work look at me funny when I take all my clothes off to buy calls.Don’t worry they’ll learn the hard way. 

Just like the rest of us.What’s the worst that can happen with a naked call and what’s the worse that can happen with a naked put? Say I buy a call with a strike at $5. And do you have to exercise it if you can’t sell? Or can the let it expire?dont worry. its not easy to sell NAKED options.. your account needs to be approved for Reg T or Portfolio Margin and you need to have certain level of trading expertise.Investopedia has been very helpful for me. It's we confusing sometimes, but then I find further explanations on YouTube usually.Just let them fail. That’s one more fish taking the bait on the other side of the tradeThis. 

I started to learn more about options. Everything was great until I saw someone (on Reddit) about selling naked calls. Curious, I looked it up and as it turns out, it's a very risky strategy. 

Correct me if I'm wrong but fortunately, I do believe a lot of trading platform these days put warnings and disclaimers on selling options.well if they're naked you might as well make them spread.Nah bro I’m ass naked on my toilet trading optionsthank youThere are some resources that refer to singled-legged trades as naked, regardless of whether you’re short or long. Basically, any time you’re short and not hedging with a long position, you’re naked and any time you’re long and not reducing your cost basis, you’re naked. It’s just unmitigated risk.The one good thing with Robinhood for beginners is it does not allow you to sell naked options, has to be a cash-secured put or a covered call. Not sure if thinkorswim allows you to sell naked options right off the bat though.Can someone educate me as to how naked options has the potential to lose more money? As long as the intention is to make profit selling an option (irrespective of whether or not you own the stock) isn’t the most important part is to not let the option expire and sell it to close? Am I missing something?I got a question about this: if I enter a call debit spread (also called a bull call spread) on RH and do not have the shares in my accoun to sell one of the calls, am I entering a naked position, or is this somehow offset by my right to exercise the call that I bought whenever I want as long as it is at or in the money?If some people did contact you to know where to learn, it means they didn’t even try to find some informationI recently had this confusion with my broker where I wanted to clarify how options are handled in practice with them. And then I asked "is there physical delivery or cash settlement", where what I should have asked is if "is there assignment or cash settlement", as what my counterparty understood is that I was talking about futures, where "physical assignment", means that I get the oil delivered to my backyard.I agree, I see folks confused by the terms often here.  I often think to myself that if they are doing what the words on the screen say they will learn eventually, this is the price of education, still less expensive than a college degree in many cases and a lesson that will stick for sure.Not that you are wrong and I agree with you but I think it’s more correct to say that it’s when you write a put or call w/o a hedge. You can sell an option and not being writing it.This is all incorrect. Naked just means unhedged. You can be long a  naked call or short a naked call.

And people should watch tastytrade to understand optionsThere is still a lot about options I dont understand.  

If say for example I buy 1 call/put contract for some stock for $1 a pop, for a total of $100, and then I sell that contract later long before it expires for $2 a pop...could I still possibly be on the hook for something?  I didn't write the contract - and if the new owner chooses to exercise it before they sell it, am I on the hook personally?  

Or for example if that new owner(party A) then sells the contract to the someone else (party B), is A now on the hook if B chooses to exercise the option?I'm using paper trading to explore Iron Condors right now.  One of them is a 3DTE iron condor I sold on TSLA at 1490-1500-1700-1710. I sold 100 contracts so my potential upside is 75k and my downside is 25k.  We'll see how I do on friday Naked and cash-secured have two different meanings.  Below is from the OIC:

**Variations**

A cash-secured put is a variation on the naked put strategy. The main difference is that the cash-secured put writer has set aside the funds for buying the stock in the event it is assigned and views assignment as a positive outcome.

In contrast, the naked put writer hopes that the put will keep losing value so the position won't be assigned and can be closed out early at a profit. This investor would have to liquidate other assets quickly, or borrow cash, to be able to honor an assignment notice.Your right. I have ThinkorSwim and share my tanker portfolio via videos to help people understand how options work. Today's video will premiere in 30 minutes and I will be in the chat. My portfolio has 1 option which is a Naked Put (Short) and the rest is stock. All my call options expired last Friday at zero and disappeared like most long options do. Check it out:  [https://youtu.be/lOwq6WXfGHo](https://youtu.be/lOwq6WXfGHo)

I have over 100 videos which share real trades that are "Small" with winners and losers for educational purposes..RH is a dangerous platform if only cause there is no phone number to call if you get in trouble. Thats scary enough to avoid if your new to options!If I'm nude while options trading, does that count as being "naked"?Great post. Also very good you mentioned anyone but RH is good (ie: don’t use RH)When you buy a spread, do you need the cash to cover? So if you dont own the shares is the sell part of the spread considered a naked option too? Thanks anyoneIs this (making naked options) possible in RH? I have 100 msft shares. To make a small profit, I sold 1 call option with ridiculous high price. For my understanding, this is “covered call”. So, I expected RH took 100 shares as “collateral”, but it don’t see any indication of it. 
When I sold put, RH took the cash as collateral (cash covered put)Really 😐As long as it's not your account they're trading, what does it matter? Trading naked units requires the highest approval level from the broker, so either they have a large account or some experience and they just got the lingo wrong, thinking any single option is naked.Theta is the only true way!People are stupid they sometimes think buying a call/put is “naked”. It’s like no dipshit those have unlimited risk where long calls and puts just are the premium put into it.I sell naked puts im basically saying ill buy that stock at that price. If it does not happen i am rewarded by prem. Its a bullish strategy. If im awarded stock i turn around and sell covered calls on itI you sell a naked put, then someone buy you that put. Then the buyer buy the naked put. 

The other way will be, you sell a naked put but the one who bougth get a "no naked" put? Think about it.

Anyways in my test naked are more proftiable dd imcluded. You need a stop loos.

In my backtests, in the long run naked>spreads>irons,etcI love short options yo had some bad losers but you win so much ya still come out on top over time.I thought most people say naked puts when they really mean cash covered puts. I thought naked meant you are borrowing money to sell - which is crazy afHa, there are tons of times I'd like to "execute" my options (out back, behind the woodshed).Ah yeah I see that one a lot as well. People who don’t know how to get out of a trade when they made one and then when someone tells them to just sell it they ask if they have to buy the shares. If you have the money to buy 100 Tesla shares why would you be buying a single option?And half the time when people say exercise they actually mean sell...My God. That’s what everything I read in the beginning warned about. Don’t get cocky after your first couple of winsNot a $4000risk you’ll just get assigned. If you don’t mind owning the shares not a big deal.Dude is nuts. I'm a big proponent of wheeling but... that doesn't sound good.I made that decision 2 weeks ago and couldn’t be happier. Just making back the money I lost before I learned that stocks do in fact only go up.Until your dumb ass, I mean me, decides that there’s no danger selling weekly put spreads on NKLA for 1 more week!Being a clown isn't nearly as much fun as I thought. Can I get jumped in to this Theta gain... Theta gang? Nope, I'm leaving that typo. Can I join the theta gain?How does one join theta gangThe best one I heard was “if I buy a Tesla call option at a 3500 strike expiring 7/24, and the stock goes to 2200 dollars after earnings, how much money will I make?”Don't you need a lot of money to sell options? Whenever I try to sell a put it says I need like $500-1000 lol, why tie up that much money for only a few hundred dollars on a premium?
Edit: genuinely curious, please enlighten meI have naked Apple stocks, they are currently down, what sort of options exercise can I make to gain a modest 30%?I would hope nobody with that much money to buy some shares would say it like that.I thought the naked option was that one Saturday per month.I like strangles and spreads

We're still talking options right?[deleted]Agreed. "Naked" simply means unhedged when context is clear.I like open/close for this reason, particularly for spreads and such.Call me one of those religious zealots, but diluting "naked" to mean anything not covered or hedged, including single leg long positions, makes the term "naked" pointless. Why qualify anything with the term "naked" when it applies to everything that isn't a spread or secured? We already qualify spreads as spreads, and secured as "covered" or "secured", making the inverse qualifier redundant.

In everyday discussion about options, it is extremely useful to distinguish a long call, from a short call that is secured with the underlying, from a short call that is not secured with the underlying, with the qualifier "naked". Naked would only apply to one of those cases. Similarly, secured/not secured would only applies to shorts.Monday morning?Yea that’s why this post is misleading. Not like if the  drops you’ll just lose money. The risk isn’t the money it’s getting assigned, and of course it could keep dropping but so could anything you own.What is Reddit? Can i eat it?Yeah.... dont remind me. I bought a couple Amazon calls  for October 2020 at the $4500 strike, after it had been on a tear for weeks. Set a sell limit at 100% because the math was stupid easy. A day or two later I moved my limit sell to +160% because if it made it that far I'd earn back all the money I lost not knowing what I was doing. 

It went up over 100% then pulled back and I cashed out for 40% gain. Had I not moved the price of my sell order it would have sold at 100% and I'd have at least double the nice profit I had - especially considering I only held it for a few days.Same. Only covered calls for me.Also to answer your comment about selling puts, yes that is a common method people use to buy shares of a company at a price they’d like to buy it at and collect a little bit of money in the meantime.In all of the cases I’m talking about they had bought a call option and were calling them “naked calls” when a naked call is an option contract you sold without owning shares.I sell naked puts all the time on stocks I never want to own. I will roll or exit the trade before I get the stock put to me. In fact, most premium sellers have no plan to buy the stock.Other than the obvious, that either your evaluation of "acceptable price" changes while the position is still open, or, while the price is "acceptable" it's not "optimal" - the risk is pretty much as you described. 

Naked calls are the highway to the danger zone.The risk is that you'll be forced to buy it at higher than market price if it falls well below your strike. Then if it continues to fall after exercising of course.I’m definitely guilty of that one instead of saying I closed the trade.Shit sorry putting the kids to bed and didn’t read your message correctly. Unless you sold someone else an options contract you don’t have a naked call. 
If you bought a call for a stock at 5$ the worst that can happen is you lose your initial premium you paid to buy that contract. When you buy a contract someone else sold you you’re not obligated to do anything with it. If it’s In the money(ITM), meaning the stock is now valued higher than 5$ you can choose to:
1. Exercise it, so take your 100 shares, this is usually done when the option expires
2. Sell it at any point before it expires, if you’re just a regular retail trader this is most common, as the stock moves above 5$/share the option contract will increase in value(you have to worry about the Greeks of course)

If the share is below 5$ when the contract expires then you just lose the money you put in to buy the contract, you don’t have to do anything here but hopefully if it looks hopeless you’ve sold already and recouped a little money.So, the option can be exercised without your consent at anytime soon as the stock is above strike price?$2000 minimum is all you need to be approved for Level 3 options. Takes all of 5 minutes when you open a new account.Yeah there are also now several people who have good examples on various reddit threads as well. Investopedia is nice when they use actual examples of stocks. I’m a visual learner so I needed those actual examples. For some reason it took me a while to understand trading strategies and until it clicked one day I just bought calls or puts and hoped for the best, I started out with RH so if I was up enough I sold, no trailing stops or stop losses then. I was still nervous the first time I executed a vertical spread because I was sure I’d screw it up somehow but I’ve found that spreads are perfect for me since I have a real bad habit of letting an option run even if it’s a super volatile stock.If you get assigned, you’re forced to buy at a price higher than the market (for puts), or forced to sell at a lower price (for calls). If the stock kept going in the direction that hurts you, you’re loss is the difference x100, assuming you exit the stock position. If you wanted the stock anyway, you were fine with assignment from the beginning. 

Buying/selling to close at a loss is a possibility too if option prices move adversely for your position.Assuming you’re not messing with me here... you’re no longer on the hook once you’ve sold it. Only the person who created the contract in the first place is on the hook if it expires in the money.No, you can’t sell a call on RH without owning 100 shares of the stock you’re selling.Yeah that’s a covered call. I’ve never sold a covered call on RH but I imagine if you tried to sell you Microsoft shares some kind of warning would pop up.He’s not talking about the investment strategy, he’s talking about people incorrectly stating the nature of their transactions lolA downvote! May you miss getting filled on your next slam dunk trade by a tick! LOLYour backtests? You work at TastyTrade?Right. Sometimes, they need to expire RIGHT TF NOW.I think it's easier to just strangle the actual stock itself.There is more than one good reason buy the option vs the underlying stock. Not having the cash for the 100 shares is not the only one, is it?Yeah honestly if you want to buy a share at todays price, selling a short term put option at that price instead actually makes sense. Gotta be covered though. Naked is dumb.If you want upside you're better off buying the shares than selling the put. Think of the expiration graphs of selling a put and buying shares. Your opportunity cost is the difference between those two, and the more the stock increases past your strike the more your cost. The market makers chose the premium such that you will, based on the expected move of the stock, have positive expected opportunity costWell, since March they have.Oof. NKLA is the WeWork version of Tesla.I wouldn’t go near Tesla atmLiterally can't go tits upsell optionsI actually enjoy hearing this. I might bump my premiums up.Because a few hundred dollars on a $1000 bet is at least 20% depends on what you mean by "a few" A few hundred dollars on a $500 bet might be 60-80% gain.If you sell naked yeah. You can sell credit spreads instead though if you don't want to tie up as much money.If you do it right the risk is very low and with the new influx of idiots buying options I’m feeling very safe. You “could” sell naked but don’t recommend it. If you do, create a spread to at least set a max loss. I sell cash secured or I buy 100 of a stock I think is going to move and sell options in the other direction. If you do DD it’s free money.Because the print.LOL.You mean options to execute.I’m not trying to be greedy. I just want to make maybe 30% risk free per week. What options strategy would be best for me? I heard iron condors are perfect!Wtf lmaoWow, no, I keep telling you it's only on Sundays from 12am-4am. That's what a naked option is.[deleted]BahahaYes exactly. I’m fine with a single call/put purchase being referred to ask naked. It implies open to the full risk of all the Greeks.I raised this point because I was trying to help OP understand why so many people use “naked” for unhedged long option positions. It’s a term that existed long before standardized options and has been used in various markets to just mean a position that intentionally isn’t protected from certain market risks.

Everyone assumes that “naked” without another qualifier means a net short position. However, it’s not wrong or unusual, especially for people coming from formal finance education or experience in other markets, to say “naked long calls” or “long CYZ via naked calls”.Friday right before close?That comment is what victory looks likeWhen you sell a put is always naked right?So to do that you ‘buy to close’ ?They way I see it, if I sell a CSP and the stock goes way below the strike price and I am assigned, that’s no different than owning the stock in the first place. So if that should happen, I would sell covered calls to dig my way out of the hole and eventually make a profit. I try to keep my risk to 5% of my portfolio value,  and will DCA if I have to.Very true. The only time I’ve used a single leg put sell was this year on tanker stocks when they were super over valued and IV was super high but I wanted some for dividends. I sold puts on EURN and FRO and for my cost average down under 9 & 7 and hopefully they’ll have a good 3rd quarter so I can make some dividend money and I’m still a little up even with the drop.This is how I initially understood it. Thank youSo if you sell to close there's no risk of assignment but if you just straight up sell and it happens to be ITM at expiration then you run the risk of assignment?That seems to be my big problem with Investopedia too. I think I understand the examples but if they'd use historical examples it would help.  Like Starbucks, 2015... they can show actual prices. If you'd bought this [option type] so you'd have gained/lost because the stock did [movement]Why would anyone wait till then? Do people really buy 100 shares? 

Doesn’t make sense to me. 

So as long as I sell to close before expiration loss/profit this post doesn’t matter right?Not messing with you at all.  Just trying to understand various scenarios.  I understand exercising contracts as well as letting them expire, but never could find a straight answer as to what happens with contracts you bought and sold (premium trading only.)

Thanks for answering my question!If robinhood doesnt allow naked calls then theyre at least doing one thing right for their user baseThey allow spreads which involve short calls as well.

I only mention this because I believe covered calls are a "lower" tier for them, so they may not be visible even if you can sell covered calls.

And for the OP, your shares were held as collateral although the UI does not make this very obvious.An alert does pop up. The interface won’t allow a sale of those shares.I not work in TT, but I do backtestIf astroid were to hit this part of the planet, that could happen. After all it's a contract in place.There are a billion and one reasons other than that. Also, if you don’t have the cash you should rethink trading options tbhOh yeah there definitely is but most of the time when I see someone asking about how to close the trade they seem to think they’ll have to buy the shares. If you have no experience at all with trading but had the money to buy 100 shares you’d most likely just do that. If you don’t have the money then they don’t understand the fundamentals of how an options contract works if they think they’re going to get 100 shares.It’s always cash covered “naked”. That’s all I do, don’t see how that’s dumb.I’m making about $1-2k a month selling puts and staying in cash in case we get a good drop/buying opportunity. No reason you can’t do both.There’s like 3 weeks in the last decade where they haven’t been “falling upwards” as a I like to say lolIs there a name for this?Thank you.  I'll execute and sell my long debit calls to hedge my naked stocks.Yeah but how many legs tho?Are they still called options if the seller doesn't agree with the spread but you still sell? Or is that how epstein got rich?Using an additional qualifier to refer to 99% of strategies used by people discussing trades at the retail level is silly. It makes much more sense to talk about "delta hedged" or "vega hedged" strategies, which are the rare exceptions, and leave naked out of the discourse for everyday long puts and long calls.I appreciate that context. I didn't realize there was a history to the term that predated standardized options.

I doubt that that entirely, or even mostly, explains the frequency of usage in the sub today, though. There are so many posts that start like this: "I'm new to options and I just bought my first naked call." It's clear from context and follow up discussion that the writer has no formal finance education or prior market experience. Which does beg the question, where did they learn the term in the first place? I suspect it might be in the Robinhood app somewhere, since there's a high correlation between "I'm new to options" and using RH.No, it can be cash secured or naked. Its naked if you do not have the cash to secure itIf you are short the underlying stock then it's considered a covered put. If you have the cash to cover the purchase of 100 shares it's commonly called a cash secured put (CSP) but technically still considered naked.I guess but you can call it a cash covered put if you have the cash to then buy the underlying asset at the strikeFor the average trader most brokerages require you to have cash to secure it unless your account is large enough. I once asked ToS what their margin requirement was and if I’m correct they require you to be within 2k of the amountYes, sell to open, buy to close.Oh yeah I heart tankers. I think you'll do fine. I have been playing them both ways. I did the same with Fro at 7.I swear they’ve edited it recently and included some real life examples because I don’t remember there being any a while back but I just looked and there are examples on specific stocks for some.They dont HAVE to wait until expiration. Exercise is their right. It can happen anytime before expiration. Some people click the wrong thing and exercise by accident too. 

Yes, if they exercise they intend to buy 100 shares per contract. 

Your p/l is based on the opening and closing prices of the options in your position. Stock price is just one influence of that option’s price.Yes, but spreads are essentially still “covered” in a way. If RH allowed naked calls and puts the world would burnI disagree. Options is the only practical way I can think of to turn a couple hundred dollars into a few thousand with an ultimate risk of a couple hundred dollars.Agreed, cash secured puts are safe. Think aliencj may have misunderstood. A common misconception is that cash secured puts /= naked puts. Covered puts means shorting the stock.LmaoThis hurt my brainI’m not saying it’s necessary I’m saying it makes perfect sense to me semantically. You could make your same point that you don’t need to call a short call “naked”, but people do.

What’s silly to me is to make a whole post about why you can call selling a call naked but not purchasing a call.Or you can be short shares and sell a put, which is a covered put.Wellllll, technically a CSP is a naked put. Naked means not secured by shares specifically, according to Investopedia. 

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedoption.aspThe minimum amount you need to trade on margin is $2000.So by closing to exit you might have to give up some of the profit from the original premium but it’s better than having to buy shares you don’t want to own?If you are buying strikes/expiries because that’s all you can afford, you don’t need to buy the option. If you actually like the investment and want to go for it, fine- just don’t come further OTM/ closer to expiry because you can’t afford the cash xtra premiumSports bettingDoubtful. There’s a risk premium most of the time that’s why “theta gang” is a thing. Generally it’s about the same odds, more or less as “practically” turning a couple hundred to a few thousand at the casino.Yea I guess a lot of people don’t realize what naked means. Like a brokerage will just let you sell option contracts you aren’t capable of covering.I don't think it's silly if the intent of the post is to improve clarity and reduce misunderstanding in posts on this sub. If we collectively decide that the definition of "naked" is under dispute, because reasonable people have legit reasons to disagree, *we should avoid using it altogether*, particularly when schooling noobs.I always give up some profit. I look to close at 50%, free up my money and sell more premium.I never hold to expiration.true, a better option is to just pick a cheaper stock to trade options on. I've had some lucky bets, but luck is just that, and if I keep going I'll eventually be in the red.Isn't that higher risk? You can put 200 dollars down on an out of reach strike price while the stock value is continuously moving, then sell minutes later for a profit.Yes, you're turning risk into money. If I just want low risk, steady returns, I can invest into ETFs, fractional if need be.Very interesting.... thanks for the insight.I’m not disagreeing, I was just offering an alternate practical method to turn a couple hundred dollars into a few thousand while only risking a couple hundredTrying to build a fence around a dragon I see, good luck not getting burnedGreat overview and example of the IC. My only push back is that this is a particularly important quarter for Tesla, as they will be eligible to join S&P500 if they report a profitable quarter...  I think this outcome has already started to be priced in, and miss could lead to a large move down. Best of luck!!Tsla has been known to move 200$ in a day, you’re literally going to burn yourself when it passes your high or low strikes because it either surprises with profitable quarter or it fails to meet expectations..... you are going oh 200$ wide spread no problem and Tesla is like hold my beer I’ll do 300$ spike in a dayNot nearly wide enough for my risk tolerance lolIt’s $TSLA. It would not be strange for it to go to 3000 or 300 tomorrow.This was very helpful. Thanks!I got a 1300/1295 put credit spread open. So this makes me feel a tiny bit safe.It's in the market makers best interest that TSLA does not move over $50-75 any direction so most options get their IV crushed and end up expiring worthless.

It's clear many people are assuming there will be a big move in either direction, and that tells me that's exactly what *won't* happen.

My play is I'm doing a 7/24  -1570/+1580 put credit spread expecting a small/flat move or downside drop.

2 ways to profit... Flat or downside move..  versus betting 1 way to move big.You’re a legend![removed]So what position did you end up takingWhat numbers do you use to get your expected move? You use annual IV?  1 SD move? because I'm seeing much higher expected move priced in to Jul 24 optionsIf there is directionality almost guaranteed, is there a reason you wouldn't use a strangle?do you really think it wont go lower than 1406?What app is that giving you these beautiful data graphics?up it goes!Anyone have a Tesla long call?!? 
I just wanna see oneSuper anxious about tomorrow! Got $2k call expiring 7/24... any experienced TSLA option traders in here?If i want to take advantage of the inevitable drop in IV, which strategy would be the best? I don’t have an opinion on direction and would likely exit position as soon as i make a profit.  selling an Iron Condor?Do you know how to trade a calendar? July / August is practically paying you 2:1What website is this?What is your opinion on utilizing put back-spreads going into earnings if you’re bearish on stocks such as TSLA and SHOP? If you could consider showing what it would look like in your posts similar to what you did for the iron condor it would be appreciated!This is great information. What website are you using. I have an iron butterfly centered at 1600 plus some shares. Let's see how it goesI think broken wing butterfly or skewed IC would work better in this casestonksold August 1100/1150 2200/2250 iron condor for $11.25 before earning. Both short legs were at ~10 delta. So the trade has a reward:risk at 1:3.4 while win:lose at around 4:1. 
Closed for $6.67 this morning.  Sweet 11.8% return on buy power over night.Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood regularly appears on CNBC to tell viewers TSLA stock will be worth $6,000 in five years. But meantime, Ark regularly sells big chunks of Tesla shares. It sold nearly 140,000 Tesla shares the first two weeks of July alone even as Wood touted the company. Ark did not respond to a request for an interview.

https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-07-22/why-the-stock-market-is-so-high-and-tesla-even-higherWhat are you TALKING about?   

The ATM straddle is trading for 371.60.   That's almost double your $200 expected move.  

You sell the ATM put, you sell the ATM call, the price is the expected move over the duration of those options.   This has been known since options debuted on the trading floor.Very good analogy..don’t trade IC guys no spread is wide enough with such high volatility. I burned my hands selling few😂😂😂Drakaris!Top Comment right hereGood point!how much of a move do you think?Given the pandemic and other auto makers missing, Seems like a HIGH probability they’re going to miss.  The question is, will traders care?Lol, it is crazy seeing those big numbers and still wondering if they're too close.You're welcome!If you don't mind me asking, what net credit did you get for that spread?[deleted]It would be hilarious if it didn't move at all but considering how meme and watched this stock is I would be extremely surprised to see it not moved1115/1150 put credit spread myself.Lol people think it will move a lot so it won't move a lot. IV is 200% on those options...you're pricing in about 25% IV.Yeah, it's strange how they present that information. They're clearly referring to the expected move for August 21st, not Friday. Not sure why they say "after earnings are released" when they're referring to a month away. Here's the expected move for Aug 22nd: https://imgur.com/gallery/hVQ33B2ATM options. What did you get and from where?we'll the August 10 delta strangles (1100/2600) use about 30k in buying power so that is a large deterrent for most accounts I'd imagine.iv crushif they missOptions AI3x 3/19/21 1800clolWell, the both do but in this case it's very binary considering it's Friday expiration, so not a vol play like selling IV out a month or 2. This is more, "how much is this bad boy going to move by Friday". As far as the difference between the two neutral trades, the Condor is pure range, based on an expected move that's almost $200 in either direction. It makes max profit between the two short strikes and max risk beyond the two long strikes. At about 50/50 risk to reward. The Iron Butterfly on the other hand is targeting a more specific area (and that can be adjusted). It's center short strikes are its max gain, and any move in either direction from that point the profits lessen. So the Condor is the more horseshoes and hand grenades trade, while the Fly is more precise to a target.Open a debit iron fly, or open a straddle and enjoy the price movement because win or lose this puppy will move.... alll that consolidation and short volume and IV will make it moon or crash...  

If you have the money a lot of iron fliesWhich calendar are you referring to?Options AINever mind. I clicked the link in your postThey are very clear why they sell. They have concentration restrictions. If Tesla keeps doubling they need to sell. It isn’t a pump and dumpThey sell and buy all the time. 10% of portfolio. Their is nothing for them to comment on.Did you capitalize “talking” to come off even douchier?I think you're looking at August, the \~200 is referring to this Friday.It really is bonkers. And almost like the earnings is just another day in the life of the stock.it works best if you leg into it.

After a big move, sell the first part of the IC and adjust from there or bail.Ur all in right?Why would you think that? Tesla has a backlog of cars to be sold, they are going to be selling as many as they could make, pandemic or no pandemicNoobTurns out an IC was the best play to make!1.30 I opened yeatersay+1 I couldn’t get filled for a credit today. Around 3ish PM. What credit did you get it for?

SO I just sold a naked 1300 Aug 28 put for $73. With a beat I should be able to close it soon, but may hold off until I get 50% profit. Hoping IV crush is big enough even thou I’m 37 DTE.I got filled at 1.30, I opened it 7/21What was the net credit? The current 1115 ask is $5 and the 1150 bid is $5.60.What do you mean I'm pricing in 25% IV ?

Either way it appears it's a losing trade, we'll see how it looks tomorrowI use the IV given by IB, and just the formula: stock price *sqrt(vt)

I got an expected move of 227 down and 265 up. Close, just wondering if you use a different IVThat's a good point.  I imagine there's better money to be made elsewhere with 30k worth of plays.How does a broker get comfortable with the call being sold naked? You can’t really “cash secure” something that could go up into infinity ...Could easily go lower, about 25% chance.Screenshot?LOLYou should have put it on at the beginning of the month or the end of June but you could have done a July/ August calendar and the vol was 2x higher on the front month. Even yesterday you could have done a small 24/31 July 1600 calendar and would have been green between 1400/1900, traded 50% less contracts

Edit: 24/31 spread closed last night 33.15, trading 43 now. (9:37am)👍🏻You left the short squeeze and potential S&P 500 inclusion out of your analysis.Its a tremendous risk..you are taking about risk more than 100K with current priceSupply chain issues.... Not demand issues.Why did you call me that?Well there's 2 days left, lol.1.30 I opened yesterdayYeah it's kind of hard to predict the price. I was able to lock in $1.5 between the two yesterday. I tried a similar spread today with slightly higher strikes and it wouldn't go.I mean you priced in a relatively small move compared to what the IV is sayingAhh yes, not too far off. I would say doing it that would net out a bit high overall, but there are various ways and usually in the same ballpark. These charts are based on live pricing of ATM options so will not show the skew you saw to the upside. But that is a layer underneath where you can see skew, here's an example in SHOP, note the probability of move on expected move higher and lower: https://imgur.com/gallery/FfCfB8XSqrt(vt).. what’s vt?sure, it could go to infinity the same way the world could end tomorrow, right?  At a certain point it becomes the brokers problem. 

The margin requirements for an underlying are all probability/stats based. Some brokers charge a risk premium on top of the margin requirement if you're trading in a particularly volatile underlying and others don't.  Take tastyworks for example two weeks ago they changed the margin requirement calculation for tsla because of the magnitude of the moves it was experiencing.https://imgur.com/a/l78lqo6

Have been selling PMCC using this.Sorry but you had multiple chances to sell leading up to the earnings call. Sell tomorrow at 50%+ off near opennice, yeah maybe i'll write one up on neutral (straddle/strangle calendar) bullish (Call calendar at expected move) , bearish (put calendar at expected move)Do you use them as your brokerage? Are they good? Their layout looks really nice.That's out of the realm of fundamental analysts and it is literally what's driving TSLA's price. That's why you shouldn't look at fundamentals at all with this stock.im saying in general.

have a plan on how youre going to execute your IC.

leg into today, if no down day occurs, have an idea when youre going to open the opposite leg.

or if the spread is doing something different than you expected, then you look to close and open a different expiration, assuming you still have the same outlook.Fair enough. As it turned out Elon had all those EV credits that he could sell to show profitability this quarter. It seems like he always got a card up his sleeve.True but IV crushOh, I was expecting a smaller move. I wanted to capitalize on the IV crush a bit.So you get the IV from the ATM option prices?What software/website is this chart from?v: IV

t: time in yearsI guess I just don’t know how they would calculate the calls margin req. is it based on buying the shares at that strike price? Or do they add a % on top of that ?So hold up. You rolled over a call from jan?? To $1800 strike expiring year 2021. It is been 7 months since January. So how much gains are you in currently? Per each contract? Are u going to sell at any point? Or hold until when exactly?You must be loaded!
Also, forgive me, but what is PMCC?Gained 14K last Monday during the monster rally lol. All gone now hahaha. I’m just hoping it will get another monster rally before Friday b/c of posted profit.I’m up 6 points on a call calendar with the stock down 60. Imagine if you had a month on thatI would say intuition is prevalent in this case than all the analysts giving numbers which are being proven wrong almost everyday. Captain America a.k.a Elon Musk is planning to make a lot of millionaires!I traded an IC for today’s earnings, it’s my first of these types of plays on earnings. How much time after the market opens will all the extra IV leave the stock? I want to close it as soon as possible. Thanks.I know lol, I was saying you were expecting a much much smaller move. Anyway seems it worked out thoMeaning the ATM straddle smoothed out over time. So every expiration is incorporated to create the chart.Options AII have no idea how the math works, but [TastyTrade has an explanation](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/shows/the-skinny-on-options-math/episodes/buying-power-reduction-11-20-2014#:~:text=If%20you%20sell%20an%20option,%241%2C000%20in%20a%20margin%20account.).Started with around 5K$. Overall am up around 250K before yesterday. Have rolled up twice. Started with 600c and then 800c and now 1800c.No loaded. I had TSLA 800c expiring January that I rolled into this. Just got lucky in timing. Hence having to use PMCC - poor man’s covered calls. Don’t have enough capital to hold 300 shares so using the quasi LEAP to sell shorter dated OTM calls to take advantage of the Huge premiums.Nice. Be careful with the 31st call tho in case selloff continues.It’s like he didn’t even read the parent commentThe extra IV from earnings will be crushed immediately at market openDamn I got 40k. What numbers can i buy to make money? Expiration and call strikes? I need to make up some losses of 30kSo what does poor mans covered calls mean though?What was short leg? Strike price n date?Thanks, good to know. I'll close it ASAP.So my approach has always been to leverage with LEAPs on companies you believe in long term. Otherwise IV and Theta will get you. Very hard to time short term plays for big returns. Once you have base of long term plays you can sell IV and Theta plays for regular income. So my main holding are AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, ENPH, AMD with either stock or LEAPs and then sell weekly or monthly against them for income. So if you believe in the Tesla vision long term buy June 2021 or Jan 2022 LEAP perhaps now 2000c. And sell calls against them close to IV events like the Battery day or Earnings or Production numbers.It’s when you’re long a deep itm call and then you short otm calls with an earlier expiry for premium. 

It’s like owning shares, but not!1950c and 2000c exp 7/24The delta movement in the stock may make one of your wings on your iron condor less profitable, if not a loss depending on how close it is to ITM, but if your wings are wide enough the IV crush should have you coming out with a a profitWhaaat? I’ve been doing this all along and didn’t know it had a name. 
Not usually super deep itm, and not usually more than a couple weeks out though because I will start out with one (or more) out of the money, let it go in, then sell one closer to exp.I sold a 1390 and an 1820 so they are both far otm at this point.https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/hcy0o1/why_synthetic_covered_calls_outperform_the_wheel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

I got inspiration from this.Well that's perfect, enjoy your gains!Nice! Thanks for the link!After all the TSLA posts, I see why you posted this. Good info.What do you mean we have to pay attention to IV and theta decay?!?!?So many “I lost money someone help plz” postsThanks mod. Wiki is hard to find on mobile.

Edit: thanks a second time for the other sticky you posted with the full wiki links!This lesson only cost me 18k to learnIf you're spending money trading options and do not know this you are an idiot. No offense.Lol. Did you buy your option before corporate earnings?Bummer... I considered myself a well educated individual with strong comprehension skills but I have no fucking clue what I just read lolThis is called "vol crush."You mean ppl go in their platform and see delta, gamma, theta and  vega displayed, and ignore all of that????????Saved this - thanks again!Lol when people ignore the theta factor in options tradingNice work9Lol theta gang always winsWould you still want to buy your contract at your current price?

Uhhhhhh only if you're interesting in making moneyBe a net seller and you would not have to worry about theta decay as muchPersonally I get a kick out of poking fun of the lazies who cant be bothered to google stuff, but the community frowns upon such behavior.You're welcome.The best way to learn is by losing money!There are plenty of ways to spend money foolishly. You can't possibly know it all before you start trading just like an apprentice can't know it all before he becomes a journeyman. Mistakes while costly, make you learn along the way.Ya but the dd had 🚀. How could I lose money?I'll take critique towards improvement.    

Added at the top: 

Every option trader needs to understand what extrinsic value is,   
and how it is interpreted (implied volatility),   
how it can go away quickly (IV crush),  
 and also it goes away slowly (theta decay).How long have you been trading options?Not fully your fault, it’s not written very wellA lot of new traders do not know what the greeks mean.Some times on shitty platforms it doesnt show that. You have to dig for itAre the ppl who write the contracts considered theta gang? Since they collect all the premiums and essentially win the money lost to theta?In my opinion this is just as dumb as the questions this post is referring to. Sure, selling for theta works if the underlying moves in your favor, just like *every other fucking strategy*.

The problem is it’s really difficult to make sustainable money selling unless IV is high. When IV is high, the stock tends to move. What happens when it moves? If it’s in the direction against you, you get crushed by delta. Your $30 contract price could be hovering around $45 for weeks, and you hope that it stops moving against you and theta catches up shortly before expiration. Where as if you would’ve purchased that contract, you could’ve made a quick 50% gain with a small move of the underlying.

Please stop acting like you are smarter or know something people don’t by selling options.. it’s all a net zero gain when averaged out statistically unless you find a tiny, tiny repeatable edge.what's the risk of being in theta gang?I'm joining theta gang today, got fucking destroyedNo!! That’s why I’m trying to sell it!!
😂From what I’ve seen on reddit most people are not interested in that, lol.Wait, I thought if you lose money you’re actually winning? Something about tax credit.Frowning with intelligent advice is fine. Lone frowning just seems mean.Learned my first lesson in FOMO this week with AstraZeneca. :) Will do my best not to make the same mistake again.Also not the only way!but it’s like becoming a welder without knowing that fire is hotIt’s like driving a car and not knowing how to change gears. 
Some things you just gotta study before you engage with them, and if you don’t, you’re setting yourself up for failure.I'm not that guy, but I can say, as someone here more as a spectator rather than someone actively engaged in options trading, there were several points where I was following, and then you mentioned some term I didn't recognize as an aside, and you lost me in those moments.

Generally, I got the gist. What is missing for me, as a newbie to all of this, is a clear picture of whether we're talking calls or puts, long or short - I feel like we're talking about all of those scenarios, or at least the long scenarios, I'm less certain about shorts, but sometimes you mention extrinsic value rising or falling, and I'm not certain if we're discussing calls or puts, and in the money or out of the money, etc, at any given moment when you're talking about how extrinsic value will behave.Agreed. 

In the end, if you do not understand intrinsic and extrinsic value, you don't understand the true risk in your portfolio.

If you do then you sleep pretty well at night.Approximately.....never. Have been lurking about for a little while and thought this post would be a good learning opportunity. Felt dumb after reading it and posted a comment. Judging by the downvotes, I've made a grave mistake, my apologies.Particular critique towards reshaping invited. 

 It was written two years ago for other purposes, and modified.Yes theta gang collects the premium and they win if the move is less then expected.  The expected move for Tesla yesterday was like 200 points so theta gang won.

“Expected move” here is simply due to the implied volatility.  IV is always very high right before earnings because the moves are usually expected to be relatively big, but theta gang believes expected moves are greater than actual moves on the aggregate and that’s one of the things they count onThe theta gang is more like insrance underwriters.Wow someone woke up in a bad mood today. It's kind of a joke. This phrase is said a lot. Sorry, I prefer higher chance to profit, low risk, and low reward strategies when it comes to options. I don't use margin or sell naked options. All my risk is defined in all my trades. Please stop acting like you are smarter or know something that people don't by giving a condescending, low-key rude reply to a joke comment. Hope you feel better today!The stock goes against you big timenand you have to eat it.You actually might have to buy or sell stocks at worse prices than the market, but if you're okay holding a stock you believe in, then you might sell covered calls when you end up buying the stock via a cash covered put.Oh, they might be interested, but qualified ? Most notThey deserve it for spamming posts.  There really isn’t a need for 100 posts that are answered in the FAQ.The market is mean, I’m just here to toughen them up. Maybe they’d stop HTZ stock if someone was tough on themHe didn't dismiss the risk. He is asking why it happened.OK, good points.  

Extrinsic value will increase or decrease,  
 whether long or short, call or put.    
In one sense it does not matter.   

The undiscussed topic is that the   
extrinsic value increases (good for longs / bad for shorts)  
or decreases  (good for short options / bad for longs)  
do to gains. 

It was drafted to be able to talk about all of those scenarios at the same time,   
and leaving it to the reader to understand how  
their position may be affected,  
since only they know if they are long, short, call or put,  
and describing that for four positions is another essay. 


I guess it would be helpful to create at least one example.  

I think the wiki page might be at maximum word count, so I may have to link to another page.Haha you got one downvote, Thats seriously nothing. I called someone an gigantic idiot for holding his shares of LK from $25 to delist. It was a few thousand dollars worth lol. The sub downvoted me to oblivion but I still stand with my comment. That guy was a moron

Dont  let the hive mind keep you from learning something new. 

It took me a few weeks to learn the difference so dont worry if you dont understand it the first time. Watch different sources on the subject and it will eventually click for you. 

Also, ask a million questions. That helps a lot tooBack to positive nowIn general, many sentences don’t follow on from the previous very well. 

For example, what bugged me the most was you would define a concept, then expand on the topic, then out of nowhere bring in a very very far off conclusion like “so beware theta decay”. Given that this is geared towards beginners, it would be best to keep it simple. 

Best to keep it in the structure of:
Options have intrinsic and extrinsic value. 

Explain very clearly what intrinsic value is, and where it comes from (OTM, ATM, ITM). Remind people the difference between a call and a put. Relate intrinsic value to calls and puts. 

Then move on to extrinsic value, and explain its sources. As soon as you bring in implied volatility and time value, define and explain those. Again, use calls and puts as examples. If you are going to bring in long/short examples, be sure to touch on every possible scenario (long call, short call, long put, short put)

And once you have explained the necessary concepts, then go into your answer to the original question “why did my option lose money...”..

Hard to pinpoint specific examples, but the best way I can describe how I felt when reading this wiki post is it sounds like someone wrote this on the fly in response to the question, adding bits here and there as soon as you thought of it. It feels quite stream of consciousness, and for reference if I gave an answer like this in my derivatives exam i would expect around 50%, ie. a passable response that ticks most boxes, but cannot be said to have been written clearly, logically, and coherently.Thanks for the explanation. I brought my acc from 1k to 5k in a month (buying calls) and thought I was hot shit, bought DIA puts and lost the new 4k to theta so I thought, where tf does that money go? 

It seems the biggest knock to theta gang is the “opportunity cost” of the collateral... small price to pay for safe gainsPerfect analogy lmao as long as nothing goes terribly wrong, they just collect those monthly paymentsI spend too much time in WSB laughing at it all.That makes sense. Yeah, I think one good example would help put it all in context."I bEliEvE iN lUcKiN" heres my shitty DD blah blah blah.

There was tons of that.  Thats why I dont trade these stupid meme stocks. If you hit a home run with them you think youre a genius, but you actually just got luckySee I did the opposite. I lost a bunch buying puts at the bottom and then gained it back buying calls on the rally up. Then I was like I wanna keep my money now, and was introduced to r/thetagang. Just do put credit spreads to start out tbh that's all I do. Stonks only go up so you're just betting that the price won't go below your put spread. Of course, plenty of research first.Selling a put is LITERALLY underwriting insurance for someone looking to protect their position.WSB use to be the shit. Then it got famousThis is really brief, but does it provide enough to help, in the context of that essay?

###What extrinsic value does to option value  

If you have an open option position, say expiring in a month,  
assuming no price movement of the underlying stock:   
extrinsic value increases cause near-term gains for long options, and near-term losses for shorts;     
extrinsic value decreases cause near-term losses for long option, and near-term gains for shorts.I feel like theta gang benefits heavily from stagnant stocks, it doesn’t even really have to go your way but just not go too far the opposite direction before a preset time. Only my second month trading options but it seems you can safely (80%+ chance) get around 3% returns on your collateral per week. With 10k you can pretty much make full time minimum wage job money just selling covered putsI am working on a tool to help visualize option prices, haven’t incorporated a way to show implied volatility yet, but you can see them impact on time clearly. Here you can see prices for calls and puts on SPY: https://priceprobability.com/plots/spy

BTW, works best on a desktop. To make visible and hide each line just click on it in the legend.(each line is a strike price) If you double click a line everything becomes hidden except that line. Let me know what you think please.Ok I’ve always thought of it like the only reason you would get the stock in the first place (to protect) is because you’re about to make your bet but I guess ppl who regularly own more than 100 shares of a company would use them as insurance.It does provide an anchor for the rest of it. 

There's a time later when talking about harvesting theta decay when you mention extrinsic value increasing - is this the anti-decay you're talking about there, or is there a normal decay scenario that will increase extrinsic value? I think that was the one that threw me for a loop.I've been making bank off TSLA. IV/premiums so high I been getting 50% of my spreads usually and close them within a week or two for 30-45DTE contracts. There are so many different strategies though. Like Iron Condors benefit the most I think from stagnant stocks you're mentioning. And check out the wheel strategy, sell csps until assigned then sell ccs until called away and repeat.>With 10k you can pretty much make full time minimum wage job money just selling covered puts

Covered puts or "cash covered/cash secured" puts?Hold up I'ma get on my laptop, sounds interesting. It is hard to use with my pixel, keeps zooming in when I touch. I'm sure you already know though.There are two ways that can occur -- 

Suddenly the market thinks an event may happen, or has happened (surprising economic event, for example), and that increases extrinsic value, and IV,     
or, in situations such as  before an earnings event,   
increasing extrinsic value makes theta decay unharvestable for short options -- which I ~~should be~~ edited to be clearer about -- (and also keeps a long option from losing value, in the run-up to earnings).I’m talking about the type where you have to set the money aside, the amount of the strike price times 100, that you can’t use until the contract is executed or expires. These are the “cash secured” type right? 

I’d love to know what the difference isT- is a little better since it defaults with less strike prices but much more friendly on a full screen. I am tying to get into covered calls and trying to think of a good was to visualize them. The prices are great but when you can’t compare to current price it looses some of its capabilities it feels like.Gotcha, that helps. Thanks!If cash backs something, it's best to say "cash secured".

If stock backs something, it's best to say "covered".

The most technically correct way to "cover" a put is to short 100 shares of the underlying before or while buying the put.OK, so you're talking about a cash covered put. Also referred to as a cash secured put as to not confuse it with a "covered put".

A covered put is when you short a stock, then sell a put against it. So if the contract is initiated, you have the shares to issue already. 

Basically it's covered with shares instead of being covered by holding the money, which is what a cash secured play would have you do.Theynare the same, just different names fir it.Thanks, I understand that shorting a stock is borrowing it and selling it at market price, hoping to rebuy it and return the borrowed stock when the price drops.
If you short the stock (sell borrowed stock at market price) how can you still have the shares to cover the put you sold? Sorry if it's a noob question, just trying to piece it together.Respect. Would you do SQ?

Also my other favorite stock SPCE next time around?whoa awesome workDude, nice work. I bought the ERIC calls based on your post last week and did really well. (I feel like I owe you money.) I’m in line on TWTR and MRNA and might dip in there too.  Thanks.....  btw, love the platform you’re using, what/where can I get at that?Nice work. Thanks for sharing.Amazing job and great info! Will follow your threads from here on out.

random question if anyone wants to help out

I have OTM calls for this Friday,the IV212%crush is insane i bought 20 contracts at 1.18 and they hit 6.30 at 10:30am PST I sold 18 at 5.70 each

TSLA was 1633  when I sold 18 of them all due to IV.TSLA then hit 1642 at close and the same calls I had sold were at 3.28.I bought a few more at 3.28

 so my question is should i rinse repeat this strategy daily(sell at open,buy the dip midday) with this high IV instead of holding for earnings?Should I buy closer ITM?on weds should i hold till Thurs or sell EOD WEDS.Any advice?I agree that the security fears won't have an impact. My only concern is that Dorsey is no Zuckerberg, he lacks that killer instinct - I mean, Dorsey seems like a cool guy, donates, cares about world peace etc.  That said, I've made $ on TWTR recently, but small plays.Hi there! Thanks for the great analysis. May I know which tool do you use for screening option activity?You are awesome!
All the research I need to do but never have time for!can you take a look at CSCO?Love the contentGreat post.Bro respect! You clearly are a Chad among us.Should I hold my ERIC 11 CALL from last week's plays? Or just take profits today? Sounds like you already closed the position...BTW thanks for the GAINZ!I trust your DD, so I went for TWTR $40C 8/21. Put $5,000 into it, so my exit plan is if the contract is ever worth $1,000, I pull out ASAP...not gonna get greedy on this one. Will let you know how it goes :)BYND has went below its 50 MDA recently. Maybe a better entry will present itself, like at $117.Holy fucking shit bro grade A work right hereDespite all the flak they've gotten this past week I have to agree with your assessment on TWTR. With the election approaching the engagement of users will only pick up. Did not know about the subscription model and NFL deal for live streaming. I'm in!Great analysis, thanks. I was surprised about MRNA, its been very bullish since march when it exploded from low 30s. Do you hold any contracts on it?This is great! Thanks for writing this upMy girlfriend complained that I was on my phone in bed right as I was about to buy some Twitter options at 3.25, when I checked later they were up to 3.80 and I decided against buying.  Jokes on meKicking myself for not picking up ERIC last week like I knew i should. Are you still bullish with where they are now? Your strike from last week is already ITM. Do they still have room to grow? I feel like they do. Seem like a good 5G company. Would bumping to a $12 strike for Dec still be a good play?

Also, TWTR isn't shaping up to have a good earnings report right? Think its worth it to let the dust settle from earnings and then pick up that play? Because I definitely agree with you that the subscription platform would be a boom for them.Locked in 20% gains today on TWTR long call, thanks for guiding me to do DD on it!Thanks, great stuff. I was regretting not getting MRNA $85c JUL24 for $3.5. Have you looked at SLV?You compared twitters potential subscription to Apple and Microsoft? What’s the comparison exactly? Tech and subscription? Legitimately curiousGreat work! 👍somebody analysisPicked up some of them Twitter calls me held through earnings. Went opposite of what I’m used to. We’ll see if there is any lingering effects of this breach. How would you suggest playing it with all of that about to go down with Congress?Twitter was just hacked internally, potentially exposing the world to verified tweets that could have manipulated markets, as well as left society unhinged if they had posted something truly crazy from Obama’s account. I’ll pass on going long Twitter rn.Just posting to see how poorly the $MRNA DD ages after tomorrow's drump pumpPlaying a bunch of tech calls for right after earnings including, zm, net, fstly, ddog, docu

🚀 Check out my portfolio on r/tradehoot ->  https://tradehoot.com/bfc0b1f1Boring but would like to hear your input on long calls on $GE and $gldIf you aren’t invested in $OPK , $ECOM , $CWH , $GRVY , $SE , $NTLA , $UPWK AND $WWR CALLS THAN GO TO BED.I built a platform to do this research. Check out my profile pinned post. Releasing it this weekIt's TradingViewI built FindMarketPlays, check my profileAgreed, great research I'm too lazy to track! Thanks so much for this. Love it, especially the TWTR. Some [unusual options movement](https://unusualwhales.com/alerts/5628736c-23be-4c02-945f-e9d9e274a8ee) agrees with your indepth analysis, given the recent calls for longterm plays (and how despite the recent hack, no put really printed).I like that you have a strategy going into the trade. A lot of people don’t. Keep me updatedI bought 1 contract 40c 8/21 @ 1.88I can see that I feel $110 for some reason definitely is going to go up in the next couple weeks.

CAKE DAY!She’s paying for dinner for the next monthSaaS for AAPL: Apple TV, Apple Music

SaaS for MSFT: Office Suite, Xbox Gold

SaaS for TWTR: Subscribe to Content Creation, like TwitchExpiration?It's election season dawggy. If it dips this week I'd go inSuh-weet.  Sign me up! (Commented on the profile post too).I use tradingview to pull the data I want and cut the noise. Check my profileHaha unfortunately I had to learn the hard way. Put $10k into NFLX calls and was up +$10k but I got greedy and didn't sell cause I wanted more money. Ended up losing not only that 10k in gains, but the original 10k investment. So basically 20,000 gone in a couple of days when Netflix shot down to $490 from $570 out of no where. I know how volatile these stocks are so 20% gain is more than enough for me.Nice! So either sell right before earnings, Thursday EOD (to avoid IV crush and inevitable earnings sell-off), or hold until August when it will most definitely hit 40.  And dont get greedy. GL!Gotcha, I don’t agree with the link exactly since apple and Microsoft subs are on a totally different level but do think twitters will make a difference for themHow did you fare? 😎Wow, thanks for that advice. I have no idea what Im doing but atleast this is all a learning experience. Good luck to the both of us!Twitter has an massive reach + built in viral loop. It would be insane for content creators to not switch to Twitter’s platform. This means noteworthy early adopters, bringing in direct subscription revenue (taking a % of every transaction), plus more engagement + time spent on the app means higher value users in terms of advertisers.Sold at the high of around $2300, thanks again man :)Ill take my 10% feebuy the dipexact vertical spreads to execute, may be as an example?and it tanked :(My Microsoft Calls 

RIPNoob here. I have a $197.5 call expiring 8/14. Decided to hold through earnings and now I'm down 27%. Should I hang on or cut my losses?Does it make sense to buy a 212.5 8/28 call?No offence, isn't this self promotion? Seeing so much of this on r/options now!I'm in for a MSFT long verticle 205/212.5 C for $330.
I'm currently going to buy back my short for a limit order at $420.Come hang with us as we trade the market open!  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnMl3KU1N0I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnMl3KU1N0I)Sold a bunch of wide vertical puts today, I've been watching MSFT closely and have faith the $200 resistance is too strong to break without a breakdown in fundamentals.So I  bought a long vertical 205/212.5 C for 3.30. Then I bought back the short for $4.30, so a total of $770 for the MSFT 205C. I'm going to need MSFT to move up lol.Long term option timeFucking Microsoft and all tech stocks took a dump. I had MSFT and they are Resting In Poverty now... FML.anyone jump on in this?This seems a good startMSFT 200/205 08/21 bull call spread @ 2.5 limitI added 69 more Microsoft shares today at close to my portfolio. 

Hard to resist a 4.20% dip on a blue chip.So you are saying it might go up or it might go down?Just stop dudeBuy MSFT any timeGive it a few days. Also almost everything is down right now because of the new unemployment numbers. Patience, young padawanYour theta should be fairly low since you're ITM, depends on your risk tolerance, but that's plenty of time to bounce back for the stock itself. You probably got IV crushed and also MSFT is down quite a bit so you're probably getting beat up cuz of that. Depends on your personal risk tolerance and pretty much your intuition for how MSFT will perform in the next three weeks, but I would check your breakeven and see how much movement you need to get there.Hold. That’s so deep in the money you have nothing to worry about barring Bill Gates tweeting the N word or changing genders or something. It’ll bounce back up in no time at all, probably beyond the 215 it hit during its last run.I like it. Would look for a quick out if we recover fast though.Probably pretty safe. Microsoft has closed the gap from 204-212 in a matter of hours in the past. All you need is a good green dayThe shoutout to the discord server is against the Subreddit rules it would seem, but I think the post in general is pretty good and informative, so mod team may have not taken it down since you lose a good post for a referral at the bottom?It's a fair question, and if the mods have an issue with linking to another subreddit I'm trying to grow, then I'm happy to leave out the link. 

Because linking to other subreddits isn't explicitly against rule #10, I reason it's a "grey area" that I'm not looking to abuse. After all, I'm not asking people to hand me money, just providing a place where I post trades.

Cheers.How much movement do you need to make $450?  I always wondered at what point buying back the short is the smart move.

If your max gains on the spread is 7.50-3.50 = 4.50  and now after you buy back the short you’re at a debit of $775 + $445 to match your spreads max gain = $1225.  So if you can close the call at anything greater than 12.25 you’ve made more than the original spread would have gotten you.  Am I understand this right?50% MSFT, 50% JNJ.That’s my plan it’s 208 and some change but I think Ill buy some call on Friday and give a week to climb back upYeah, Microsoft doesn't "tank". Patience.Yup, entire market is down, so it's not Microsoft specific. 

If you have a (long) naked call, just sell a call expiring next week (or even tomorrow if you're feeling it) to make up for some of the temporary loss. That'll essentially turn it into a diagonal, buying you some extra time.>everything is down right now because of the new unemployment numbers

I was wondering why everything was down. Thanks for answering it.really?  That is what cnbc is telling people, but did the numbers matter any other week?  Maybe theres more at play here than one single headline.  How about the flows of other markets?  Metals on fire, bonds on fire, dollar in the dumpster.... hmm maybe not actually good risk/reward holding huge overvalued mega caps at this point in the race.  Anyone watching flows will notice the rotation out of tech.  I wouldn't blame MSFT's drop purely on unemployment numbers.the unemployment numbers aren't going to get better soon

permanent closures and layoffs are risingLmaoooo today it got decimatedthanks for your advice, my breakeven is at 212.80 but i think i can recoup at least some of my losses by holding until the dump is over. i meant to sell before close yesterday but forgot! 💀 expensive lesson to set a damn alarmMy god, Gates tweeting the N word would be so 2020.Recover fast? Wouldn’t the stock going back up make the call profit?Even if I didn't link to a Discord server, you're probably right  so I removed it :)and 100% TSLASounds good. I bought a 207.5/212.5 call spread at market open expiring about a month from now. Might sound fairly conservative but I already have plenty more exposure to MSFT with some options in other ETFs😅Not entirely true for Microsoft since the Azure numbers were less than expected. 

Still it’s my biggest holding (buy and hold, not options).Triggered a sell-off. I think that it will bounce back in a few days.RemindMe! 2 WeeksYes. It's down 4% on the day. That's what I mean by recover.What is the discord server?200% portfolio...Love me some marginsI bought calls this morning after open. Getting wrecked right now but I expect it to recover tomorrow or next weekthe only thing selling off heavily today was tech.  You guys can blame unemployment numbers but they haven't mattered any other week.  This is rotation away from overvalued risk.There is a 18 hour delay fetching comments.

|-|-|-|-|right, so why would I want a quick out? as in look for a day trade? Sorry i'm a bit new and not understanding entirely. My thought are buying it now while its down making the contract cheaper would be a good play seeing as thought it's probably going to be back on the way to 212. are you saying theta might crush the premium?I’d also like to know.[https://discord.gg/rjRypxS](https://discord.gg/rjRypxS) \- I'm still working on the code for the CAPTCHA bot so please be nice :)Dont they have a PR release in like 7 minutes?It always likes to dip around lunch time and go back up around 2 if you’re looking to scalphttps://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html

Go there and put in your trade. And recognize how fast it begins to decay.[https://discord.gg/rjRypxS](https://discord.gg/rjRypxS) \- Cheers!I’m down like 20%. If I’m scalping, it’ll be scalping losses lol.always forget about that site. thanks.How are you down 20% on Microsoft?I bought it this morning lol

Was down 28% at its worst earlier. Right now is down 23%

8/21 215c (bought when it was 209)10:4. It's MSFT, it'll go back up.I didn’t think it’d go down this big though damn.Exactly bro# This is exactly the DD I was looking for.i personally think they’ll beat it but the insider selling worries me too much. I mean they know more than we doThis is great, thank you!Played it safe with condors, 7/24 30/31/20/19.5. Going to be an easy 12% ROCHave some January 30 Calls on SNAP. IMO, has done some great things and negative attitude towards TikTok, will do wellRip SNAPPosts like this are what I thought the sub would be.  Would be awesome. But as always, due diligenceI have a 28$ call that expiries this Friday. Not sure if I should sell for a loss today before earnings or hold on. I always hear people say "never hold through earnings" but I'd like to be bullish on this. Any advice?

(Sorry if this is a basic question - still getting my feet wet with options!)Absolute legend, I was thinking to do a 1SD straddle position on this and never thought an iron condor. Great post all around man. Hopefully I can provide something like this on a stock in the future for everyone. 

Win or lose, great job overallWrong strat imo. Sell a calendar[removed]Snap 23 puts in Aug babySelling 7/24/20 22.50/19.50 put spreads.

$57 credit and $243 (300 - 57)  total risk for 1 option contract, making it potentially 23.4% return for 1 trade ending this week. Stock would have to fall roughly 10% to be at risk.Where do you find out the expected moves? Or how?May I ask how is expected change calculated?Loaded up on some diagonals and calendars for it with a break even at 20;30 yet I’m still not sure whether I’m comfortable with that lmaoExcellent post, thanks.You basically said "this stonk can go up or down, heres how you can make money if it goes up, or down"

this is wallstreetbets i expect a tldr with the exact options to buy to get these tendies#Beeg BRRRRRHow’s the trade going?Sell. IV crush tomorrow will be brutal even if stock explodes.Yeah, not sure where they got their 20.3% expected move from? They may have accidentally  been looking at August?. Aug 25 straddle is about 5.10.This trade needs an 80% prob of profit to be a “profitable” trade just FYIReplying to my own comment. SNAP quarter was bad but not bad enough to hit $22.5 yet. My impression is after hours reaction tends to be overblown and stock will not be as bad come tomorrow but we'll see. I am not too worried to be honest.the charts are from Options AIMove over to ToS or TW brokerage. They show it right there on the option chain.From ATM options through time, so will change with changes in IV. IV goes up expected move will expand and contract if IV falls. You can also see changes in IV/Expected move around events like this NVDA chart expanding around its earnings: https://imgur.com/gallery/bg7m7GnI think the last earnings the expected move was similar and it had that 37% day, but the set-up now is quite different than in April so who knows, my guess is that doesn't repeat.is it?I mean I’m 15% away from my bottom strike so it’s greatUpdate: down ~6% post earnings. Glad I sold :) Will be buying back tomorrow after IV has settled to average cost down. And likely closer to the money.Can you explain?yeah but only for 1 expiry dateThank youYep that’s the only reason idk how I feel about the expected move vs. what the realized one will be but fun play neverthelessGood callOh. How did I get here. I thought this post seemed unusual 😂🤣🤣Might creep back up tomorrow. I was waiting for an earnings dip.He is risking 243 dollars to win 57 dollars. Let’s use round numbers for now and say he’s risking 240 to win 60. 

That means that for every 4 wins he places, 1 loss could wipe those profits out. 4 x 60 = 240. 240 is max loss on the trade. 

That means he needs the trade to work out more than 4/5 times in order to for the trade to be “profitable” (more so make the risk commensurate to the reward). 

4/5=80%

So in reality he needs the probability to be >80% to actually profit.

You can figure this out easily by taking the max loss, and dividing it by the width of the spread (well width of spread x 100). In this case the width was 3.

243/300 = 81% so this trade needs to be successful 81% of the time to be worth the risk.LolYeah my condors yielded 20% this morning at open which was great, considering I had chosen such wide strikes.Ahhh got it. I was confused but that makes perfect sense now, I really appreciate the response!CongratsAnd a sidenote on the efficiency of options, the trade is roughly 81% probability. The 22 puts (his breakeven is 21.93) went out at about 20 deltas, 22 calls 80 deltas.Looks like a lot of work, awesome info though.   Will look at it closer on Monday.  Thanks!This is good stuff. Don’t know what tools you’ve been using but can you include IV Percentile? Always been a good study in TOS that looks at current IV relative to all historical IVs of the underlying and might help make a better decision on whether an IC is the best play to run. Nice workTSLA would look like a good play if you get a good fill. Possible to leg into this on Wednesday to make up the difference in bid ask?going to play all of these on paper 

nice workI was assigned 100 shares of MSFT on Friday that I wanna sell covered calls on. 
So based on you DD and chart I should sell the covered call 1-2 hrs on Wednesday before the market closes?How do you calculate "worst case" expected move?  Some amount of standard deviations based on current IV?  Or something which also takes into account actual moves last earnings?TSLA earnings can’t be good, can they?!I am blind and can't see your chart unfortunately. But to get a better understanding are you getting that the share price will go up for most companies or drop after earnings announced this week?This looks interesting. The vols will surge a couple days before earnings and the stocks will normally drift upwards. Normally the vols drop mid-day and then surge on the close/opening. Think about legging into the Iron Condor buying calls mid-day a few days beforehand and then selling premium into a spike in vols on the close. This will improve profit/loss profile. This strategy will require limit orders in liquid stocks and you will need to accept that not all orders get filled. But that's ok. Good luck.Great work. Thank you for sharing.I like the MSFT one. Was planning to do a trade there. I think a put of $192.50 is where u should start. That is just below the 50 SMA.Was thinking the same thing. Too many people are expecting a big gain or dropJust to confirm when you put " L114P, S116P. S134C, L136C" you are saying buy the 114p and sell the 116p correct? and for TSLA you mentioned the spread is too wide and you said you in a comment you would hope for a fill - I dont see a specific option for Tesla in the spreadsheet?Nice work, may I ask how much of the numbers and work you put together manually? And which broker you use? Because a 47$ profit for 8 traded option-legs would mean 31$ after fees at my broker :/ 
Thankswow this is great thanksgood analysis. Thank you.Are you planning on playing ICs for next week too?
I only did MSfT play from your chart and +$300. Thanks!I appreciate the great thought out work and am interesting to see an updated post/edit on how you did after this week.

IMHO, the profit is too low compared to the max loss.  You are looking at potential total profit of about $270 if all your trades go your way and a loss of about $1,000 if they dontWhen you are doing an IV crush strategy but leave out a stock with almost 80% IV (SNAP) citing "profit too low" as the reason, there's something off about the strategy. Just something to think about.I have MSFT 220c August 21, down 50% already. What’s my best move?Most likely we’ll see a drop for most tech after earnings as ppl will sell before to limit IV crush. Also the underlying should drop because beating the earnings is already priced inShort every stock into earnings during a recession works until it does not.You want to buy Iron Condors in JPOW economy. lmao. Using option strategies that are "as safe as possible"  is basically wearing a bullet proof vest to a knife fight. You aren't a hero if you send 11 dudes to a hospital. Charlie Munger called derivatives weapons of mass destruction. We use options to put BBBY in the morgue.1. If OP isn't potty trained, abstract descriptions of poo and the GI system to OP will mean he still shits himself in preschool.
2. OP neglected shadow greeks.
3. OP went compound without hedging even though he could have hedged. OP is trying to predict the direction because he didn't hedge and now he has to let his money not do anything while the market is swinging.
4. OP'll gain more and risk less trading stocks on volatility. ~~OP has created a shit ton of taxable events.~~ OP used the wrong options strategy.

If you look closer, vanilla options will be more profitable and less capital intensive whichever way the market goes. Trading stocks will be more profitable whichever way the market goes. The additional benefit is that hedging stocks is practically free compared to hedging compound options.

WHY IS EVERYONE CONVINCED LOSING MONEY WITH MORE STEPS IS SOMEHOW SMARTER?

EDIT: Ok don't just downvote. Tell me why my economic outlook on volatility and understanding of optionality is wrong so I can short myself with a stop.

EDIT 2: FFS. Okay. OPs assets are tied up in cash "on paper" when he could have made an entirely safe compound play with a different strategy. If IV doesn't get crushed, OP will not be able to buy into one of his 11 plays lmao. If OP's plan works, more than half his guesses will go bust. In no scenario does OP have a complete market outlook unless he's JPOW. Then there's still Tesla to contend with even if he IS JPOW. Anyway to dice it, OP would have risked less and made more buying vanilla options.Really awesome. 

I am really interested in AUY calls for August.

Saw a lot of AUY [here](https://unusualwhales.com/alerts/cc1e97d5-8af0-4f87-871c-7018ee0a2130) (image for the lazy: https://gyazo.com/17ccf236af4f460507f581191bd73a99).

Basically the whales only think this has one direction, which is up. I am getting in on Monday, as gold has been crazy up for the last three months, and I think the junior mining situation will just push this up.

Do you have data on how they've performed historically on earnings?

I think[deleted]Thanks for the feedback. IVP added.Yes, the bid/ask is too wide right now. I’ll probably create an order for it and hope for a fill.the IV is going to be insane and premiums will be way highLet us know how it goesThat’s the time when volatility is at its peak.I created 3 lists. Previous earnings moves, upcoming earnings expectations from MarketChamleon, and a list of support points. Then I picked the lowest and went to check options chain.I’ll do TSLA only if I get good fills for as wide as my expected move range.Not just TSLA, but any stock...

Basing an earnings play on what you think earnings will be is too simplified. The problem is that it matters less if earnings are good or bad. It's more about if earnings are less/more bad/good than the market expected. Also, in many cases, the market reacts more to forward guidance than earnings.

Tldr, will the market be disappointed or not is the main determinant of post earnings move.

Tldr, playing earnings is a crap shoot.My trades are crafted to endure both directions. Low delta on both sides, wide range between the short strikes, less profit overall but high prob of expiring OTM.$192.5 falls on the lower range of my expected move, it’s a good entry point, for now. My suggested Iron Condors’ strikes may change on Wednesday based on the movement until then.That’s right. I didn’t put it because the bid/ask spreads for TSLA are too high thus I couldn’t find an IC (based on my strikes) that is profitable. I’ll wait till market opens.How could I not do it again? Currently finalizing the new sheet. Congrats on that MSFT play ;)Thanks for your comment. I made sure to choose strikes with lower delta (high prob To expire OTM) which compromises the profit. In all honesty, I still think 1:4 profit/loss ratio isn’t bad.SNAP moved 38% in the previous earnings. Yes, profit is too low for my preferred strikes.If it's red tomorrow, double downI’m a premium seller, theta gangster if you will, so I don’t have much experience with calls. Hope someone else here can advise.Yea except the majority of earnings reported so far have  beat so...lolBro do you even iron condorwhat is the point of thisI can tell you with 100% certainly that you are correct. Plain vanilla options trading, buying calls and puts, a good CC strategy on your holdings and selling puts at certain times is by far the most profitable options strategy. My 25+ years of investing tells me so. And you are right, so many younger inexperienced traders put so much believe in these garbage bullshit option strategies. It absolutely amazes me.What's wrong with taxable events? You're not taxed per event your taxed from total gains unless I am missing something.

You're right though, this seems like a lot of extra steps for tiny gains. Can you give an example of "an entirely safe compound play with a different strategy"?Not sure why the downvote you’re doing what OP wanted besides #1 lol oh well.Yep. I’m thinking I should just follow wsb. I don’t understand the purpose or complexity of these strategies. Just go long and follow the pattern post earnings. Keep it simple.You keep saying image link for the the lazy, but I'm sure just because someone doesn't want to pay for an account with them necessarily means they're lazyThey're getting listed in the UK that might be the reason for that. 

They last quarter looks good as well so maybe an earnings play?
Can't find the earnings date though.Do you have a paid account with unusual whales?I won’t push it too hard. If I can’t get a fill, I won’t trade TSLA’s earnings.👍🏼This is great work.  I don't do earnings plays much, but your analysis has inspired me to revisit that using this type of rigor on tickers I like.Same question but opposite: msft can’t have bad earnings, can they?! Lol If so, the nasdaq will get crusheddddddThanks for explaining. My device can't voice out Excel sheets yet so I'm literally gearing what everyone wrote but since I'm blind from birth I couldn't see and was going a lil crazy hahahathank you and thanks for the work. im new to options - but I understand iron condors somewhat. lets say I were to be more bullish than bearish on one of these plays - would you then say put 2x the money on the call side ? (obviously it changes the max loss but would increase profit) or is this a completely different strategyEveryone's risk tolerance is different and I generally try to go for 1:1 or less risk to reward ratio.  Which might have more likely hood of not making profit, but the scenario you have shows a perfect scenario. I normally get out of my positions at 50% of potential profit, which if you were to take the potential profit in half would be about $135.  Just not worth the risk to me, but each is own.  

I personally sell puts on shares I don't mind buying at the strike price and then sell calls a dollar ahead of my actual purchase price(not cost basis) which brings the cost basis down 2x as much each week. In a perfect worldIf you aren't selling atm calls, your premium gains must be whackYou're literally saying the same thing except your statement is false. lmaoNo, I Iron Butterfly Diagonal Strangle, too advanced for you son :)Only on Pfizer. Wait why am I trading options of Pfizer?Don't buy iron condors. Especially not now. As long as repo ops are running, your ICs are fucked.A compound options strategy that profits off of volatility that doesn't require 0dte to work? The potential losses are way greater than the potential gains. His L/p is 3.6. He could literally put 1/10 the amount of money in, bring his l/p close to 0 buy deep otm vanilla calls and puts, and 1/11 stocks would need to win in order to get a ten bagger. lol

And if he's so convinced there will be an IV crush, OP can literally just short sell the stock, buy it back at the dip, and however many dozens of thousands of dollars he has will 100% generate more than 261 dollars???

Yes he will get taxed on 261 dollars tops.

My bad bro. I got that shit wrong.If OP is trading value options, then this is not the way.

If OP is trading greater fool options, then this is also not the way.

Super confused as to why no one is arguing how OPs mega IC play on IV is better than trading an asset, or even trading less risky derivatives, at the dip.True! Image for those who don't want to pay will be next. The twitter alerts are available without paywall, but this wasn't on twitter.Yeah I think it is worth it at the 20 dollar level. That is like 65 cents a day for an edge. The developer is also super active in the discord and writes/responds to everyone who writes him, so I appreciate it.

I'll probably stick around for a few months and see what features he adds (he posts his schedule every friday)maybe sell credit spreadsMy pleasure. Please share your ideas with us. :)The thing is, even good earnings don’t guarantee the stock will go up.There is a good chance MSFT will have spent a good chunk of change on cloud infrastructure upgrades as there platform was inadequate for the sudden uptick in demand.  Kinda like AMZN last quarter.  We'll see though.No worries. Happy to help. My sheet has the following stocks: IBM, KO, SNAP, UAL, MSFT, TSLA, T, TWTR, AAL, INTC, and VZ. If you’re interested in the specific analysis of any, let me know and I’ll write them here as text.If you’re more bullish you can go directional with a credit put spread or you can 2x the put side of the IC.Which part of my statement is false?So innovativeGood optionDoesn’t guidance sometimes have some impact too?Is that a bad thing?You sir are a gentleman! I'd love to hear about TSLA, MSFT if possible. I really appreciate you responding in a normal manner, most would just say to step up my technology or sucks to be blind, so i appreciate the normalcy.If the past does not performance is caused by a surprise that is not within the past, then why should our future resemble the current past? lol

He basically wrote short positions on every stock until that no longer works. So you basically wrote something illiterate back and got as many upvotes as memer go downvotes. U made dude feel bad :/do you think it wont go below 1240 tho if earnings badIt does but I’ve seen countless instances where the stock price doesn’t follow the fundamentals so I like to think of options as a math game.Just a thought.No worries, bro. Again, happy to help. My MSFT expected move this earnings is between 190.91 and 214.85 and I’m planning to enter an Iron Condor on Wednesday 1-2 hours before market close. The strike prices will be decided upon on Wednesday but tentatively I’m looking at L185P/S190P/S220C/L225C for a net credit of $97, max loss of $403 and a theoretical profit probability of 80%. 

As for TSLA, my expected move this earnings is between 1244 and 1758. I’m trying to find a good iron condor opportunity.Yea hes insinuating that people should short stocks before earnings until it doesn't work. I am simply pointing out that most of the earnings have beat so it might not be the best idea. If it works for him then all the power too him but in my opinion that's just gambling.Thanks bro, you're a g!But this entire 11 IC play is only profitable at 0dte. Going short 0dte costs a fraction. And gains exponentially. lolYea I may have taken his post out of context as I do not fully understand the IC as I don't use them. I'm guessing the same is true for anyone that upvoted me lol... so I guess being similarly ill informed is more important than being right sometimes. I still have a lot to learn about options but I'm sure he appreciates you sticking up for him :) thanksThe moment you enter a trade on an asset, you're immediately losing. The moment you enter a trade on a derivative, you're losing exponentially. Guy posted a meme and I wrote essays because of adderall. Trynna do some good after I lost 40k on Tesla calls. I'm sure as fuck guilty for making a bag killing BBBY. Those coupons were kind of innovative tech. Trynna reap some literal karma.Yea I feel ya, I did something similar a few months back, I guess that's how you learn as long as you don't blow your account completely up. I was long BBBY a few years back when they came out with BB10, huge mistake lolDepends where you live - Cali has highest tax on FIFO.Before the rules change IN 2011, not everyone was truthful about their gains. Putting the onus into the brokers and fund companies’ hands add a layer of protection for the IRS.

Instead of number crunching your way to lower taxes at year’s end, you now need to CALC your cost basis at the time of sale. 

For those that don’t know, when you sell a portion of the shares you own, the cost basis method tells the IRS which of those shares are sold. The basis of those shares ultimately decides your gain or loss for the sale.

There’s one problem with all this – your broker or fund company preset a default cost basis method for you. That default method probably won’t give the best tax results when you sell shares. What you may not know is, you can change the default method to the one you want to use. Talk to your broker after deciding which method works best.Wait wouldn’t you be assigned another 100 shares at 1550?u/vinny809  Seems you are talking about a credit spread that expired in the money.  Robinhood does not let you sell undefined risk,   When you sold a 1550/1600, you put up 5000$ as collateral and collected some credit. This 5000$ is your max loss, there is no need to sell your long term shares.  

This also reduces your taxes as you can write off a loss of up to 3000$/year from your taxesThe default is FIFO, but at TD if you setup your account before hand it will do LIFO.  Robinhood may not have that ability, but I would lean on the side that it uses FIFO.Be careful with options. DD.  I got in a hole with them. Again, DD. I cannot stress this enough.In this scenario both puts expire ITM so you would be buying 100 shares at 1600 and immediately selling them at 1550, and the question is come tax time will it be reported that you sold your old shares at a capital gain of 1250/share, or did you sell the new shares bought at 1600?

IDK, but it took me 10 min to figure this out and thus why don't touch spreads.I really wanna say don’t do it.I can’t speak for RH since they tend to do things a little differently than most brokers, but most brokerage firms will allow you to change the cost basis up to the settlement of the assignment trade (T+2). 

Keep in mind, you probably won’t see the shares until the following Monday (assignment is still “as-of” the previous Friday) and you will only have until that Tuesday to take care of the cost basis method.That's why traders should move to Tennessee.  Nice rolling hills, beautiful forests, and no taxes on your gainz.RIP my $420.69 in gains this year. Might get lucky and keep 1/3 of thatWhat rule should I be looking for to
Adjust?How can I explain this to my broker? What steps do I do for future sales?Correct, if assigned he can execute his other leg, and his broker should also automatically exercise both legs at the same time unless their RM is literally nonexistent.That was my thought tooYea if it was a short call he would have to sellThis is the correct answerWrite off your taxable income? Or straight off your tax burden?Is FIFO first in last out and LIFO last in first out? Thanks!at TD you can also select from a few tax havesting options, depending on your carryforwards and tax profilesI believe the net profit is $50/share so 100 shares is $5,000.  Depending on the state you would then have to pay taxes on the $5,000 to some extent based on your other yearly incomeonly ten i see is the marginal tax rate.Woah no capital gainz tax. I might be moving next door. Bye bye AtlantaWait really. Tennessee doesn’t have capital gains tax? Crazy. Looks like I don’t have to go to Puerto Rico after all.Wait whaaaaat? That’s a thing?No gainz tax you say?🤔Get outta the blue statesIf you use a real broker, it's  directly configurable as a default, and they let you pick which lot you want to sell so you can choose the tax consequence.

If you use RobinHood, you gettin' FIFO bitches.You must not know Robinhoodjust off your income.First in *first* out.Yup, you got it.  FIFO is the usual default for brokers.yes.Opposite. They would lose $5,000 per contract.

It is a credit spread so he was short the 1600 put.Screw buckhead I’m going to Chattanoogaha i'm in atl too and have made low 7 figures this year on options.. im so fucked on taxesUncle Sam is still taking his 15% at least but you’re not paying the state anythingThey still have long-term capital gains, but it's phasing out by 2025.  No income tax though.The feds will tax you, but TN has no income tax.  I don't live there, but I know they don't have income tax and are phasing out long-term capital gains by 2025.Then he’d have to live in one of those shithole red states. They’re awful, I know because I live in one.I’m in Kansas, a very red state, some say bloody. The taxes here are horrendous compared to Oklahoma and Missouri.Washington has no income tax.Oh right right, RIP opYeah sorry brain fart, thanks thoughBrilliant, thanks for clarifyingI guess the question still remains of how would the transaction be reported for tax purposes. Even though they would be taking a loss on the spread if I understand FIFO correctly then it could appear that they sold their $300 cost basis shares for $1550, and also bought new shares at $1600.well then in that case, it would be a net loss and then he shouldn't have to pay taxes correct?0% 15% or 20%. depending on income it looks likeTexas and Utah are dope. I think Colorado is pretty split in the nice areas tooYou can cast a wider netI'm on my last $15 to YOLO so I think I'm gonna research this and give it a go. I was gonna do AZN but everyone on WSB is talking about it and when that happens if usually means it's time to inverse.I think il do this MondayInterestingSounds good to me, haven't done anything with them since 2019 but got a couple hundred to yeet somewhere. Hopefully, it works out.Been on AUY for months now! BTG and HMY also good ones tooI'm in for $3k for 08/21 @ $7. Let's go!Ive had some long dated calls on this for a while.I’ve been sitting on the sideline waiting to make my first options trade. Think I’m going in on this. Curious how many you’re going in on? Appreciate the info!I'm in lol. I yolo'ed like 5 contracts hahaI’ll join tomorrowWith all the interest in this I’m considering a complimentary play of selling near term covered calls at the $7 strike. 

Seems safer than buying the call options. After selling the calls the cost basis should be under $6. If the calls get assigned you make a quick ~17% in 20 days or so.I’m in.  At prices like these, can’t help but to dip a toe.I have 50 $6C 7/24 for AUY.. LESS GO BABYFuck it I’m in...First options trade ever 🚀🚀🚀Anybody doing a spread on it?Anyone holding through earnings?so what the heck is happening to these?  Getting killed.  I read about them somewhere else and bought 10 bc this guy was convinced there is a merger coming hence the crazy volume. But stock price is up and I'm down $110. Fuck."YOLO" and "research" in the same sentence?If you think it’s going to inverse why not sell a put?**Yamana Gold Inc Ordinary Shares (canada**

Cash app/venmo me 5 and swing trade OTM SPY premium less than or equal to .08.For real? Damnit, that's my Monday play.  😭Saw a lot of [AUY here](https://unusualwhales.com/alerts/cc1e97d5-8af0-4f87-871c-7018ee0a2130) (image for the lazy: [https://gyazo.com/17ccf236af4f460507f581191bd73a99](https://gyazo.com/17ccf236af4f460507f581191bd73a99)).  


Basically the whales only think this has one direction, which is up. I'll probably join on Monday but ignored it even though it was cheap whale plays. Oh well.What would you suggest for BTG and HMYMe tooYou bought 230 some contracts of AUY?SameI’ve also been on the sidelines to make my first options trade, Going in on this as well...I just don’t know if I should do 8/21 7$ or 6$ callI usually drop $500 on calls that I'm confident in and based on what I'm seeing and hearing I'm gonna go ahead with this one.  So roughly 38 contractsDid you sell yet or are we screwed?Also my first options trade fingers crossed boyssameThey're a yoloologist.Are u a bot?Where do you get these alerts? Asking for a friend.I think BTG would keep rising it’s been on an upward trend since 3.00 I could see it hitting 7-7.50 after its last break out. HMY just broke out too but it’s gained faster since 3.25 I could see a little .50c pull back before better higher highs. Either way I ride the fluctuation selling at premarket highs and grabbing dips. I don’t do calls but I could see these as the same call set ups as AUY

BONUS: AUMN - is another good cheap one I’ve been riding -  since .35c and should keep rising till .80-.90 slow and steady gainer I’m going to pick more up at .40-.45 before it makes another move

Bonus 2: HL just got updated to 5.00 I can see that easily by end of July early augustWhat would the difference be if you do 6 or 7??Why are you so confident in this, can you explain?i sold my 6$ 7/24 for 650$ and flipped them into 7$ 8/21 calls

THough right now, if ur still holding I assume ur around .16 a option?Think it is on the service s/he mentioned. http://unusualwhales.com/HL *really* surprised meYou don’t trade options at all or just not calls?Precious metals generally become more valuable as inflation increases which we know this year alone is bringing a lot of.  There was a large volume order of 8/21 $7 calls meaning that a lot of other people think it will rise.  They have earnings on Thursday which most companies have a run up to.  Lastly, there was a large volume order of puts on another gold company which has people thinking that there may be a merger or acquisition which generally causes stock price to increaseYepCrazy day for AUMN, HL,HMY SVM, USASNa man too risky for my liking dealing with time periods vs predictions. I like to simply buy low sell high without time prediction deadlines. Tradings stressful enough without a time crunch. Not to mention you can go negative super fastI like to do both stock and options but my rule regarding options is that when I sell options its 30-45 DTE and I never buy calls or puts shorter than six months out. I like to give myself time for the trade to work.If you are buying (not selling) options then your max risk is just the cost of the premium, but I totally see your point nonetheless. 

Just curious why you are in an options subreddit if you don’t trade options? (Not trying to be a dick at all... genuinely just curious)Do the premiums skyrocket with 180 days to expiration? I’ve typically bought options with ~21-30 DTE based on potential upcoming news or when I think company performance/announcements will have an impact. 

I’d love to hear more about your approach with options (at least buying them... I stay the hell away from selling them)Cause I like to get a better understanding for it. And it’s predicting price movement up or down I like to read theories on it and look into other peoples researchYou have to put a little bit of effort into studying the greeks. Often times the volatility gets priced in when doing these kinds of earnings plays so it isnt significantly more expensive to get longer ones. 

The reason why I sell 30-45DTE is because about 20 days in the theta decay has started to accelerate a lot and their value drops precipitously.

Often times an ATM call for Jan 2021 will only be like a dollar cheaper than 2022 for example. 

Im not telling you to sell options if you arent comfortable but I would suggest you study Tastytrades material. It really helps making sense of all of these factors so you know wether youre getting a good deal or not.

Basically the spreads, covered calls and cash secured puts I sell finance my long options that I buy. If youre bullish on a stock for example, selling an ATM put is no different than limit order but you get payed for it right up front.

Before I learned this, I was always stressed out whenever I had options trades on...now I'm *very* comfortable. Time is on my side.* IBM (NYSE:IBM): Q2 Non-GAAP EPS of $2.18 beats by $0.09; GAAP EPS of $1.52 misses by $0.04.
* Revenue of $18.12B (-5.4% Y/Y) beats by $400M.
* Shares +3.7%.

Oh man I hope it'll stay in positive by tomorrow and I make $30 on my put spread :)Anyone else running SNAP?Buying calls on snapI buy any of these and it’s guaranteed to fall cause that’s my stock luckMy 117/135 strangle I put on today looks pretty good. Will buy back tomorrow.Any opinions on $sbux or $uber?Where can i find charts/graphs like the ones above that show the expected move of the stock? I want to use it for companies that are also reporting earnings but are not displayed in that post, like LMT for example.Y'all buying SNAP before or after earnings?what are your thoughts on twitter i already had some puts because of the hack problem?Nice. What'd you sell?Been burned by snap so many times I’ve given up. Revenge trading never works for me.I think they beat big. bought $25 calls last week for this week. cant see how the ad boycott of fb didnt get them a ton of biz in month of june which is included in reportRIP. how much was that lossBought Uber stock over a week ago and selling a $34 covered call on it tomorrow. Bullish on it heading into August.Options AIA wiseman once said never put Twitter during the electionsI took the exact opposite approach to Twitter and bought on the after hours drop expecting the hack to be shortly forgotten. I was surprised it even fell that much. The hack is going to result in a wrist slap fine and no meaningful decrease in user activity. In a world where a pandemic and business shut downs are looked past because “forward looking” markets I really wouldn’t be bearish in a hackHis prideAh I just looked at your post and saw the last time it had a -3% decline, so I thought there's no way it could go double that much. I sold a put at -6% strike, five minutes before market close.

119/115 Put spread, max profit $30, max loss $400Should have put some of my gains aside to purchase a ropelolWell done. Although that’s what they call “picking up pennies off the train tracks” haha.I sold a put the day before and IV crush gave me a profit, even though it tanked. Gotta remember about IV broThese small amounts are much less stressful :)Oh I just meant the $400 part! That's the train!I get it now. What would be an acceptable risk/reward in your opinion? I'm usually looking for 4-5x profit/loss ratio as long as the probability of profit is above 70%. This IBM trade had an 83% probability of profit, so even though the profit/loss ratio is 13.3, it's unlikely (3% chance of max loss).Why would you make this trade? Your max gain is $30 but max loss is almost 13x larger. Sounds like a terrible bet you stand to lose way more than you gain. Unless the bet is something like " you won't hit a home run in the superbowl" 

Yeah you stand to lose a lot of somebody hits a home run but odds are it won't happen.A better bet would have been the same 30$ on a bullish call debit spread. Max risk 30$You are thinking of it the way you should. And also defining risk as a spread rather than unlimited risk, you know exactly what's at risk if it goes wrong. What's interesting about IBM is it's up AH almost exactly in line with the expected move, which means if your PS (just below the bearish expected move) had been a call spread in the same spot higher it still could work out (so far) even getting direction wrong.Can I DM you about your script? Was it written in Python?I'm also interested in that script if you'd like to share.I'm guessing that the probability of success would've been significantly lower? The stock would actually need to go up in order to make a profit. 

With the put spread, I don't care which way the stock goes as long as it doesn't go down more than -6%. And there's a high probability that it won't happen.Perhaps you know this, but the probability of touching the short strike is approximately twice the probability of finishing ITM. So, a 70% POP (30% finishing ITM) would be a 60% POT.The problem is I use a nonpublic API for getting the option prices. I think the owner would not be happy if redditors DDoS his server.this is how someone eventually gets wiped out.  forget about probabilities of stock upside, think about risk/reward first.  as someone said, "picking up pennies"  you could make 7 winning trades of  what you list, and get totally wiped clean on the 8th if things go south.Yes! Great point. And the 50% is a good mental exercise to understand stock probability, as once the stock is there it has equal probability of continuing on in the direction or reversing.Lol. No that wouldn't be ideal. If you remove that API's details, I could possibly connect it to a different API. Anyways, thanks for getting back.You pretty much hit the nail in the head, I have a majority of my portfolio in BA and DKNG but mostly been playing day trading option with SQ. BA is a no brainier if you are thinking long term. DKNG is promising but I still worry sports will be canceled because of covid casesWhat makes you think Twitter will move to a subscription model? Out of curiosity. Never heard anything of the sort and I’m close to both Twitter and Square.I’ll do you you a solid boeing is literally a company you can play every two or three days. It bounces between 175 and 190 consistently for monthS. All you do is either short near 190 and buy near 175. Just set some alerts when they’re near those levels and see how far they go past before recovering. Been making a killing just trading that dumb company for the past month.Very good post!! Thank you for all the DD. I agree and more. Have many of similar plays on. 
Sure hope you are right about the online gambling legalization!  Thanks again for posting and showing some very thought out well planned ideas.Awesome DD. Don’t forget about PayPal earnings too!RTX >>>>> BA  

BA is a disasterhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bleachernation.com/sports-gambling/2020/07/20/draftkings-and-fanduel-receive-temporary-operating-permit-in-illinois-launch-imminent/%3fampI was bullish on SQ too but What explains Square trading flat for all of 2019?They won’t cancel sports, there will just be games without audience. DKNG long.Why not do a vertical spread instead of a straight call?Are you bearish on anything? Lol

I don’t like DKNG short-term due to the risk of sports being cancelled yet again. That said, I cancelled a buy order late last week and already rode the train from 30-40 earlier in the summer. It seems like the main, if only deterrent, is the cancellation of sports. States are going to be begging for extra tax revenue, so sports betting is an obvious choice, alongside marijuana but that’s a whole other issue. Tip: check out GAN - no position but have been watching since the teens.

Ahhh SQ, played options when it was below 80 in May, thought about picking up some shares but bailed. Probably because I hold a 2 year old grudge against them for giving sellers almost no recourse to fight disputed charges. Yes Greg from Sacramento who disputed a charge with your bank even though I have email evidence and receipts to corroborate that you initiated the purchase, I’m talking to you. SQ wouldnt even look at the evidence I provided, so congrats Greg, you got that $50 product for free. Grudges aside, most small business owners I know use SQ, and all of my music scene friends have the SQ reader for when they go on tour. Tack on the potential for a national digital currency? Boy does SQ look good long-term.

Somehow I agree with you on BA too. Can’t go tits up, and if it looks like it’s going to, guess what? Bailout! I wont be buying shares of BA, but seems like I’ve been waiting for the next squeeze past 200 for weeks. Cmon Fed! Give your pal a boost!What explain how DKNG has a 28% chance of being ITM in 6 months when it was just at 45like just. That's totally a higher prob play. Which means good trade bro I'm with you on all of these.How do you think NFL cancelling preseason will affect dkng short term?Well if they do get canceled it will be a great buying opportunity. The main reason I prefer DKNG over any other betting/casino play is because they are %100 online. So that means low overhead, and no real estate holdings. And with rona draining state budgets all over the country you had better believe that they will introduce online gambling.Read SQ section I cite a sourceyep! AMEN!! Long may it continue!PayPal is in trouble, losing eBay.I got RTXBoth winners, BA with more room for upside considering how much they’ve been hammered latelyIt’s only a matter of time for this to happen everywhereWith how many bullish plays I’ve posted, it’s time for a bearish play post. 

BA & SQ are winners.Not at all. I’m an avid DraftKings users and never touch preseason as most starters don’t play. It’s just not a good move if your betting good money.I thought it happened last year?Also BA has a backstop in their national security contracts. US government can't afford the loss. I put them in national defense category alongside Raytheon, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Northrop, BAE....For some reason the put gains from stocks bleeding dry feel so much more fulfilling than call gains from stocks mooning... Am I a bad person?Google PayPal eBay agreement expiringThanks for the info 🙏That was news to me. Just looked it up, and it looks like it may be extended but not as a primary payment? Thank you for that info 🙏Did you winselling naked tsla calls an hr before expiration. what could possibly go wrong ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯Based on the risk, this trade was terrible just got really lucky.Not a trading journal.  
 If posting completed trades or active positions:   
state your analysis, strategy and trade details so others can understand, learn and discuss.  

When did you take the positions?   
Why?   
Why TSLA?  
Did you pay to close or take to expiration?  Why?yawnhow much did you invest to get that return? Also what are the headers?Good ol max 100% plays. Yea!in situations like these- could you have placed a 100 contract order? or is it not liquid enough - I agree with your intuition I just wonder if someone could come in and sell $10-50k worth of these and get filledWhat does that mean in this specific scenario, regarding theta?I run TSLA options to expiry too. Mind sharing the discord?This is just taking a large short position in Tesla. It doesn’t seem like your profit is from theta. At the end of the day there is not much time value left in this 0 day option play. 
Most of your profit was from a continued drop in TSLA late in the day... if it went the other way you would have been fucked very quickly by gamma before you can buy to close your contracts. 

Not a terrible way to be short a few hundred shares if that was your intent and you can tolerate that amount of risk.You know what I love? A spreadsheet without column headers. The guessing is fun.Are you selling covered calls? How many shares of TSLA are you holding?Great ply budNot Theta.  GammaNoob here. How do you sell a call?Are you winning, son?Ya 100% won.You dropped this \

 [^^Click&#32;here&#32;to&#32;see&#32;why&#32;this&#32;is&#32;necessary](https://np.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3fbrg3/is_there_a_reason_why_the_arm_is_always_missing/ctn5gbf/)"Nothin" said the short sellers 3 weeks agoWhen a trade goes your way no matter what, isn't just some sort of luck? Especially with TSLA?

I though I had a solid hypothesis, stuck to it and came home with some cash.

If you cant stomach the risk, don't take the trade, but felt like easy money today.I started buying shares of TSLA in 2012, because I saw how successful Elon was with paypal. What I'm trying to say is I've followed the stock for a long time. Think I have a decent feel for it, although it is still wildly unpredictable at times.

I'm in a discord with some guys who were chasing TSLA all day buying calls and puts, but kept getting stopped out. So I thought about the inverse.

Looking for an EOD play, I decided selling OTM TSLA calls could be a way to collect premium considering how Theta would be aggressively gnawing at them.

First sold a TSLA 7/24 1485c first time TSLA came up to 1450, with the hypothesis that TSLA wasn't going to break the high of the day, nor shoot up to 1485.

When I saw the double top forming around 2:30 I sold a TSLA 1475c thinking bulls wouldn't be able to push it up any further. And it did stay in a downwards trend for the rest of the day. 

Next I sold a 1470c as the stock surged around 3:15 and actually collected larger premium. 

I also tack SPY closely and could see that wasn't shooting up so I sold a 1450c pretty late in the trading session because I didn't think it was likely to regain 1450 before closing considering how SPY was moving.

I managed them closely as was ready to buy back the contracts if TSLA started to shoot up, which it is known to do. 

I just set the calls to fill at market and they would take quite awhile to fill. Like over a minute, which has never happened to me with Schwab; market orders usually fill right away. 

I decided to ride them out the whole way to expiration to collect the full premium. Schwab always pays either night of or next day with expired contracts.

I understand that there is theoretically infinite amount of risk, but thought the chances the calls expiring OTM and collecting the premium outweighed the risk; so I sold the calls.What did you do to earn $1500 in less then 2 hours?He didn’t invest anything they were naked calls but if it went thru his calls he coulda lost thousands pretty quickly if he couldn’t buy to close fast enough up to an infinite lossWell I didn't really invest anything, just needed collateral. And the money just *appears* in your account.

What do you mean by "what are the headers?"Thanks! Feels good raking in the premium.Depending on the size of your account, the maintenance requirement of TSLA at your broker, and the diligence of the margin risk team at your broker, odds of you being able to put on that much risk is pretty slim. 

Even if your broker allows you to sell naked calls, you’re still limited based on the size of your account and probably deposit and trading history. 

I mean, you’re asking your broker to let you leverage your account to over 14m (correct me if I did my math wrong). 

His leverage here is about half a million. It’s big risk. Chances are, he has the cash to back it up or the trading history to show he knows what he is doing and that’s why his broker allows him to do it.It was tough getting one contract to fill, much less 100. Prob the most illiquid TSLA option I had ever traded. in descending order the open interest on the contracts was 156, 71, 134 and 1629 for the 1450. 

It took forever to get one contract filled, so I doubt you could get many more. If the open interest on the option is 71, no way you could get 100. 

I have a largish account and a good track record of doing shit like this that could blow up my account at Schwab, but doesn't. I'll admit I've gotten the margin call letter, but they never liquidated anything on me. I try to stay out of trouble. 

I often talk to they guys at the derivatives desk before I do anything I'm not sure of and get the green light from them, most of the time.Oh I didn't go to math school, so don't even know how to use a spreadsheet, much less what a header is. Sorry man. VWAP was prob the one number in there that looked out of place. everything else seemed self explanatory.He said above nakedI thought gamma was just a measurement of delta, and theta (time decay) was what was working in my favor.They were short gamma, so it was mostly theta.You can either "Buy to Open" or "Sell to Open" 

So I sold to open these calls with the potential for unlimited loss and max profit of premium collected.Always has been.Wait so did you just make 600k or am I missing something?what did I just read?You risked over half a million for 3k?Oh wow I thought these were covered until the last line.Thank you. Post released.This is not good analysis by any stretch and I hasten anyone reading this not to approach trading in this way.Aggressive. I like it. Too risky for my blood but fun either way.care to share the discord?See, this adds value.You got lucky.. go brag on wsbDon’t be that guyI won 7k on some pre season basketball and it was less than 2 hoursThan*Tbh $2k in 2 hours isn’t that good when you’re talking TSLA options$1500 in 2 hours? Thats what you earned selling Tesla calls? Think about how much money you could have lost.So I can tell that it says | TSLA (stock symbol EXP Date SP C)...then the stock symbol again....

What is the -1? is that qty you sold?
Is the next column the delta? Then after the price is SP I presume....can you explain the remaining columns please?He means the headers for your screenshot.  I don’t think anyone that’s been trading a while would need them to understand.How much in collateral is his question...Ha! I was a little sarcastic, but I’m happy that you have a strategy that works well for you. Best,I'm sitting on quite a bit of cash going into the weekend.I wonder if your trades were going through some sort of risk review/audit before going to market and that’s why they were delayed.gotcha -follow up question(s) - lets say I have a 8 figure portfolio with my broker - there are no issues about liquidity - if you were to do this say Thursday 3:55pm - obviously premiums much higher but A) to do them naked (even deeper out of the money but something in the .25 range) or b) covered - could you get filled for 50-100k worth?He also said he bought some TSLA shares since many years back.  That's why he's very familiar with TSLA.This seems risky. That true?Almost always do.Where is this 600k coming from what am I missingNa was just feeling extra potent today.Thank you. Hope someone can learn something. Thanks for being a good mod and making me do my homework.No offense, but I checked your post history and this coming from someone who ran a TSLA 7/24 1680c into the dirt for a loss of what? 12k? 

I'll admit there is a ton of risk involved and that did help inform my decision. But I ultimately thought the chances of these options expiring ITM was almost nonexistent. 

So I took on the risk and made 100% profit on all the options I sold. 

What did you scrap that 1680c for? A few hundred or let it expire worthless? 

I also took over 10k from someone who bought 2 1750c from me this week. https://imgur.com/a/kWWiE0CI thought it was fine. You got a better one? Easy to act smart on the internet.I'm not the admin. I was invited after making a few comments on WSB and thought I was worthy.Thanks. I can be a bit of a cave man sometimes. I've been isolating in remote Hawaii and don't interact with humans much.it’s too late. he probably watches himself touch himself in the mirror. sorry for the visual.I mean what kind of response did you expect from “yawn” lolYou are already that guy. Can keep your nonconstructive comments to yourself.You make some stupid parlay bet like Adam Sandler in Uncut Jems?Good for you.*theinI think you're missing the point that it was easy money. Don't be mad because you're share lost so much value today.I don’t really know how Schwab displays stuff but this looks like the screen shot is from ~15 minutes before the bell.  -1 is his position, then option bid and ask, equity mark, his entry mark, somehow his equity (.2*entry mark - commission is the only way I get to the top line number), his gain, his return.As in buying power. Yeah I’m quite curious about this too.Quite possibly.Nobody tell himIf you have to ask don't do it.Do you understand what a call is?  Think about what would happen if TSLA went up to 1490 by close.  What would happen at 1550? or 1590?  OP revealed that these were naked calls (i.e. he doesn't own the TSLA shares).Very.Considering there could be infinite loss, ya you take on a bit of risk.[removed]Let's see how this ages.How do you manage the margin selling naked Tesla?As someone who does the same thing but with Tesla puts, I understand where you’re coming from but those trades don’t fit nicely in my normal trade log.  Anyway, you must have balls of steel to use strikes that close to the market.  I go at 90% of the mark or my next current support level and still feel uncomfortable at times.Because you’re so constructive, right?Why are you so salty???Lol I’m just letting you know that your comment has -50 for a reason. Attempting to gloat with “2k in 2 hours” trading TSLA options is like driving a Tesla to a gas station yelling you saved $20 on fuel. It’s insignificant and douchebaggywow didnt mean to start a whole thing lolll i just meant that compared to your post history i dont see the big deal here. congrats tho i made $600 this week lolI know what the consequences would be, but my logic led me to this most likely not happening.  Couldn't give you an exact percentage, but after the  late double top def seemed like bears were in control and I kept buying more contracts.You even trade options homie? I was happy it was broght to my attention that I should explain my position some more, my thought process, so others can learn.

I really don't give a fuck about the mods. Ban me if they wan't I'll still be making money. But I thought it was a nice gesture. 

Why don't you drag your troll ass back under a bridge or something? You're contributing nothing.I run a quite a few different strategies, but scalping SPY is my bread and butter most weeks. I have a few other maneuvers like buying stock, swing trading options, selling covered calls, spreads, butterflies and trading futures. 

One thing I don't do is run a 12k option into the dirt and make a desperation post about how to save the position (because you cant). How many pennies on the dollar you get on that one, if any?

I'll wager I come out more in the black then you do next week, so we can see how this ages.Sounds like I had a more constructive afternoon then you.Just want to say thank you for explaining and fuck that trollShut up you fucking tool, lol.I'll wager that selling naked bites you in the ass sooner rather than later.Sounds like this is your first big gain since you have to flex so hard.Thanks man. TBH it wasn't even my most profitable trading I did that day, but thought it was such easy money, it would be nice to share. 

Funny when you look at these trolls profile and they dont even trade, just get jealous you're up and have to creep back into their neckbeard nest at their mons house. 

If your gonna hate, show me some trade that blows my measly gains out the water.Have fun vaping in your moms basement and playing fantasy football, or whatever tools like you do. Come back to the big boy table once you're ready to make some money and no longer have PDT status. Fucking piker.Actually, I've had 7 figure gains in the past, but now I'll flex that because you're a troll.I'm fairly certain I work harder and earn more money than you, but I guess you'll never know. I don't reference it constantly to stroke my own ego like you do. Really, there's nothing respectable about what you do. Even when it comes to selling options, your approach is that of a bottom-feeding bum. Why not get an actual skill and stop trying to finesse your way through life, you shiny bum?But yet you’re hard over $1500? Lol ok...How often do you measure your dick? The fact someone makes a joke and you get so offended shows how insecure you are. But sure, I’m a troll! At least all of my past posts aren’t asking “what’s going on with X???” then I flex my gains. (Also, you’re this hyped up about $1500 when you’ve supposedly made over $1,000,000 in gains? That’s hardly over a tenth of a percent...)7 figure gains? Dang..  still waiting on my two figure onesBecause I've been hustling and finessing my way through life since I got a job at 14. Do you even know that finesse means "intricate and refined delicacy"? So ya I ave a lot of finesse. I live on a ten acre permaculture orchard/estate in Hawaii. I have an thriving exotic agriculture/permaculture design and photography businesses too. Beautiful woman who loves me and a wonderful dog. Basically living the dream I want to be living right now. Trying to figure out how to feed Hawaii without importing food. A somewhat noble cause, considering how white rice and spam is causing obesity and diabetes at an alarming rate here.

Just because you lost on your TSLA call you bought and didn't know what to do except loose, shouldn't be an excuse to trash on me. 

The street is ruthless and gains are gains. Markets are efficient and weed out the pikers real quick. You really think buying a call that expires worthless is more noble then selling a call that expires worthless? The street doesn't give a fuck and all that matters is winding up in the black/printing money. I'm not having any problems doing that. Maybe you could learn a thing or two, because it doesn't seem like you actively trade (besides getting burnt on TSLA calls expiring OTM).

Maybe you work harder, maybe you earn more money (both doubtful, but I have low overhead), but I can guarantee my quality of life and happiness trumps yours. 

You sound miserable.It’s the equivalent of bragging about $15 after making $10,000Not gonna lie, this got me a little chubby earlier in the day... 

https://imgur.com/a/kWWiE0C

Sounds like your pulling rookie numbers in the racket.Yes, *I* sound miserableIs that a lot? Lol this guy gets better the more he typesWell you sound sarcastic, which is obvious sign of misery.

Be a proud looser. Too bad the street doesn't give participation trophies.Not really buy an extra 10 racks is always nice.That’s what I thought 🙂Basically the whole world is gambling atm. 

Scary stuff.Instead of stock options let's make option options! I'll place a put option for a contract filled by 100 previous option contracts of calls set to expire sometime next year. Quite the leveraged play, but not without risk!People caught onto the bug. The bug of leverage. The bug of probabilities. I wonder if there's any way of going back. Does this set a dangerous precedence? Do options drive prices? I guess to a certain extent they do. But I'm more surprised that people aren't trading options more in the past. It seems to be an excellent financial tool to double your money in a short amount of time.Gimme a B, gimme a U, gimme a B, B, L, E!Its crazy to think that there are some people who are pretty much take the couple grand they have and start trading options from seeing the crazy gains some people make. And this is even before they have a Roth or Individual account set up and funded as actual investments.

I can't imagine being one of those "Just learned stocks exist 2 months ago, I want to try day trading or trading options with most of my savings" people I see on reddit all the time.Notional value, not number of contracts.  But still alarming.The CBOE needs tri-weekly expirations for active underlyers, just like SPY.Sign of the top?  Sign of the bottom?  Sign of nothing much at all?Investing has become social. RH et al. Butterfly, Iron condor are fancy names / memes to throw at friends. Look at TSLA, NKLA et al emotional exuberance. But sad to see many lose it all , like gambling, in big fancy bets. I think covid stuck at home has a factor, probably..The power of autists unites us all!I am still waiting for bitcoin option contracts.Does this mean we're entering a bubble where everyone runs over to options like red rover and they all buy calls, but then realize no one is buying the stock so the stock doesn't move and then all the theta wipes out the entire economy?!?!?!!!!  


Puts on theta 1/22  
or is it calls...It’s annoying, driving up premiums everywhere especially on tech“Notional”HmWhat else are they going to do?

Who cares?Its vegas, on my phone, well insulated from covid19. What more could the people ask for?!?Lol those do exist. Calls on calls, puts on puts, calls on puts, knockout / barrier options etc. maybe you would like exotic options thenThis was Selena Gomez’s cameo in The Big Shortyo dog i heard you like options, so i put an option on your option so you can call while you call.Meta af brotrading commissions used to be a deterrent to trading...Also a great tool to lose everything in a short amount of time. I wouldn't be surprised if eventually there are new regulations around it as a result of Robinhood.Max Pain becomes more relevant everyday...If I could have afforded an education, I’d know what that spellsBro look at the questions people ask on this sub. It drives me crazy. They ask things like I just bought a Tesla call and the stock price dropped, did I lose money? People trade options and don't even know how they workBut let’s be real. A $6000 per year IRA in a Boggle diversified account will not make you enough into retirement. Further, wages haven’t increased in decades. And as the last crisis taught us, “investing” in a house is an overpriced asset that is anything but safe.

People go to the casino and play the lottery in the hopes of hitting it big, because their options are limited. The market is now even more accessible. You don’t pay social security taxes on gains, either.Theta gang babyDamn. You preferred when you had a monopoly yourself on making money off options, huh?Are these OTC products?i was just thinking thisSynthetic CDOsThat's the joke.Thank fucking God somebody understands. Also see you on the Malta shores. Thanks for offering us a ride on your yacht.That’s true! Now it’s so dirt cheap / free, you almost can’t afford to not do it.Like the minimum of $25,000 to allow daytrading? It would be interesting but only fear is this getting politicized -- individual responsibility versus social responsibility.Trade options. You'll get there little buddy.What is this shit? Now they want me to do math too????Exactly, I started with only 750$ in my options account back in April, but that was after I researched extensively and literally traded on a piece of paper in my office for a month or two.

I still made some stupid moves back when I started but at least I wasn't risking thousands of dollars on TSLA weeklies that I had 0 understanding of.People seem to look to options trading because it’s “cheap” without knowing anything about options. Many of them likely couldn’t afford a share of TSLA, AMZN, etc so they move into options from the start.$500 per month from age 30 to 67 with an 8% return will be roughly $1.4 million?

That’s not enough?I agree. I never said that taking calculated risks and gambles is necessarily always bad. At some point you have to take some risk with investing to get a sufficient gain, whether it's investing in your own business, real estate, speculating with stocks, etc.

 My point was people who don't understand the market and really don't even understand investing in stocks really shouldn't get into something more complicated such as options without an even basic understanding of them.You got him, luvsgiggles is secretly Jamie Dimon.It messes up the risk vs reward. Always fighting the theta burn too waiting for decent % gainsYes, i guess maybe CBOE might have them but to my knowledge you typically set it up directly with someone/a firm who’s down to sell them to youYes, OTC through a bank or trading house. Extremely complicated to hedge.Bingo.The brokers are still making money on those commission free trades. Ask yourself howThe $25k rule is pretty dumb. I can walk into any casino and blow any amount of money i want, while they give me free booze, but i cant take 7% gains more than 4 times in a 5 day period? Tell me its not rigged.Maybe they are selling $10 TSLA puts?A 4% drawdown on $1.4M, which is suggested for perpetuity, is $56k per year. After inflation, I doubt that this will provide a decent quality of life in 2057 (assuming you started now). Third world expatriate, maybe.

Further, I think an 8% return is optimistic. 7% is supposedly realistic, but I have my doubts, as investors are having to chase riskier investments to get those kinds of returns as the years wear on. Savings accounts, money market and CDs are out. Treasuries are basically running par with inflation. Bonds are nowhere near 7%. Equities are the only game in town, but they are extremely volatile as we know. We saw a 30% drop in the course of a month, and only straight printing brought the patient back to life.I don’t know why you hedge that position. Wouldn’t you only use it if you are getting blown out of something and are in fact using OTC markets to hedge something else?

I don’t know tbhCan someone just tell me how? Just by people having the accounts and access, I assume their money comes from the lending of the stocks being shorted?Unfortunately dropping money in slot machines and sports betting is called "gambling" while day trading and options trading is not, and a less sophisticated trader is under the illusion/assumption that trading securities is more legitimate since it's a thing guys in suits do. 

(I'm not saying casino gambling and trading are the same thing. I'm saying they can be and often are when the individuals involved don't understand the risks, or when they explicitly treat it as gambling like WSB.)The $25k rule only exists on margin accounts. Cash accounts (except Robinhood) can daytrade as much as they want with the cash they have, they just can't reuse unsettled funds from trades closed on the same day.25k rule is a great thing. it slows down your money loss. most novice traders lose money trading.That is for one person.  Assuming two working adults moves it to 2.8 million . Plus an estimated 3k a month from social security.No, these types of options are only entered by the bank's traders per client request. The trader needs to hedge these accordingly.

It is uncommon to begin with and you and I would never do that type of exotic simply trading on our own. It requires hedging along the entire structure's lifespan. Given the complexity of many exotic options and which underlying it is on, it becomes rather difficult.Lol no one really knows except the brokers. Most controversial way might be order flow sales. I think the biggest cost using something like RH is lack of customer service thoThat’s one of the many ways they make money. Another way they make money is in the difference between the price they secure and the price you’re buying / selling for.Are there really that many people shorting though? Not buying puts, but actually shorting?Im aware of this. I use a cash account with fidelity. I still think its bullshit though. I would rather leverage my securities on margin sometimes than sell them to make another move.It makes it incredibly difficult to take profit too. Somebody shouldnt be forced to hold because they already made 4 day trades this week. Your 401k is for safe investing and riding out the wave. A trading account isnt.you can lock in majority of your profit via options trade. then close everything the next day.Well, sir, this aged fucking beautifullyI'm waiting for MSFT earnings and the reaction thereafter as to whether I'll jump on AMD. Fundamentals seem to be mattering less and less nowadaysMy Aug 57.5 calls that I bought a few days ago are already printing...  Wish I'd bought more.Why did this pop up in my inbox as “trending”; is this new reddit shit or have I done something I don’t know I’ve done? Any ideas?What call price do you guys suggest I should go for this Friday, July 24 on AMDThis move today is hurting my aug 21 45/65 strangle. Hasn’t breached the long strike yet but it’s getting there and leaving little room for after earningsWhere did you get that calendar in the start of your video?"Fundamentals"? What is that?  

Is that the name of the dance you do while Daddy JPow showers you in freshly printed dolla dolla bills?

Joking aside, it would not surprise me to see FAANG names go 20-30% higher over the next two months. 

What's really going to be interesting (and is an actually relevant fundamentals discussion) is to see is if these Big Cloud tech names start to follow the trend Apple recently set and start moving their hardware in-house --- the balance of power has already started to shift away from NVDA / AMD / INTC and with more aggressive moves, FAANG would really start to solidify their positions at a critical moment in time. 

Will be interesting to watch how this plays out respective to earnings in Q3 and Q4. Cheers.MSFT 25?Reddit updates. They’re trying to improve user engagement across the platform. Are turning it basically just into vanilla overly algorithm based and community blending standard social media. Reddit is dyingLooks like you broke Reddit.  

*I award you no points*, and may God have mercy on your soul.You’re retarded if you buy a 1 DTE option...I totally agree. Assuming that none of these pumpccines pan out, I see a lot of consolidation from mega caps feasting on companies flirting with bankruptcy. Hell, AMZN is crushing their vertical integration plans -- soon they'll control the entire supply chain for their e-commerce section. Who can compete with a company that does *everything*? How long will it take for moral hazard to rear its head, knowing that no one can replace your business? I'm afraid things will end up like with the mega banks and the shady bullshit they pull. It's really disturbingGood point. If more companies start designing their own silicon, the big winners would be the fabs. TSM is a likely candidate - they already manufacture chips for Apple, so it's likely they will be tasked with making their new "Apple silicon". INTC is also in the foundry business, so they'd probably be happy to manufacture their customers' custom designs. But AMD and NVDA are fabless, so they might start to lose enterprise business if/when such a shift happens.Not just Faang. TSLA is designing their own AI chipsI can’t even begin to describe how much that fucking sucks ass!11 karma. Who have you paid to gain access to my inbox? Tell me now young newbie-wan kanobiReminds me of a chart from a 2016 Social Capital pitch deck showing a list of major AMZN cost categories that they were in the process of (and now basically successfull in) converting into revenue streams instead (i.e. AWS, Amazon Fulfilment, Amazon Payments, Air Freight, etc...).

Their 2016 thesis was AMZN market cap of $3Trillion by 2025. Chamath is king!

Here's the whole pitch deck...It's pretty impressive:
https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/palihapitiya_sohn.pdfMoral Hazard is spot on. 

People don't seem to realize that the fiat markets are no longer *free* markets when the Fed is the backstop to *everything*. 

Even politicians are compelled by moral hazard to let corporations take risky moves (e.g., stock buybacks), bail them out when they are in hot water (can't let those 50,000 jobs disappear!), and monopolize *everything ---* because, if they didn't, then they'd lose their election to their opponent who is more "business-friendly" and "creating jobs". 

It's a human centipede of race-to-the-bottom decisions that is making the economy hollow.Yeah it’s a pain in the bunzOnly a Sith deals in absolutesAt the rate it's going, it'll be there by 2022. Fucking hellExactly!! Why bother worrying about silly things like "risk" when you're guaranteed a bailout from the ~~taxpayers~~ government? All you need to do is apologize, *maybe* appear in front of a congressional committee, and boom. Back to leveraging to the tits.

America is such a god damn corporate welfare state, and I fucking hate that. It makes me sick.

But hey, illegal immigrants and muslims and poor people are what's killing this country! Not corporations and the 1%, no no*Shhhhhhh*, don't pay attention to the blatant kleptocracy / plutocracy!  

Number go **up**! *See?!*

The rats can't escape the race they hate because it's the only race they know . . .

"*He had won the victory over himself. He loved Big Brother."*The number of parallels between *1984* and the modern political machine truly depresses me 😔

I'll get off my soap box now. We've veered pretty far off topic for an options sub lolSpeaking of tech-heavy, many people lost a ton of money when MSFT, TSLA, NVDA, FSLY, NFLX, AMD, and others went flat or down last week.  That's the hazard of options in that a flat week can mean theta murders you.

I've never found a consistent winning approach that didn't involve lots of shares, and that's very hard to do with a tiny account.Everyone’s a genius in a bull marketI’m up YTD because of my bond holdings. It’s crazy it’s up almost 7% YTD.The past 4 years the market has rewarded bad traders. You could by an stock or option; hold it for 2-3 months and have a 80% win rate. A lot of people think they’re warren buffet right now and can’t lose. A lot of these people will probably blow up their accounts when market conditions changeThis year I opened a Webull account in addition to my Fidelity account I've had for years. Seeing apps like Webull and Robinhood immediately makes one thing very clear. These apps are building social media platforms on top of the stock market. People can comment on stocks, vote bullish or bearish, it creates all these new data points alongside analyst sentiment. The stock market is becoming a social media platform and I'm starting to think it's gonna be a different beast going forward.QQQ returns is even way better. It really matters less what indices are used. These are easy money. Government is throwing in money keep the economy going that would have collapsed.

People's memories are short lived. The same people may not remember they lost as much during the down cycle.  Those who start with $10K on Jan 1, 2020 remains to have same amount almost 7 month later meaning they gained nothing.

Those who got caught with a larger portfolio during a market correction do not have time to do switch instantly. Strategy play can be a big deal. It is very hard for me to believe those who made very well will instantly switch to a money market and stop trying what they excelled.Lots if shares for covered calls?What would you consider as a tiny account?I disagree with the excuse that you need big money to make any money. The smaller your position, the easier it is to get in - not the other way around. If you are small, the big guys ignore you cause they are looking to spear a whale not a minnow. The approach to making big money with small money is the compounding of returns over time. Just sneak into a position with small money and let it grow over a year or ten years and when its up 10x or more its not small anymore. Then you wait for a big record volume surge to ATH's and when it's life-changing you take the money (cry for a minute) and start your new chapter of life - Dude...But didnt we just experience that market change with the covid crash? From my point of view the only thing that can cause another crash that will fight the FED is an trade war/possibilty of war/ election.Like the dodgecoin spike?Interesting perspective...Need to monitor across Social Media platforms for exposure vs reading the WSJ.....very different from the 1980's...Less than 5 digits. If you can't buy 100 shares of a stock to write calls or puts off of, I'd call that a tiny account. Micro would be a few hundred.Five figure accounts don't move markets. Hell, seven figure accounts wouldn't move markets. IDK what you're talking about with "sneaking" into position and waiting ten years.The market did not change at all. It pulled back for one month. Then Continued it’s insane bull rally like it has been for the past 4 yearsYou can achieve the same P+L with a call vertical debit spread (and no stock).  It will cost a fraction of the amount to do that way.This can also be viewed as pairing a long with a synthetic short.What are the Greeks like on a collar position?What if it goes sideways for a while?Start a youtube, i'll subscribeBecome the skewCollars are great. Sometimes  you can can get enough from selling the call to pay for the put completely...I have also turned the put in into a vertical debit spread to and get net credit selling the call...hate capping upside thoThis doesn't work.  Premiums are priced fairly.  You'll get good premium where there's a good chance the stock will take off like a rocket ship and then miss out on huge gains.  In calmer market condition you make next to nothing and suffer from adverse selection.. e.g. INTC this past Fri.BUY +1 COVERED MU 100 18 SEP 20 52.5 CALL/MU u/47.77 LMT \[TO OPEN/TO OPEN\]This is not finance advice, but my YouTube channel is 😎 Like and subscribe.You’re probably right and I’m no expert. I usually open the collar with 30DTE and I’ve found that I’ve been able to close the reopen the short call multiple times and collect more premium during that time. It might be just because of the choppy movement during these times and I’ve been lucky. That’s why I said I didn’t find collars appealing before, but they seem to work well for me recently.I just think of it as synthetically shorting the same amount of long shares.+ delta. The others depend on the strikes. Whichever is closer to ITM will dominate.If stock doesn’t move at all I lose money. That’s why I said it doesn’t work all the time, and I’m only doing it for explosive stocks that I believe would move to the upside but want some insurance on the downside.Either nothing if your short call was worth exactly the cost of your long put, or if you collected a small credit, you keep that.It's risky to try to time the market with the short call but you can do that with the vertical spread too.There's no way a barely ITM put is cheaper than an OTM call though, right? So you definitely lose some money. Unless I'm missing something.For sure. That's my bad. OP said he bought At his cost basis or slightly below. When I think of collars I usually think of buying OTM almost like a stop-loss. In OP's example he would probably lose some money if he is putting on the collar as he buys the shares. From what I understand, collars are best for stocks that you already owned, but you are worried about a drop onYou’re correctI'd hold TMF or maybe TLT calls. Usually treasuries are negatively correlated with equities.So many people ask for hedge advice here... But I like to keep it simple

Buy a fucking putBuying options on VIX against QQQ is like saying since I'm up on weather futures, I will invest a small percentage of my gains on a ski resort in the neighboring state.

Vix is not a tail event. A tail event is the "disproportionate role in defining the properties of distribution, which mathematically, means a smaller one for the 'body'"

Vix mostly measures atm options at the center of the distribution. ATM options have linear payoffs and corresponds with the conditional first moment. Therefore, Vix measures the second moment mostly. You bet on the fourth moment by selling around the money options on Vix and purchasing options in the tails to get second moment gains and neutrality. This means short volatility in the body because higher volatility of volatility means lower action in the center of distribution

Enjoy free tendies, friends

BASICALLY

SPY distributions are retardedly awesome. You don't need math to figure out where the first moment is. Sell puts on vix accordingly.

Buying puts on vix is how to get ur tendies stolen.

Buying calls on Vix is also how you get your tendies stolen.

For nerds who can do math:

fat tails means "higher peaks" for the distribution as, the fatter the tails, the more markets spend time between µ− root(1/2 ( 5 − root 17)) σ and µ + root(1/2 + 5 − root17) σ where σ is the standard deviation and µ the mean of the distribution (we used the Gaussian here as a base for ease of presentation but the argument applies to all unimodal distributions with "bell-shape" curves, known as semiconcave). And "higher peaks" means less variations that are not tail events, more quiet times, not less.I play with TNA all the time. 3x etfs can be quite profitable. You seem to understand the risks, so good for you.

Hedges are tough. I typically avoid them and just use position sizing to keep my risk down to where I can sleep at night. 

Having said that, have you looked at TQQQ ratio put spreads maybe one month out? You might be able to find a hedge that doesn't cost much but could return big if TQQQ takes a big dip.Wow, I wasn't aware you were able to buy calls on SQQQ - must just be my broker

leverage \* leverage = sounds like you can't lose :P

What about ratio back spreads?

i.e. Sell one put, buy two at a lower strike price (hopefully with an overall positive carry)I’ve been doing call credit spreads in almost for 3 weeks now on TQQQ. Last week I got burned due to the slump towards the end of the week, what’s been your strategy for how much you go out of the money? I’ve been going around 5 dollars out of the money 1 or 2 weeks ahead. Id love to hear another persons insight on this cause it seems like it’s just going up.I'm confused. You say you're day-trading? You don't need to hedge day-tradesRatio diags or TLT equityI wish I understood what all this jargon meant. Is there a place I can learn what tqqq is? What calls are? All that jazz???TLT calls are interesting. I'm curious though why volatility doesn't seem to be mentioned much as a hedge. people like to short it in good times but the return in a disaster can be massiveHaha thank you and well said. 

I guess I have a more general question then -- whats the appropriate time to use these volatility products? is it always better to hedge with a put on your long positions or are there times when long vol would be better?At the top!! Wait, where is top :/I like to keep it even simpler. Short SPY shares. No expiration that way!I have no clue what any of that meant but I gathered you are recommending selling options on vix which is something that I do so I like it.More free tendies because this was a truly incredible day.

Ratio backspreads tomorrow

Buy a large number of otm puts and calls. Sell atm straddles against them.

Buy 40 8/17 35 calls = 5400

Buy 94 8/17 25 puts = 5400 ish

Sell 7/24 closest to money call and put at same strike.

As of 29.03 afterhours Vix.

Sell 1 29C sell 1 29P 8400 collateral

Vix rises, buy back puts. If assigned, wait for squeeze, sell shares high to close rest of calls. If not immediately assigned, close out straddle asap.

Vix falls, buy back call for free. Wait for squeeze, close out put. Squeeze always happens at least once after first drop. Close out straddle asap.

Rinse and repeat all the way down. Or all the way up. Sell off OTM calls or puts for retarded money by 3:59 lol! I recommend selling in batches to lock in gains. If you're a gambler hold any number until august at ur own discretion. I prefer to close out trades by EOD b/c of my portfolio structure.

Win all Tuesday while institutional money steals all the tendies from everyone still betting on SPY AND QQQ.

If at 18k, pattern day trade ratio backspreading Vix and be day trader by end of Tuesday.

If under 18k. Go martingale betting system on spy. All in atm put at market open. Wait until first dip. Sell all atm put at bottom. Go all in on atm call @ atm put price. Squeeze will allow you to sell off half at least if you can't handle stomach churners. If prices continue to fall after squeeze hold strong on calls. It'll rebound and you can sell the rest. If same as today, sell all calls at whatever ur risk tolerance enables. Go martingale on QQQ calls. Sell by end of day. Should be enough to run Vix play Wednesday.

If MSFT and TSLA pop, vanilla calls at first dip Wednesday. If our lord and savior MSFT falls, its all going to shit. DO NOT BUY PUTS. Sell atm calls and hedge appropriately on all shit companies in S&P. If no tendies and broke, short sell and vanilla calls to hedge on all shit companies in S&P.I would basically agree with what is being said here, but with some caveats.

You will not make a lot of money TRADING volatility products. The VIX market is in some sense already a derivative on equities/credit markets, which means that it is very complicated and hard to trade. The ONLY possible consistent day trading strategy for this market(that I have seen) would be something like scalping UVXY/TVIX on the way done using spreads, but I do not recommend this to a beginner. If you want to follow a guy who does this for a living, I will plug  UVXY trader here [https://twitter.com/michaellistman?ref\_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor](https://twitter.com/michaellistman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)

If you follow his feed for like a year, you will understand that you can definitely make money but it will take a lot of effort.

However, VIX calls do have a place in your portfolio: When you buy them very far OTM at a VIX of 12-14 for about 6 month durations and roll them as needed. In this case, you are not aiming to make money, rather you are buying insurance for your portfolio. And yes it works when done like that.YES THIS. RATIO BACKSPREADS ALL DAY. REFER TO POST in other post. Oops caps. U will like bigly :)I usually go between 0-10% out of the money on both the weekly and monthly calls. I try to just hold the monthly calls without selling, but I day trade swings in the weeklies pretty often.

Since March, TQQQ has tended to rebound pretty quickly (less than a week) from any dips. I don't have a hard and fast rule, but if we get two days in row of negative returns for TQQQ, I'll almost always load up on weekly calls and sell the next day if it spikes back up.

Last week was a little unusual for the last few months -- we didn't bounce back from the dip as quickly and stayed pretty flat for a few days. There was some reallocation to value so it seemed like we might have been at the beginning of the value trade (ie, growth / TQQQ going out of favor). I wasn't sure if this was the beginning of the rotation out of tech to value

I stayed out of weeklies for a few days but decided it didn't really make sense that the TQQQ trade would end because conditions are generally the same as they have been all summer. When I saw TQQQ was getting some momentum this morning (+2.0% or so), I bought a bunch of weekly calls and was lucky the positive momentum lasted throughout the day. Ended up being my best day of the summer.

I've found that on a typical day, TQQQ seems to just go up in the absence of any news haha...so the weekly call trade has been right more often than wrong. Its an especially good trade after two or more down days in a row.

EDIT: my general view since May or so was that TQQQ would hit a new high (ie, surpass its pre-covid high) because of the feds commitment to lower rates since the initial covid crash. So I've been pretty all out bullish on TQQQSorry I wasn’t clear. I’m day trading weekly tqqq calls but holding/rolling monthly tqqq calls. 

So I have massive leveraged exposure to tqqq at any given moment.TQQQ is a 3x levered ETF on the NASDAQ (ticker QQQ). Usually tickers with letters in front of tickers for a popular index are levered or inverse ETFs of the index (eg, SQQQ is a 3x inverse ETF on the NASDAQ).

TQQQ can be dangerous but its by far my favorite thing to trade recently.GoogleThere is a recent paper that goes over the problems of using common volatility products as a hedge. It also discuss a way to do it right. I haven't really looked into but if you are really interested take a look.

 [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=3514141](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3514141)Well there is, shorting shares usually carries a heavy margin interest depending on the brokerWhen u go brrrr, you did not spontaneously get the idea. Algo black magic somehow leads a person who goes brrr to the idea of Vix. Vix is pretty cool. Get behind the idea of algo black magic by selling Vix to degenerates gamblers, who also go brrrr, who think they understand cool.Be my mentor ?So to break this down in layman’s terms and to simplify, you believe VIX price to increase above
Your strike price?Vxx is an amazing play b/c of yesterday. It's a bet on a second moment. It isn't a bet on fourth moments. 

Rolling deep otm on Vix makes no sense. Vix is not an insurance policy. It isn't a tail event. It's its own thing. The best insurance is literally a deep otm put on the index you're trading on. Or stock.

Leveraging vix is a smooth brain move.Super helpful. I’m doing calls on a budget so all this info is super useful. Thanks!GOOD MANI'd recommend ratio back spreads or maybe even in/out spreads, as a hedge. Obviously not as easy as just buying a single option as a hedge and calling it a day, but they can be great hedges  and offer a better risk/reward ratio than standard option hedges. Keep in mind, ratio back spreads require some strict criteria, but you can hedge by having the opposite position in the tqqq itself, something like the spy that's greatly affected by the qqq or any inverse to the qqq and spy. So there's a variety of options. 

With the back spread it's multi-directional so you can make money if it moves enough in either direction, which is great in volatile environments like the market right now.Great, this is helpful. Thanks!I said it was simpler, not cheaper.I’d like to join this team.hope you caught the vix :)I believe VIX has a ton of OTM options that are well priced and can be flipped for a significant profit. But you'd have to move significant quantities to make a bag. And you'd have to protect your otms by selling straddles against them. Low volatility but significant price movement. If VIX has any serious turbulence, you'll make a killing. If not, selling straddles will generate a decent amount of income.Leveraging VIX is absolutely fine when you are doing it when the VIX is low. It is absolutely an insurance policy. Buying puts on Index is good as well, but you have quite a bit of risk there as buying puts on indexes=making a judgement about what stocks tank. Just think about people who bought NDX vs SPY vs DOW puts, the performances were all different. 

Rolling deep OTM 6-4 month out VIX calls/SPY puts/DOW puts for about 3-4% of my portfolio made me give up these 3-4% in 2016,2017, go slightly ahead in 2018, loose 4% in 2019 and then go 10x(on the 3% allocation) this year. So I had 30% of cash ready to go in March to buy shit that was undervalued, which I did, and after the market reflated I am now ahead by a lot. My backtests also constantly say this is about 1-2% CAGR for a 10 year period and they more importantly cut your max drawdown massively. I will keep doing it since it works, just have to be patient and run it constantly. I buy the VIX calls(or rather some etf depending on the future structures that I see) because its the best way to play long vol(IMO) when volatility is artificially supressed and to remove index risk. Even if it was negative CAGR, the fact that it cuts your drawdown by so much is already worth it.The under 18k strat is literally just optimal gambling.Hope u caught the vix as well :)Well that's the point of insurance, right? Downside for explosive upside.

I absolutely agree that volatility is being suppressed. But(IMO) you're also discounting the entire market structures from your outlook. When market makers sell, they are short. When investors buy, they are actually short. When investors sell, they are actually long and when mm's buy they are actually long. In contemporary market places, according to the sec 49% of sales being short sales as of 2018, dark pool short sales act as proxies for buying activity.

So when you buy calls on Vix, what you're actually doing is going short on a tool which measures variance. You're not actually insuring yourself from fat tails. 6 months OTM on puts are actually super wise! Good on you, and I'm glad you're ahead in the market.

My problem with the general conception of VIX isn't the misapplication or the lack of understanding about the tool having nothing to do with kurtosis. Unless you own underlying stocks or are short selling, vanilla options do not provide any form of insurance. The explosive nature of calls on vix is exactly why puts provide valid insurance on whatever index or stock you are actively investing in. Diversification works but its not owning less than 30 tickers. Its more like a hundred twenty minimum. Which is why I believe in only investing in less than a handful of companies with incredible fundamentals. By doing that, I can actively manage tail risks. I also get to hit every bull and bear rally because I'm properly hedged.This is a great post. Thanks for sharing I think I’ll do something like thisIntel just said that their 7nm chips will be delayed at least 6 months. It's why amd was up today.Great analysis. Thanks man and please keep these posts comingI’ve been watching SciPlay (SCPL) and they’re up after market bc of positive earnings. Any thoughts on playsAlways solid dd. ThanksGreat write up. Do you just read the news and are smart enough to make the connection?I’m not gunna lie... I have no idea what any of this means yet. But I like itWhat option app is this?newbie here, how come 21% probability ITM is not high risk play? Win on theta?Stonks only go upYes, an opportunity for AMD to seize market share and further harm INTC. It’s all about execution and intel couldn’t executeTheta is negligible at this level. Hardly any risk associated with long term plays unless the stock moves several % against you late in the playSo you're options play must be working out? Good call..lol or put I should say.https://marketchameleon.com/

You could try this.I think think or swim has everything you'd wantI use barchart.com and it shows me options vol for almost every options traded. You can also sort by IV and export as spreadsheet. If you want to look at it as a graph you can do that too.No fee for closing IV per day: http://www.optionistics.com/quotes/option-pricesTd and tasty have what ur looking forCheck out https://www.ivolatility.com/options.j?ticker=NFLX:NASDAQ&R=1&period=12&chart=2&vct=1http://stocks.tradingvolatility.net/skewChartsI use python to create the volatility graphs. Message me if u want to work on somethingThe number of pop ups on that website are incredibly annoyingthanks, good luck with ur trading!!Get an ad blocker. I have no issues.it isn't a \_great\_ chameleon.No problem. Same to you!Now a fee for IV graphs there, and worth it..The rise in IV today along with the overnight move should see you make a decent profit. With earnings coming up and AMD swinging 2 to 4 dollars in either direction I would probably close out and take my money. 

What made you want to buy the call when AMD just shot up 8% yesterday and earnings about a week away?Sell at open, congratsYeah they had no value except time. Now they are itm with time and earnings aheadWhat’s your cost? AH you’re already +4 ITM although gap ups have been seeing some selling at the bell. Still, most stocks usually have a run into earnings. AMD consolidated for months and was in the midst of breaking out till the sell off today - unless this was a fake breakout (hard to tell bc the whole mkt tanked). I’d prob assess whether the extrinsic value of the call is > intrinsic value at my target price to make the decision (i.e., if target is 66 and extrinsic is 2, I would sell at open if AMD tested and broke 64)Thanks for posting this. I have ONE little 60c 7/31 I bought for $1.93. I don't know what to do tomorrow lol.If you don't have an exit strategy already, it's time to take the money. That's what I would do with the (relatively) short-term expiration. Take the money and run. 

Alternatively you could leg into a spread. Sell a call for the same expiration at the money when the market opens. If this movement holds you may be able to cover your entry costs or maybe even guarantee yourself a small profit even if the stock thanks tomorrow. The idea is to lock in profit/minimize risk and give yourself some exposure to the upside.

Good luck man.I bought 60 calls on Jan 21 55C two weeks ago when AMD jumped below $50.

It looks like the time value will decline quickly and IV will significantly increase recently.  I'm planning to hold calls until November at the earliest? I wonder how I can optimize my strategy once the option goes to deep ITM. 

Appreciate your help.Why would a market sell be moronic? I accidentally did the same damn thing you did. Grabbed $63 calls around $60 today.Im selling right at fucking open lmao 


https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/hwoyz2/autistically_bought_amd_61c_724_earlier_today/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfSell at open but you can roll over for some cheap 9/18 $60 or $65 CA little late here but you could sell one maybe at like the $65 strike or whatever as long as the premium is more than what you paid for the $60c. Lock in profits and still have the opportunity to make a few hundred dollars should it continue to moonHold that shit. Amd is going to rise very quickly over the next week or soWow are you me? I also had 2 60$ call contracts. Bought around the same time. 

I sold one earlier this morning but missed some of the profit for selling early. My other contract is up 100% but Idk if I should hold until monday when IV will undoubtably go up more.. But stock price could tank if ppl anticipate bad newsYeah there’s always that risk. Hopefully you did the 800 and 1k order, looks like they both woulda filled 😃Put a sell order for 800 and another for 1k. If they fill congrats. I get intels sell off helps them but they could also be having similar issues. They might sell off after they report next week. Sell the news. About 200k contracts traded between 59-65 strike. There’s gonna be a lot of action tomorrow.I would hold some through next week. A breakout towards $70 seems plausible.Hold through earnings. Will see $70+ . Hopefully $78 by next Friday. Gunna have a blow out. Amazon earnings anticipation will hold the market up enough that you won't get crushed in the meantime.its largely tea leaves and dumb luck.I saw consolidation and a buying opportunity and believe I was right if the SPY hadn’t tanked. Ok- I got an alert.Not market yea?I'd sell before earnings and buy on a dip. But don't trust me!Why would time value decline quickly? The exp is so far away theta is small. If IV increases the theta decay is negligible.Spread could be extremely wide at the moment and get a low fill...?Is that math right? Obvi with a later DTW I won’t see the same but still seems high. Either way, fuck you congrats.Please elaborate. I use robinhoodOops somebody already mentioned thisDump now. I sold after open for 2xNeither filled initially and I was very concerned with a pullback and got impatient. Still thrilled with my 2x lucky gain. Used profits to scalp the bounce on INTC. Best day ever! Looking forward to losing it all Monday at 9:32Where are you getting $800 and $1000? I bought these for $3.65. Are these really gonna fly that high?

And if they don’t fill? Do this at open?I can’t tie my shoe laces but this seems like terrible advice when I am luckily holding a small lottery ticket I didn’t deserve. Maybe I’m eating retard sandwiches againWhat makes you say it will beat earnings?LolSo what did you do this morning?I would just get them off you hands to realize your gain. So that means selling at the bid price which is a market sell, so yes, market sell.

Only reason to hold is if stock keeps moving up at open, but if I were you I would realize my gains asap and not get greedy with what is already an astounding play.do it and post the loss if you get a stupid fill.Hope you didnt listen to these guys, cause NO ONE KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN.I planed doing this before INTC earning. (AMD always fell 10% after earning) LolValid pointNot sure if you meant DTE (Date till expiration)? No clue, I type numbers in options calculator and it tell me eat steak and potatoes.Calls with higher strike price will be cheaper. If you believe AMD will keep going up, you can take profit by selling the calls you have now and buy cheaper calls that are further out. So you are still long on AMD calls, but with a lower cost basis and longer time to expirationBasically close your AMD position and open another one at higher strike and further out (but cheaper than what you sell your current Call at...if you want to take profits)What you are saying is sell at $69?Refresh @ 9:30am and put your order to sell close/at the bid price to ensure you get filled. A bird in the hand is better than two in the bush. Those words have served me VERY wisely in options trading. 

I don’t know how many contracts you own but if it’s significant I’d Go ahead and sell 3/4 to lock in profits and see if the others take you to tendie town. 

Best of luck.

For the record I had AMD65c 7/31 and 90c 2021 since June and sold them on the breakout for only ~100% gains because PROFIT IS PROFIT when trading options. They’re going to be worth way fucking more but no rAgrets.They will not go that high. 800 is the cap imo. Im only Familiar with your position because i sold puts @59 and immediately missed out on $100Did ya sell? Easy 800Do what you want. Im holding $64 calls. I had 20 $57 calls from next week... sold too early. Charts showing target of $78.Sell day of earnings before. Your calls will be destroyed by IV crush day after earningsVery high demand with people working at home.. buying computers.. everyone at home building / buying gaming computers.. raw materials costs have dropped also. Then there yesterday's news. I think out of the chips amd is going to have the biggest beat. I'm holding strongSold too early around 10am for a 2x+ profit.  Could’ve been 3x but what can ya doI’ve never heard those words before. Please explain.Yes DTE

WELL DONEHell yea. It’s a great dayYea I sold way too early expecting a pullback. But still made out great. Should’ve dumped one and held the otherYou never go broke taking profits, congrats on the winLOLThey're gonna beat earnings and it's likely already priced in. I'd sell and take the profit.Usually good advice to sell options before earnings in most cases.Sell.  Not only does the stock need to go up (1 of 3 potential outcomes), it needs to go up by MORE THAN the amount of premium you're going to lose during IV crush (50/50).

So if you advance through the first round (the stock went up), you still need to win a 50/50 round to make money.

Just take the money and live to fight another day.What would help you sleep better at nightHow many contracts? 10/13 is a ways out so even if it falls flat after earnings MSFT should pick up steam again within a couple weeks and start increasing the option value again. I’d say sell enough to to make a little profit, and hold the rest. That’s what I plan on doing with my sept calls.Simple answer is to sell and avoid the certainty of IV crush after earnings. If you want to tolerate the risk and gold those long expiry calls then go for it. But just be aware we are in a bubbleOptions give us the ability to buy/sell a stock at a certain price... the ability to have some control against the volatile nature of the underlying stock: This is needed because the market is always moving either in our favor or against us. Stocks move in part because of investor outlook. If earnings are released and investors have an idea of where the stock is moving, what’s the value in holding the option ? 

Google IV crush after earnings. 

Full disclosure I think the earth is flat and my half brother is kinda hot, so everything I just said might be wrong.It all depends on your risk tolerance. 
Do you want to make sure you make money consistently? Sell

Do you want the thrill of home run or strikeout? Hold

Holding definitely gives more excitement when it goes well, but also more stress when it fails.What are your calls ? Come on man you got 3 mores months, what are you thinking ? Hold that shit, MSFT only goes up and that's it. I bought more 250 Jan 2021 this morning, up pretty good. Aint selling though,I would hold if your plan is long term. If it drops in earnings, It will probably come back up. I bought some this morning, closed at 30% profit but that was for July 22 Exp. I feel like I could have held it through expiration as the news and outlook for MSFT has been positive, but I am new to trading and want to have a good buffer before I make more risky plays.I’d sell. They’ll beat earnings and it still might drop a bit, it’s overpriced even if they destroy earnings so... safe bet is to take your profits.Trailstop and runI would sell a higher strike call, maybe 220 or 225 and let it ride. That way you're protected from theta (mostly), lower your risk, but also maintain some good profit potential because MSFT is essential in the post covid world and their cloud offerings are only getting betterHello, need way more info. What’s your strike? What the % of then relative to your entire portfolio. How are you only up 10%. Anyway, if you want to provide more info I’m happy to help.Sell the iv crush will fuck you even if your right by a littleThis thread is full of weak handed people. If you’re already up in the air and asking reddit for an opinion you should sell because your risk tolerance is beyond low.Yikes. Never call Microsoft.When do you sell though, soon after opening bell or right before closing bell?How can we tell when something's already priced in?Is this the "buy the rumor and sell the news" rule? thanksDoes IV always get crushed during earnings regardless if the underlying stock performed well or not?This. My trading plan has always been to day trade and to sell all my positions at the end of the day. The two times I held for longer than a day caused me to lose money and made me worry about how the stock will do the following day. Day trading lets me sleep like a baby at night (unless I lost money that day LOL)My Sept 18 calls are sitting at -30%. Contemplated closing them when they were -50%. You think MSFT can reach $230?Buy on rumors sell on news. Baked into the cake means it's already overbought so it will sell off. Even if it goes up some it will pull back. Looks like it has a little bit more to go before it pulls back.This isn't WSBLOL but what about those putsI'm up 74% on MSFT calls I bought on Tuesday.This is some stupid advice mate.Idk dude, I make Microsoft calls regularly and usually make a profitThat depends on your risk tolerance. No one here knows whether it will keep climbing tomorrow like it did today. I doubt many thought it would climb as steady as it did today. I sure didn't, I sold at 207 and left a ton of upside on the table. If you're significantly up by 10 or 11 o'clock, take the gains and be happy. Timing the top is difficult and stressful.The rule of thumb is that everything is always priced in. That is the efficient market theory.Look at when analyst earning estimates are from and see how MSFT stock price has changed since then.Has a lot to do with how IV usually peaks right before earnings because of the uncertainty of the results. After earnings, we have the most up-to-date information about how the company is doing, so it is easier to determine the value of the stock - or at least which direction it should head from here - which gives us a lower IV and therefore lower option prices.it's "avoid surprises" rule since you don't really know how the market will react even if you're sure the earnings will be beat. Also, IV crush after earnings is always a very real danger.It’s elevated before earnings because of expected volatility stemming from the earnings itself - you expect greater than usual movement when they announce earnings.  So it’s not so much that if is low after earnings as much as it’s not elevated anymore.I have 9/18 250s and they’re up 100%, but I bought them at only 65 cents so maybe you paid much more than that?

https://i.imgur.com/BwlhO49.jpgI do agree. OP has a decent amount of DTE still left in the tank. But I’m more conservative lol and would rather lock in profits before an event. 

Pigs get slaughtered.Nah, they'd think he's retarded tooI can feel your paper hands typing this commentThey’re at all time high right now. Most time they’re just stable and barely move.  most companies that even beat earnings usually plummet for no reason in current market. There is no telling with this one imo but I’d never hold before earnings.Unemployed and watching that clock like a job tomorrow.Last earnings Microsoft skated by barely noticing the virus and it's stock price stayed fixed. But they were one of the later earnings if I remember correctly so the enthusiasm got sucked out of the daytraders who made a fortune off Tesla the week before.Does IV crush impact only 7/24 options? 

Or does it impact 7/31 options too? May be not to the same extent as 7/24?How about the call option at Sep. 2022? Does IV crush affect to those far away options?Oh yeah, I bought the calls a few days before that crash. All my calls were profitable, at least 30%, then they all took a dive. I have learned my lesson.True story. A rich man never went broke by taking a profit.Every loss porn is paved with diamond handsJust stable and barely move? It went straight up since 2013 from $30 to $210 now. What more could ask of it?That is a very good question. I was wondering the same.Look at extrinsic value. For OTM options you'd want to get the lowest EXT you're comfortable with, expect a significant portion of that value to be lost and hope to make up for it with the directional price movement you want.Any far OTM options should be sold at open because IV and theta are going to drop every minute you keep holding them. Yes, you're going to lose money considering how little Tesla moved.I suggest selling at open if your strategy or goal wasn’t met. Guessing and hope are not strategies. That said, theta won’t shatter at open tomorrow since you have another week. It would if you bought this weekly. The issue is the strike distance from the spot which suggests crush will have a greater effect since the strikes are considered OTM by several measures.

Update—yea, it looks like it was crushed.You’re gonna lose money, don’t play earnings with options. You gon’ learn today.hard to say but expect a 50% or more loss by open. When did you buy though?Iv always high so just hold it, beware of theta though. Take profits fast or watch it decay even if tsla is moving upIt might not drop right away. It might even go up. But by say Tuesday of next week, the crush should be in. If it happens at all.You can look at past earnings and hist. Vol to get an idea of what might happen. That being said there will certainly be a drop an IV drop but it’s hard to say how much. Some more info below 


http://tastytradenetwork.squarespace.com/tt/blog/implied-volatility-crushhttps://blog.optionsamurai.com/implied-volatility-drop-after-earnings/

Don’t know how reliable this is but states 40-50% IV dropOuchAh yes the post earnings option slaughter. You will only learn by seeing the effects of the drop afterwards. It will be significantly worth less than what it was worth at close. Only worth holding if you have late August callsI have a 7/24 2100C and a 7/24 1800C. Should I sell at market open or wait til end of day?Yes, exactly. But how much of that EV/premium should I expect to lose? TSLA is volatile every day and hasn't dropped hard after prev. earnings. But this earnings is also different. What specific factors contribute to IV going down? News articles? Google search vol.?Theta is not a constant that hits every minute, if you are being literal.> expect a 50% or more loss

And you're basing this on average IV crush or average Tesla IV crush?take profits, and then vroom vroom outta there> Iv always high so just hold it

Ok, and just to make sure you're taking earnings IV drop into account here, right?Right. So how would I get an understanding on how much this will drop? Like what specific events are used to calculate IV? News reports?Thanks for this! Yeah the earnings history shows a small spike in IV 1-2 days after earnings, so I could wait until then.Want to be honest with you I think you should sell the 2100 ASAP, these options have 2 days to expiryLook at vega. For every 1% of IV decrease, the value of the option will decrease by that much.

IV is just a reflection of what people are paying for options, the expected move is derived from this. Underlyings behave differently. Checkout marketchameleon for stuff like the below to make decisions. Hope this helps and best of luck:

https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/TSLA/VolatilitySkew/SmileGraph/Learn about vegaI played tsla earning call last quarter, sold a 950call instead of buying, when it was trading around 820ish.  after earning stock went up to 860 in after market but as soon as the market open there was a 70% iv drop. even though the stock moving against me, the call lost more than 60% of its value as soon as the market open.  

price wise: sold 950 c before earning for 500. 
stock went up before earning, iv increased, call worth almost 1000.  (was very nervous)
after earning: iv crush, call worth less than a hundred, eventually expired worthless.  

hope it helpsits just an estimate. If you bought them today with sky high IV then yea expect a huge lossDid you buy or sell?  These will likely open much lower than they closed.With TSLA, there's no telling. IV is basically the X factor in pricing.

Silver lining, those premiums wouldn't be so high if people could predict where prices would go.What about the 1800?Marketchameleon charges money. Vega is .36 so is that 36 cents?I bought them. Why do you think they will open lower than they closed? Just curious. Tesla mean IV doesn't usually drop TOO far after earnings. And stock is way upSell them asap or gamble themNo, sign up for a free account and many of the features (including vol stuff) are free.

That depends on the platform you're using, some display in cents and others in dollars. Being that your're referring to TSLA, it's almost certainly $36.00 per 1% IV change.Per share, so $36The catalyst (earnings report) is over, since tesla doesnt appear to be screaming towards $2000 they will likely open lower. Be mindful that your contract only has just over a week before exp. for that to be ITM tesla is going to need to go up roughly another 40%. That isnt going to be likely now that the expected catalyst is over. I would sell at open and take what you can get unless you plan on going down with the shipOptions showed an expected move of about $200, and right now it's up $74, much less than the expected move. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/tesla-stock-options-are-priced-for-an-unusually-big-post-earnings-movebut-the-odds-are-stacked-against-bettors-2020-07-21There will be concerns on Tesla’s eligibility into S&P with revenues propped up by 428 million in regulatory credits versus a GAAP net income of 104 million.> for that to be ITM tesla is going to need to go up roughly another 40%. 

99% irrelevant.  The 1% relevance is that if it climbs that high, OP is buying a boat.No there won't this is just false info. They posted a GAAP profit they are eligible. And even if they didn't the S&P board can do what it likesAgain, I'm not saying Tesla is ineligible. I'm saying that inclusion takes into account qualitative factors and the quality of earnings could be a deterrent. Yes, S&P can do what they like but chances are its likely to be more strict than not.

TradingView is too bulkyLNo prob just Venmo me $2 ;)Bought it when it was 12.80 but only bought 1 stock.  Rookie college mistake 🤦🏻‍♂️This is me with NVAX. Got in at .70 cents before the reverse stock split. Wish I bought more shares again after that because now it’s soaring.Lol, but seriously thanks everyone on this sub. All my stocks are doing great, even after the great covid-19 plunge everything recovered to where it was or higher. I've learned a lot here. I don't have much in my account but what I have is doing well.

Big thanks to everyone that said don't panic and keep holding. I panic sold Carnival. That was my only real mistake.AMD has literally paid off my truck, 50% of my house, and gives me a huge security bump for retiring in a few years. I wish I could give something back to the company.Just sold my single share I've been holding onto since $28 when Linus said to buy the amd stock lmao, it's put timethat's a good price to get AMD, congrats man. I was thinking of buying 2 contracts when it was trading around that price but was too scared lf that second crash lol.I sold yesterday at 49 because it wasn’t moving 😂I’ve been riding AMD since $6.

But it killed me this week.

I had option calls that expired last Friday.

I was certain this weeks run would happen last week.

Just goes to show, even when you know, you don’t know.Those are rookie gains. Gpl is going so crazy I can't wait to loose all my gains.How I feel being up over 100% on Tesla with my $2.30 fractional shareHahaha, facts! I bought mine right starting of COVID when it was $46.1 but spent the rest of the money on MSFT, TSLA, and Beyond meat. Wish I spent all on AMD lol!I’m still kicking myself for only buying 1 share of SPCE last weekAMD short seller gang wyaOne share in a $54. Think I'll put a down payment on a house.I bought 40 at 9, it sank for a while and sold at 12. Kept 2 though 🤠Got mine at 12 a pop for 6 shares last year cuz I got a Ryzen 1I think you should retire! :)Started buying amd in april, sold in may used those funds to raise over a grand in a month, waited and watched amd this whole time. This morning i saw it crack 59 and went all in. Sold everything for amd, its moon time.Is that like a popsicle stick he just refuses to get rid of. The guy's rich enough he should be able to get the doctor brand of popsicle stick. With no popsicle.Wish I knew what I had back at 10 with 11 shares lol
Only bought it cause it was cheaper than Intel and Nvidia lol
That would've been a long wait though lolFell ya, got ten at 29. I was really scared of getting more.. I regret that rookie mistake8 shares @ $16.99 wish I bought more!😑Shoutout Webull for showing the #2 call on 7/21 was a 7/24 $58C for AMD!!!!I'm up over 2000% on AMD. Didn't buy nearly enough (like everyone else I'm sure). Would make a decent car down payment I guess.Noice. That's 1 more than me!It's one of the only stocks I have and I bought a bunch when it was $10.20 a share and now would get $4k if I withdraw I'm so hyped I bought it back when it was cheapGot in a few yrs ago at $2.80... almost sold at $30...I got two shares so I feel like $1.Burned myself with Bitcoin and Tesla selling too early.  I’ve made up in other ways.  One things for sure.  Go with your gut because I told myself, I’m gonna regret this Vegas trip!GGP BABYNice. Just be cautious because their P/E ratio is pretty high. I was holding AMD a while back, now I’m holding INTC because their P/E ratio is a lot better, plus they have a pretty nice dividend. The market is too volatile for me right now so I’m going for safer plays.LmaoStill holding from when I bought at $13.92Only bought 13 at $55. Still profit thoI kept trying to flip it as it went up. Might as well hold all the way 🤦🏻‍♂️Hah! I'm all in on AMD with 3 shares!How I'm feeling today having sold my shares yesterday :(note for self SOXL != always AMDMe with my 4 shares Tesla vs. the massive options traders on WSBimagine i never sold at 20 and instead bought more....i might actually be doing okay.Only bought 100 shares @ $7 :(He looks so happy :)You could’ve bought a couple of OTM calls at the open and probably tripled your money by noon.I have just joined this discord for trading and I make 2.6k in 2 weeks at my high.

You shut your whore mouths right now, you made fucking investments. They made a return, you got the hell out.

Some of you made 75%+ Even fucking better. Your on the right track. Regardless. 

Find more capital. Make stronger investments. To the moon motherfuckers.Feels good to know I'm not the only one with 1 shareBought the call for January three weeks ago... yallaaaaaI bought 300 worth at 9.80 lmao wish I’d done way moreI did exactly the same except I bought 2 shares at 48! Me and my dog are ecstatic at all the profits!I bought 10 earlier for 50.75 and sold the other day for 57. F me lol


Buy the dip sometime and just sell for short gains.How I’m feeling with Micron (MU) tech stock 💪🏾I’m ready to retire... in at $14 with 7 sharesHow I feel playing apple every MondayWow bud you made it - don’t waste fully spend now.I bought 10 shares at 20 and sold at 50😢Except it is $1 bills 😂My timing is always off. I’ve lost with amd calls and hertz puts and ba calls.Brother 1 share is netter than none. FYI, I am an active trade and in 2016 bought 5,000 shares at $2 and change. Literally doubled my investment pretty kwik. Sold all my shares because $AMD prior to zero interest rates was a serial disapponter for years. Long story short if you ever double your intial investment (let's for argument's sake you owned (2) $AMD shares) & sell half and play w the houses money with the rest. Yes, I can no longer look at $AMDs ticker anymore. Cheers and good luck to you!Sell, before it goes goes back down to 6.50No sell it and get some NVDA 🤷‍♂️Any chance and will be steady climbing or am I too late?Same. Got the info from somewhere on reddit. My thought process was, “you don’t have much money so don’t waste it following advice from some randoms on Reddit”

Would’ve been nice to buy more than oneWhy couldn’t you just average up? If your risk tolerance is low, just buy small amounts at a time at different times.i had $400 worth when it was 12. I had to sell it because I needed the money when it was at 20. Wish I was able to get back in before I did at 45, but I'm happy with profit in both cases.SameThought I was buying two calls. I was actually buying two shares.I got 5 shares 5 years ago or so at $1.81 and never really opened robinhood for years because I knew nothing about stocks. In hindsight I'm glad I didnt because I would have most likely sold it forever ago. Now I just watch it thinking the same thing...how much can this really be worth, when should I get rid of it? 

To be fair I still know very little about stocks but enjoy messing around with the app and attempting to learn more.Fuck me same here lmaoNever buy less than 100$ of a stock or even if it spikes it won’t be enough to matter.It’s okay. I had over 1000 when it was at 8 dollars and sold it when it hit 16 dollars. Sure I made a profit. But I didn’t expect the insane run up. I never jumped back in because every time it hit a ridiculous ATH I was sure it’d drop back down to something more reasonable. But it never did. I still think it’s overvalued. I’d value it at 30-32 per share.I got in at $12.50 with 4 shares. Sold 3 of them in the mid $50s. I am retarded.deceased grandparent left me $100k in amazon when it was less then $4... i  immediately sold it back bc i just wanted the money... jk that didn't happenHoly shitI got 8 when they were $20 earlier this year. So happy right now.Was in at 50 cents before the split . Sold after the split. Had 320shares 🤮Two of the stocks I had a good chunk of my portfolio in before the pandemic literally no longer exist. 

Congrats.BE GLAD you sold carnival. it could take YEARS for them to recover and you're better off selling  your losers and buying more of your winners.same, what i learned is that the stock market is not tied to the well-being of the nation, and is a silly proxy for the health of the economy. makes me sadBuy a Ryzen.How much did you buy in for and when? That sounds amazing.Nice man, can’t imagine being in that kinda situation... what a lid off your shoulders!Do you guys see AMD increasing in the future? I have been collecting unemployment money and to be honest I want to get into the stocks / investments now for years down the road so hopefully it can pay dividends in the future. I am in my mid 20s so something would be nice to be maybe be solid for yers to come rather than interest in a savings account not see too much return whereas I’d rather take a gamble.I bought 20 at the same price, still holding. Also made my 2nd successful option trade today, using my new stop being greedy strategy.Time to invest in crypto.I bought two 52.5 C and exercised one last week. :)Epic GUH move!Oh damn you messed up bad, but well better safe than sorrywhat’s an option call? sorry if it’s a dumb question. still very new and learningI bought at around 16 then road the dip. When it got back up I went to set a stop loss but accidently set a limit and sold my shares. Should of bought them back lol.Here. Made 8$ then sold because I know poop about stocks. Literally began learning about stocks last week, bought a couple AMD shares because I know they were doing well, sold early.That was more than a year ago.Had 500 @ $1.75 got out at $14ish, boy do I feel dumbNope I'm a 4 lifer. holding this thing til its time to retire. Or it nearly doubles in price whichever comes first.

Every computer I built since 1998 has had an AMD. From the K6-2 to the Phenom2 X8. And im sure my next box will still be AMD. I'm a fanboy to the core.I got 46 shares at 10 bux and sold at 17 thinking i made it. Learned my lesson. Some companies are worth holding longterm. Made the same mistake with tesla. 10 shares, was in at 150 sold at 250My thoughts exactly. Put it on my watch list out of curiosity because I also heard about it on Reddit.

Pissed I didn’t buy, but still don’t trust RedditThe stock market is the worst because it only ever shows you what you **should** have done.Some of the advice on here is from some decent humans others definitely don't have your best interest at heart but use your own brain look at the charts find those entry points check the RSI and volume you'll know if its good but but u gotta buy at the right time always🐻Morningstar rates it at $25Theyve slaughtered Intel on this gen of chips and a new ryzen comes out soon and they shouldn't be as susceptible to any corona shitWhich ones?Agreed. When are you going on a cruise??Why does it make you sad? It's not meant to be tied to the well being off the country. And it's definitely not meant to be a proxy of the health of the economy. At best, it's just one of hundreds of signals.

If you want something as a measure of the economy, look at something that's actually supposed to be a measure of the economy, like GDP, and even that has its issues.I was lucky enough to get it at 6.25 ish a share a couple if years ago. Honestly this sub is the best place to learn.Much wow
The simplest way to explain it is that you are basically betting that the stock will hit a certain price by a certain date. 

It’s far more complicated than that but in my scenario, I bet that the stock would hit $58 by last Friday and it didn’t break $56 so I lost half my money. I would have tripled my money if my bet expired this week instead.Yeah. The 1600x was good after using it. I decided to say fuck it got some stocks and now I have a 3600x the CPU’s are really good value and market reflects that.gains are gainsSame here kinda. I'm using mine as a kind of savings account. If I need it, it's there, but it's staying there as long as I don't need it. It's already past double what I bought it for, but AMD ain't slowing down any time soon.That's nice and all but you want to think with your brain and wallet, not emotions.

They are however a solid long term investment.  I agree.I did Tesla, in at 250, out at 319. Thought the cybertruck was gonna tank, so I sold

Boy howdy was that a mistakeProfit's profit. I bought 30 at $11 sold at $12 3 years ago lmao no ragretz

***

OK maybe a little 😭I did the same with Tesla. Never thought it would be where it’s at today.This was me. Had an $11.88 average. Sold on gains to pay off debt, which I don't feel bad about 

Thing is, I accumulated so many shares because I did and do believe in them. At the time they had 5 straight earnings beats. Analysts were trying to manipulate because everyone held nVidia at the time and everyday came an article about "yeah AMD is on record pace to steal market share, but here's why it might not" and it kept the price below 14 for a year at least. I just kept adding and adding and adding because it was undervalued as fuck.

Look at my empty pockets now :(I bought tesla at around 310 and sold at ~690. Still a regret.It’s not the worth it’s what hey made cpu and taking back marktet shares. Tons of people prob did what you did. I let mine hold cuz. Ryzen cpu’s are stupid good values.me too, 5 in at $150 out at $350. wth but i managed to scoop one up when it bottomed out at $500 recently :DDid nearly exact same.I agree. 30-32 is my cap mostly.They have better performance per dollar sure but people are still giving intel the dollarsBack in the day, they slaughtered Intel with the Athlon 64 X2 having a much more elegant and superior architecture than the Core 2. Then the Core i7/5/3 blew them out of the water for a decade until Ryzen came on the scene. They're a great company and one to own, but both companies tend to leapfrog each other and trade #1.MORL and CEFLI guess i mean how our government seems to use it as a proxy for the economy, or massive they are just as concerned with lining their pockets as i am.ah i see, thank you. :)i had 4 stock for $600 total then i sold.Shoulda sold at $694.20 tbhDefinitely its an on going war both good companies but I'd take amd over Intel for the next yearIt’s pure gambling haha. You can make or lose a lot in a short period of time. You can do it on Robinhood but you need to request permissionElon would approve.i’ll pass on that, for now at least haha.Same here... It's going to be a tough weekend to sleep over it.this is how investing works... don't stress about short term losses.AMD and CHGG are making me proud.Its pretty bloody. But I take solace when its the overall market and not one or 2 stocks I own. Also this seems to be a very healthy correction  from some ATHs. I bought more today. Should pay nicely over the next couple weeksIts not a loss until you sell at a loss. (I hope) it will all correctI'm safe for now, I own amdTSLA gang rise ~~up~~ downWorth itSpeak for yourself! I'm up 0.27% !This week sucked fucki transfered assets out recently so they closed my account even though I told them I still planned to use them....they were like great you can apply again with a  new email so my old account is just gone forever....okay bye time to go to a different brokerage that's wont do shit like that.I’m confused. Robinhood can be used to buy all the same tickers that any brokerage can be used for. Why is it frowned upon/foolish?Doesn’t seem that bad, I’m up 11% this week.You're not alone, friend.Can’t think of a better, more accurate description tbh.Laughs in profitable Amazon spreadsDown 800 
"Sad noises"My first ever week money. I’m shook. This is gonna change how I trade/invest going forward.Its the possible second shut down we are facing because of coronavirusShares at least have infinite amounts of time to reverse

My portfolio is all options right now and they’re aaaaaallll red.Im up 3% this week. Today was a bad day thoGuys the Dow is up 700 points from a month ago, just calm your tits and don't do anything stupid.I only lose when I listen to redditI’m down 2.88% but expected it with all of the earnings, plus I’m in for the long term.Damn this robinboob app is sick, made -$600 in just a weekAnyone else get in Draft Kings last week or week before?Tbh I felt this but I also bought a lot of those dips lmao so I'm stokedcall options with Aphria expiring in Jan 2021. needless to say it's going well.I’m up 15% this year!I’m up 29% this week in RH. Paid the dip tax in another platform. Up 29% just because of one stock. Care to guess?It’s just on sale...'cos everyone knows robinhood counter trades against their customers? probably trueRisk management is your friendNak 😭😭😭Don't think you are smart, when your stock goes up. Because you will also feel dump when it goes down. Tbh I am happy if the stock goes down, so I can buy cheep again and profit long-term, when I really believe in the companies I invested.Dropped like 50k. It hurts

[My portfolio](https://tradehoot.com/8001c9f3)I'm up $20 for my life time (started in may). I was up $28 at the start of the week. I miss those 8 dollars but I'm not going to sniffle about an over all $20, I'm still intent on enjoying my short time not being dead in the ground.Yeah, I've just decided to stick with apple and Amazon from now onThat's why I use SoFiShould invest in Aphria [APHA] 

Been making money ever since June.


Edit: Don’t know why I got downvoted, I wasn’t assuming what he trades or at what level I was simply giving a stock option that is profitable as of late.

What I took from his picture is that his investments aren’t doing too well.. I mean APHA isn’t a huge amount of money but it is some.The market hasn’t been too bad this week‘Scuse me just hopping in the boat 😔😔😫Saaaaaame.Down 1% this week. Can't complain honestlyTell that to mr. margin call.I was fine until my aapl calls got slaughteredShort term?

Bro I've been holding since 2019Secured my AMD and TSM profits after holding since $52 on AMD today. Hoping for a correction Monday.Same. 25% on amd this week ain’t shabbyGood thing I sold all my amd at 56This guy ~~fucks~~ found inner peaceBloody is when you lose 80% on a fomo buy.  LolYep, I'm buying the dip and hoping it will.If you hold like a boomer you'll be fine, if your picks are strong companies. Short term, it's a shit showSafe for a couple days maybe. Big boys coming for the AMD money this week.I'm up 1.05% so I was kinda surprised to even know that the market was down this week.  I have beaten the market since the March drop though, so it's been smooth sailing for me.Nice!Because we millenials use it to disproportionately buy yolo stocks and calls (TSLA, HTZ, SNAP, etc.) at all time highs in the middle of the worst pandemic in a century.What’s the secret?Nice!  That's really impressiveNice job!  That beats my 13.8%I was gonna guess AMD, but it's only up 26%... I can't really think of any other trending stocks up big this week.  Did you buy calls on AMD or TSM?True, but I own some so if it's on sale I lose money.  I am buying the dip thoughAmzn a little pricy imo. When did you buy?Yeah like a dollarya 7% gains can't complainTech hasn't done well.I don’t think I’d like speaking with Mr. Margin Call very muchYeah bro... 2019 was an excellent year, you bought up. Market is down due to a pandemic. Wont get better for a while. By long term I mean years... not <= 1 year. Relax. The market will bounce back and things will continue to grow. Your portfolio should be balanced enough to withstand short term losses as long as you dont sell when the market bottoms out every now and then.I did the same after holding from 10 bucks. Did it this morning but should have waited, hindsight 20/20. Correction hopefully happens next few daysI hope no correction. Amd earnings is next week.why? its at 69. lolMmmmm I mean I saw a 30% loss this week on a fomo buy, it was a painful one to learn.I think they are, my top holdings are MSFT, GOOGL, TSLA, TXN, and NVDA.Honestly I just keep buying to stay up. Probably stupid buttt stonksBut you could use literally any other brokerage to do the same thing. I get it’s marketed towards the financially illiterate but we’re essentially comparing apples to apples here.Mixing in a bit of the right crypto along with traditional stocks. Most of my crypto isn’t in RH, but I like seeing the mix there.

Gotta love the negative votes for an honest answer.Anything better than High Yield savings works for me 😁 I think it requires diversifying and investing in some anchor investments and not too many unknowns. Some unknowns are good but make sure not the whole portfolio. I’m up to 14 different companies.Just AMD. I exercised the 52.5 C options last week. Sold half today. Half next week before earnings.You don’t lose money unless you sell.You can buy fractions of a share. And back in may I bought my first shareprofit is profitDang that’s impressive. I’m up .5%, and can definitely live with that.One of the hardest lessons for people to learn in this business is that profits are profits. A 1% gain because you were timid is better than a 5% loss because you waited too long. Never dwell on what could have been when it comes to investing.My hope is that it drops Monday so I can re-enter and then runs on earnings.Thats...the pointI bought a lot of stocks really close to the bottom in March, which is my only claim to fame. A lot of growth came out of oil stocks, where I currently have about 200%+ on all of them since March. I got my money back around May and reinvested them into some other stocks that were still recovering, and since then I have been generally coasting along, with only a little put into a monthly dividend stock. I have been lucky this far,but anticipate my fall soon.The bar to use Robinhood is zero though. That's the important part you are missing. You COULD do this with other brokers. But those have minimum starting amounts, commissions, fees, etc. So there then will necessarily be more of the people that people are complaining about on Robinhood than elsewhere.Yeah but 71¢ in a month isn't that good, you could make more money taking a nickle out of the city fountain for a monthPast few mornings thought I was going to the moon but each day it trickled back down. Today was the opposite 🤷‍♂️Amen! I made options calls on  NIO and SPCE this week and made a killing. Could have made more, but I got burned with NAT on calls real bad one time and I said never again. It hasn't happened since.I’ve lost lots of money because “why sell? It’s only going to go higher”. 

I sold TSLA at ~$700 a couple of months ago, but only after recovering from a 50%+ drop so in reality it wasn’t a bad decision.What’s your preferred entry price?um I'm up 28.57% in less than a month, ima do me. good luck though!That’ll depend on what kind of velocity it sees on Monday. There’s also a decent probability that the recent buzz and momentum will carry it higher and I will be wrong.Lol cool, Bud 👌👍That’s my hope since I’m in it. If it drops, I don’t think we will see sub 64 prices unless the market itself drops further.Wednesday Afternoon 😳😳😳FYI Robinhood is going to be down for maintenance Wednesday and Friday afternoonMe hiding under my blanket wed afternoon😰😰KO earnings run-up?Eyeing biogen and snapchatTesla puts ftwWould love to suggest, do not buy FDs on earning plays. There ARE people out there trying to steal your tendies. If you're feeling bullish, buy the stock and a atm put with a reasonable DTE. If you're feeling bearish, sell short and buy 2 calls against every 100 shares you're selling on, you're retarded.Pretty new here. Got about $350-500 to invest today.

Thursday, we go to the moooooon !Yeah Whirlpool is going to shake up the market.I'm either gonna make a lot of money or lose a lot of money.I wrote about this elsewhere, so going to reiterate for feedback:

TSLA will be wild, premiums will be so out of the roof. Probably best to take a selling position here once the movement starts.

The one I am really watching will be MSFT. The UW scanner I use caught whiff of some [unusual activity](https://unusualwhales.com/alerts/1045f484-db01-4eb4-ad04-43184e811da9) at the for Sept 18 at the 235 strike range.

That will be crazy if MSFT hits it, and gives you enough time to sell any increased premium. I think it will be similar to AMZN's crazy run up Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday. 

I am fairly confident that it will hit. Am I crazy or is the delta too high?Predicting Thermo Fisher will have good earnings.

Making it hard to make a profit>	sell short and buy 2 calls against every 100 shares you're selling on

Why would you go long 2 calls into earnings? The IV crush would be brutal, and might just wipe out all gains from the short unless it’s an extreme moveUsually if the earnings are above the estimate than the stock value will go up, if sales are worse than expected the stock value will most likely drop.Every publicly traded company has an Investor Relations page that links to the SEC filing. Look for 10K (annual) and 10Q (quarterly) filings. I think this method is a bit easier than dealing with Edgar database if you are starting out.

As for timing, typically company already has the earnings date & time scheduled ahead of time, and it's usually at the same cadence each quarter.Didn’t they just claim they will lay off up to 25k people though?What are thoughts on playing it before earnings?He is a good hype man I will give him that.I hope they spike.. I have several 8/21 calls ($27,28,29 strike) purchased 6/5 that have essentially become worthless.

Right up there in a league with Elizabeth Holmes.Lol whatever you sayI think so, my washer and dryer are doing fabulous so I think whirlpool must be doing well tooIt's a joke cause the original comment was most likely talking about TeslaYou don’t have an etf with 30% whirlpool??!thanksDTE = days to exploration.

Here at RH, we only trades the finest of highest of ordered derivativesand all this time I thought it meant faggotty delightsThank youI believe this chart is just saying when their calls are.Trevor Milton doesn't have shit on Liz. Holmes scored pentagon contracts with vaporware.he knows so much about htmlwhirlpool makes excellent refrigerators.They’re selling everything they can make according to my empty showroom local appliance store that won’t have a washer for me until Weds (big maybe). So either business is gangbusters or they’re having serious production issues and can’t meet demand. Probably the latter.

I like its growth potential, but I'm not sure earnings will be kind this week.To say the least lolTeach meCongrats, that's a good feeling. Haven't had that since I sold a bunch of Atlassian I held longer term after purchasing about 2 weeks after the IPOBilly Eilish does coke?NoI'm just waiting for the goldmine of loss porn on wsb after tsla earnings.How so? What if they report a profit and are added to the S&P 500?I got my pupcornAMZN ER is next weekeBay earnings aren’t till the 28th I believe. It was pushed backeBay earnings aren't until the 28th I believe, they were pushed back.eBay earnings aren’t till the 28th I believe. It was pushed backEarnings are hit or miss and it completely depends on the hype leading into earnings. There can be wild swings up or down. If there’s a big run heading into earnings, even a better-than-expected earnings report can reveal that the stock is overvalued so there can be a price correction back down. Other times, stocks are undersold, and even an iffy earnings report with positive guidance can mean a big swing up. It’s completely tied to investor sentiment, and the price swings do not always make sense.

Earnings season is a great time to trade options, but keep in mind that doing so is pure gambling and very risky, so don’t bet anything that you aren’t willing to lose.Are you aiming for short-term or long-term?it can go either way depending on if they hit or miss their earnings and you can buy the stock on a dip or a call/put before earnings depending on which way you feel itll goare good for a stock price?     Good ones.    - also Bad ones

 Bad for a stock?       -. Bad ones- but sometimes good ones.


use earnings to your advantage?   - your best bet is to sit on the board of directors.   Best yet just wait for someone to die so you can inherit the whole company.   Some noobs will never get this basic fact, what rubes!When these companies release their quarterly earnings reports—their revenue, profits, etc. for the months April-June. They usually include future projections as well.Was priced in.. 2 months ago. This rally is based on the next 3-4 months.Their earnings are in September...Throw a dart to pick a stock. Flip a coin to buy calls or puts.It's an earnings report.You make a judgement based on the past quarter for the companies’ earnings for this quarter, if you think they’re going to do well buy calls or stock while the price is low, as solid earnings should boost the stock price. If you think the companies are going to do poorly you buy puts before the announcement and (if you think they’ll bounce back) buy stock after the price dips, “buy the dip”.You’re supposed to buy puts for all of them.These companies are reporting earnings. That’s all it is sayingUsually 100% accurate. Never seen a company not report on the date & time listed on this ‘chart’!HahaHopefully you drew it yourself, since printer ink is kind of expensive.rom dom for sure. or however that dish from movie Parasite is spelledI think you are fine. or ded.TSLA crashing will usher in the Great Depression 2.0. The lost decade. God I hope I’m wrong.You dumped coz you are bearish? What's ur position on SNAP?Yeah, I too thought so. Was surprised to see it move up on Friday though.Bars aren't closed in the south roflAlcohol sales are up something like 50% IIRCBruhhh, up 23%. I told you guysThis is a rough month to own Nflx, Tsla, Msft and Aapl...not that i do or anything :’)Miley Cyrus choked?U reckon it’s a good time to sell Tesla?If it's added to the S&P 500 you mean?Ah you’re right. Swear it was 7/23 but it’s 7/30And by doing well and doing poorly, you mean better or worse than is anticipates of them, correct?

Like, Citrix might have done great this last quarter, and probably did.  But, a lot of people already expect them to be doing well because their technology is in heavy use right now to support remote workers.  This would already have pumped their stock price at least somewhat, so they have to be doing even better than everyone expected to take any sharp action here.  ... Right?

I'm new at this stuff and expect the root comment here to be about the same so this kind of simplified clarification is helpful for me at least and I assume others.So pretty much 100%Every week there's one of youDon’t worry, you are.Yeah. I bought both a few years ago and TWTR just doesn’t wanna pop so I sold the news when the subscription hype started circling. I buy long though. Not options. 

But, stonks only go up, so I might be sitting here saying “dang” in a couple days.Yeah I'm quite confused by that, thought it would drop like a rock. Perhaps everyone is so desensitized to hacks anymore...They were definitely closed for half of Q2, and weren't at normal capacity for the other half.Bars closed in Texas.Saw that this morning and this was the first comment I thought ofWhy do you think that?probably. too volatile for me already. I bought in earlier this week at 1680, average down at 1490, and stepped out completely at 1560. Shit's wild yo. Everyone knows it is a bubble. No one can predict when it will pop. The only way it isn't a bubble is if they invent tru self-driving cars or semis in the next 5 years imo lol.that just adds to the spiciness tsla earnings are volatile enough even with out that on the table.Yes- doing well or poorly would be based on your own expectations and those of the market. 


As far as your Citrix example I think it’s safe to assume their earnings will have risen, unless there are factors that would undermine the basic supposition that “company has lots of customers, company must be making a lot of money”. 

They may very well have a ton of customers, but if they can’t scale and are hemorrhaging money on overhead to keep up with demand, spending on things like server space, salary/personnel increases, any significant outlay of cash that could potentially eat at their earnings, that is where the earnings report becomes important. 


This is also where stuff like insider trading comes in to play- the C levels of Citrix might know the earnings report isn’t going to be good, despite expectations, and start dumping their stock before the price takes a shit, based on the newly public earnings report. 


I’m very, very, very far from an expert on any of this, but I have some idea on the basic mechanics of it, your mileage may vary.I mean I guess they could delay their earnings then it wouldn’t be 100%?Tbh with everyone doing daily streaks on Snapchat, and Twitter definitely not going anywhere, investing in both will be a good idea. As an avid social media user this is my conviction.People have come to realization that their identity is not private anymoreYeah but you can get takeout margaritas from Torchy's!Mostly just Nflx atm because of their earnings report. Hopefully msft and tsla are fine but still who knowsI sold at 900 after buying around 750 I feel like a fool. I keep thinking it'll bottom out, Elon will say or do some wild shit to drop the stock on purpose :(Isn't that what boned us on CJJD?True. Twitter has growth and buyout potential.Haha good point.Msft is gonna be fine. They got more active users bc of the lockdown.Yeah just worried because they dropped 5% this week, but they’ll recover long term i just hate seeing red lolYeah I bought at the beginning of this week but I'm in for the long game so I don't really care about a week of loss.I sold all my Microsoft, fuck emYeah my thinking exactly, still makes me mad when it goes down regardless tho, i guess that will come with timeIdk about that lolLol why?Got pissed that it dropped from $215 to $205 

Felt betrayedFirst time?Same, $600 from my portfolio just randomly disappearedYea It’s not letting me become a millionaire instantlyThe economy died lolI had 556 share that sold for 57 dollars and they gave me .16 cent for all my shares from a mergerYeah super weird for me too.

You are going to eventually switch to TD or one of the others anyways. Just do it now.Yess!!! Just recentlyI've had an issue with withdrawing money from Robinhood .  They always limit me to under $3.00...WelcomeThat happens for me when WiFi is out of wack and I need to refresh the app. That being said Robinhood executions are slow asf. I placed a sell order and I took like 45 seconds to execute.Yes... Robinhood seems to have transferred my $1,579.96 to your account.  I'm gonna need that back.yes I have an issue with robinhood app, its not on my phone! :DYeah man,  I'm having a huge problem.  All y stocks are redClassichahahaThat’s because you bought AZN highOh good, thought I was the only oneOne of the times that happened to me was beneficial. It prevented me from buying at what I thought was the bottom of the dip. The money wasn't available so I couldn't buy in for 30 minutes. When it reappeared, the stock had gone down 10 cents further. I bought in lower than intended. I mean, it's continued going down another $1.50 since then, but still.Lol and this is why I left robinhood. Fidelity is the wayEvery stock I buy turns red instantly ... totally buggedHate when that happensDamn orange man at it again!I’m using 11 and can’t get robinhood to work on it.Or E\*TRADE.  After I switched, I found E\*TRADE to be a solid platform, with lots of research and up-to-date streaming of prices.  And I love that I was able to open an IRA on it.  At this point, Robinhood has lost all its advantages it once had, since now everyone has eliminated commissions for stocks and ETFs.What platform do you use? I also have a Webull and TDAmeritrade account. Should I either of those instead?I need to close my positions on Robinhood, but I’m thinking you’re right. I’m having this same problem from yesterday again right now. I updated my phone and everything last night too. I already have a TD account. I’ll just finish closing out Robinhood and move there.Fuck meCan you post every move you make here? I will just do the opposite.Just turn off the phone and let everything reset. That’s what I do when my apps act weird.You using 13.6? That new updateI use Robinhood so far and installed fidelity. Fidelity has really bad designYeah I’m going to TD... RH was great for basic bro but I want to start playing for real. It’s all set up I just don’t want to cash out of everything and wait for everything to get moved aroundI don’t really swing that way, so no thanksThat’s probably the issue. I’m at work and don’t have WiFi access so I’ll have to wait until tonight.

Iirc they control like 20% of the worlds lithium (component of lithium ion batteries) production and also have revenue streams from other random materials shit like fire prevention materials and bromine. Lithium is currently in oversupply but demand will outpace supply in the next 5 years and analysts forecast lithium prices to grow with a 20% CAGR over the next 10 years[deleted]This could be huge! Any reason why they wouldn’t be on Finviz?Wow an original tip. Thanks OP! Sounds solid as a mid to long hold to me.This seems like a bad play. 

China prices rare earth extremely competitively. It’s why there’s virtually no other producer in the world. Would you buy it for $1/KG from a China or $50/KG from USA? (Not real figures). 

Only THIS administration has been so hostile against China. If Biden wins this year I can’t imagine it still being like this.I bought quite a bit of fvac warrants at 2.20 sold yesterday at 4.45 made a good little chunk of change.Cramer was pushing this today and interviewed them.

This company entirely depends on lobbying the government and getting subsidized. Is that really a bet worth making?Because the polls were lies lmaoShe did get the popular vote tho, the electoral college just didn't agree.True, but the Electoral College is the only voting result that counts, as it should be.

The president is the executive of the federation, the union of 50 States. Those 50 States are his "citizens", and they vote in the Electoral Collage.

Each state individually votes for its President and charges their Electoral Collage electors with the duty to vote in that Collage.

Thus, the sum total count of all the States' voters, i.e. the national popular vote, is completely meaningless in the context of how the President is actually elected.Not sure I agree with "as it should be", why not take the popular vote rather than the electoral college? I can't fathom believing that the personal biases and desires of one person disappears once they represent their entire state, and how any one person could accurately represent that. It renders the vote of your everyday citizen to be worthless since an elector can just vote how they want to.RH may sell it for you or may not.  Someone posted a day or to ago on WSB. Where he held his ITM calls to expiriy expecting RH to sell for him, they didn't, he lost out on 300k.

Manage your own money. Sell them off before they expire worthlessI exercised a call Friday. But if your call is ITM, don’t let it expire. Sell that call! Take the profit.They will sell your call between 3-4 at the mid point of the bid and ask prices and you get any profit.If you don’t have the cash to cover it. Robinhood won’t assign them to you. I had same issue few years agoDepends on your broker. Most brokers would automatically exercise your itm options. However, robinhood has some exceptions.

https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/expiration-exercise-and-assignment/

Read under expiration - what happens?RH is not your mom nor accountant, manage your money. Take profit when ITM ,even if means to leave small $ on the table( options continuing to be profitable for some time after you exit the position). Cut loser options on time.If you don’t exercise your options they expire worthless period. Donor rely on anyone.If your call is up past your "break even" just sell the damn things. In your RH app go to your stock ticker that you bought into i.e. APPLE, Intel, whatever you bought. Wait for it to go up past your "BREAK EVEN" then push the SELL button in RH and bam your done. 

(Then go buy options trading for dummies read understand then try a simulator trading app until your comfortable with your ENTRY AND EXIT plan for each option you trade)Theres an options sub and a noob questions thread on it, it updates weekly.Trying to evaluate the potential loss in a long call of gsk

If I did a $45 strike expiring in January for $118 what's the maximum I could lose? Does Robinhood make sure it's all covered calls?Either you sell the call, or it expires worthless and you lose your money.I think for most RH traders, it’s better to NEVER hold options near expiry. You bought OTM and you’re now $5 ITM? Why not sell that now, before theta eats the last of the option premium, and roll profits into a new position? 

Funky shit happens between you and your broker if you hold 0dte. My broker (TD) automatically exercises options at expiry. Sure you can just sell the shares at market value on Monday to cover the margin call, but that’s not much different than holding a hand grenade through the weekend.Does this happen with the calls you sell expire too? Does one need to do something before expiry?There was a post yesterday where someone lost $288k of profit because of this. 

If you don’t close you call yourself and you don’t have enough money in your account to buy the 100 underlying shares, RH will send a DNE. Your call will expire worthless and you lose all the profit.That is a terrific question not dumb. Typically if you options are ITM then you should just sell them if you can not afford to buy the stock. The value of the option and stock price will be about the same relatively speakaing. Moving forward if u think ur stock will go up. Then you can buy $55 or $60 calls if you think it will continue to go up. Do not let Robinhood screw you out of it by doing nothing. Best of luck to you!Always sellDon't hold to expirationYeah. You could easily lose 5k. Sell the options if you can. Take the minor hit instead of the big one.I never exercise call options, only trade them. I’m pretty new to options though.Don’t depend on robinhood to function. Thats the only advice I can give.if you just bought a naked call option long and it has increased & about to expire, you have until Thursday but  you can sell them at any time after you purchased them and you will be credited the .55 x number of contracts purchased ($550 if you have 1 contract assumedly).   

you do not have to buy the stock. buying the stock at expiration is more common a strategy using Puts when you’re  interested in actually owning the stock later down the line for a better price bRH sold mine for what i bought it for, even though i still had a couple hours before closing...Yall noobs are insane ive never and i dont know anyone that has ever held an option till expirationJust sell your fuckin options before they expire. Is it really that difficult to comprehend?Even if you are in the green the option will expire worthless. You need to be proactive and decide to sell after a certain percentage gain.You wouldn't have done a C on RH without enough money in your account in the first place. So is this a hypothetical question?This guy is new and I have no idea what he’s talking about. What does that make me?This is insane. Never heard of that. If that's the case be sure to sell before the markets close.It says on RH that if you don’t have the necessary buying power to purchase the contract on expiration, then they will sell it an hour before close. That doesn’t mean you should rely on it though.Do you have a link for this? I couldn’t imagine that RH wouldn’t sell themYeah I saw that post crazy 🤦🏻‍♂️Thats crazy..If there isn't enough money in your account to exercise, they will sell it around 3:00-3:10 at day of expiration. Usually they will enter a limit order for the BID price, so beware.So does that mean that one makes profits after the price has reach the call price? And then by selling it before the call expires to cash out? However, if the price drops one might want to sell before it drops and lose money to Robinhood?What if they fail to sell my call ? 
Also , I thought I wasn't able to "open a position" on the same day of expiration day.. so I thought I cannot sell my call option on the expiration day ..? Am I getting it right?You mean RH won’t *exercise* them *for* you.This is incorrect. The option will take effect on the option holder upon expiry if its unable to be sold. RH will purchase the shares, the holders account will undergo margin call and hopefully the shares do not have a major drop over the ensuing closed market period.Exactly.. let the algorithms and bots keep the change.[deleted]$118. “Covered calls” is a *selling* strategy, has nothing to do with going long.Someone that should buy a few trading books and study a bit.RH assigned my shares for a profit.  I honestly reached out to them.  If you do not ask you do not get.  I had $SPY calls I tried to sell at 3:50pm and I could not execute.  Do not ever hold options to maturity, take a profit and do not be greedy.Wtf, never leave your money in the hands of a broker, period. Trusting RH to close your 300k profit or 20$ profit when technology simply fails sometimes is irrational.Wtf, never leave your money in the hands of a broker, period. Trusting RH to close your 300k profit or 20$ profit when technology simply fails sometimes is irrational.If you don’t have enough buying power to exercise your option, we’ll attempt to sell the contract in the market for you about 1 hour before it expires.


They will attempt.he put a limit on the option which is why it didn't get sold automatically. his ask was too high.

I'll see if I can find the thread.What if RH couldn't find a buyer and couldn't sell the call ?If you are long a call option, then selling it on expiration day would be closing the position. 

You are correct that RH does not let anyone open positions on expiration day.if it's ITM, it'll sell. someone else will want it, but it'll probably be a little lower than what the current value is to make sure it sells.I haven't had an issue with them selling a call for me. Also I'm pretty sure you're right about being able to sell the call on the expiration date. So if you think that you've gotten as much profit as you need from it sell the day before. If you not sure that you be able to cover the call it's always best to sell it at the last possible second if it's a winner.Would you guys stop perpetuating this bad info. Right from their site: "If for any reason we can't sell your contract, and you don’t have the necessary buying power or shares to exercise it, we'll submit a Do Not Exercise request, and your contract will expire worthless."Did you just pull this out of your ass? No, RH will **not** give you an interest free loan over the weekend to help your broke ass exercise. If you don’t have the buying power to exercise they submit a DNE to override the automatic exercise that would otherwise occur and your options are *not* exercised. If they see that this is likely to occur they will *try* to sell your options on the market around 3 PM the day of expiration. But if for some reason that doesn’t work out, your contracts are going to expire worthless.Okay

I guess you're gonna just put me in my place and not explain it

I'll Google it then sorry for existingWow. So you weren't able to close the call that was ITM. So after the expiration day after 4pm, you had to reach out to robinhood about your ITM expired call and they give u the profit ?Lol well that would explain it. Why would you expect RH to sell something for less than you have literally demanded?Exercise the option and immediately sell at market price, if the call is ITM that is a no brainerThanks. Its more clear nowI don't play with options cause I don't know nearly enough about them, but if I buy a call and then sell it, if the buyer exercises the option, do I get assigned?Why would someone want to buy a ITM call, if it expires that same day? (Noobie here)... is it because they get to exercise and now bought the stock for less, so they have instant gains?Hmm... excellent point. This contradicts exercising that I had occur over the last couple years on RH. Many outcomes where I was under margin call for 100K+ because of purchased shares (and definitely was nowhere near the buying power) and had to sell my newly exercised shares to satisfy the margin call.I think it depends on the broker. I had a profitable long call go ITM at expiration and they (E*Trade) closed the position and credited the cash value of the contracts, noting that I didn’t have the funds to exercise. I’m not sure what the purpose of forcing an exercise is onto an account that can’t fulfill the contract.Yes, $118; the option could expire worthless and if you hold it at expiration, you are out the money you paid for the option.

Yes, covered calls is a selling strategy -- I believe RH requires collateral for any position likely to have additional costs, so by definition, all sold calls are covered in some fashion.lol what? I answered your question, what else do you want, a handy?Options stop trading at 4 PM. They expire on Saturday so you can exercise them after hours on Fridaybecause he's an idiot?

looks like the thread was deleted as I can't find it. the consensus was why would you trust RH to sell something worth $288k automatically when it isn't guaranteed they might not mess up somehow? he'd said he lost out on like $40k of additional profit when RH sold automatically last time, so somewhere in his head he thought they'd still do it even though his ask was way too high? I dunno. it was his own fault.If you don't have the buying power they submit a 'do not exercise.' You're making a bad assumptionBut how can I exercise the option if I don't have enough money to buy 100 shares at the strike point? Would they let me do it and show my buying power as a negative ?If you 'sold to close' the option, you dont own any position, long or short.YesThose exercises may have fallen withing your margin. I'd say give them a call and ask but heyo!Most brokers will extend that margin because it's low risk and makes clients happy, but their risk management teams aren't mostly robots soooooo you get what you pay forThanks!Electros answer helped more that's allThanks for the insight, too bad about the thread.

Of course If you are trying to prevent RH from automatically selling your option, you shouldn’t be surprised when they don’t automatically sell your option.Imagine being the person holding that short callYou would get margin called so your account would show the -$5000 balance but you could turn around and sell those hundred shares at market value. 

Why are you playing with options if you don’t know how they work?SELL THE OPTION BEFORE IT EXPIRESRH would be using their own money to do this

Edit: other reply is better but using margin is literally RH’s moneyWhy don’t more people do this then? Seems like a no brainier to but 1 stock at a lower price the day it becomes available when you can see the stock is already up.Yea, I think every broker has to resolve it by settling in cash if there is insufficient funds to honor the contracts. I was trading Goog calls and went ITM at expiration. I immediately called E*Trade after my account depicted a negative 100k. It does scare you I’ll say that. The trade desk said it would reverse and show the cash equivalent after settlement on Saturday, thus I’d have a credit in my account at open on Monday which is exactly what happened.

This also brings up a good point, that if you have questions about a trade gone bad or need to get out, just call the trade desk immediately. They’re not demons trying to get you. They’ll help you with your question or liquidate the position immediately if needed.They should send him a gift basket or some chocolates.You sure Robinhood allows that? I know other brokeres do but I doubt RH allows that.lol noA lot of the time the premium paid will erase most of what you would make by buying and exercising.I think you’re right. Robinhood will show you a negative balance if the short leg on a spread gets assigned,  but I don’t think they automatically exerciseYou should add a column that indicates if the dividend has been suspended.Unless you are over 70+ ignore high yield dividends and focus on growth companiesI honestly wouldn't share that. That's misleading to a LOT of potentially newer non-stock educated investors on RH. [Dividend.com](https://Dividend.com) screener can show you the % yield for pretty much everything. This is a good way to lead people to lose money, and a lot of it. It's no different than all these short sellers touting $HTZ to RH users. This is the stuff that gives this user base a bad name. I would highly suggest deleting this.This looks...awesome?  40% return on CPTA? ????O, STAG and MAIN are probably the only ones worth investing in but they are probably going to go red for a long time due to covid. Not right now but soonishJust at a glance, it looks like CRF is just priced to go down 10% / year and pays 10% div yield... go figure

GNL pays a high return but is 100% commercial REIT which such a nightmare with COVID advancing work-from-home cultureHigh dividends is a great way to get dividends and lose more on the underlying stock LOL. I just looked at the first tickers 10 year chart and it was terrible. There is always a reason why company’s offer high dividends and it’s because the stock typically doesn’t perform well.With the exception of only a few, those are terrible stock picks. This is a good way to lose money.

Stop chasing yield! You WILL lose money investing like this.AwesomeNice! I hold a bunch in MAIN for this reason but there looks like some other good options higher on the list.Jnk is also a good one. A nice stable etf.
Sphd hasn’t gotten close to its price before COVID so idk how good it is on the growth side. I like schd for quarterly dividend.Omg thanks man!!!DHT, currently around $5.60, dividend 0.32KIO has been solid with reliable payouts.SLG is also good.I'm totally new but have been able to turn my free $3 stock from joining Robinhood into $70 since last October. 

I noticed one of my stocks has a dividend listed and am just now starting to figure out what they are. 

Is there a site that lists companies that pay dividends? Is it only certain companies that do so based on the way they are listed or is the expectation that all companies will once they reach certain milestones?

Thanks in advance,

An idiot who just looks at graphsThis is great!GECC pays about .08/ stock a month and did decent through the COVID lockdown.anyone still investing in smokeless cigs? $MOYou should add oxlc to that listGreat stuff . Thank you!Save some time and just invest in SPHD for monthly dividends. Pay out is $1.85 a share annually, so .15 cents a share each month.

Edit: didn’t mean to sound dismissive OP, this was very kind of you to shareWhat stocks would I want to invest in for dividends,id like to go for stable stocks as im almost 19 and want to start investing nowHe forgot to check all of them. EPR suspended their dividends.Dividend aristocrats😂😂Amen. I very foolishly put a lot of money into VYM a few years back. When I look at my other holdings like QQQ I feel like it really was not wise.


I actually cashed out of my VYM a few months ago and put it into growth heavy ETFs and am much happier.The actual stock is -75% in the past year though, and -42% in the last 3 months...

*And the dividend is currently suspended lolThey also stopped paying dividends...If they don't lower their dividend.  I checked out historic dividends for some of these companies they are not stable, I personally wouldn't jump on these.They haven't paid it since March, might not pay it again for the rest of the year.Then buy more. Nothing wrong with going red. Unless you buy shit companies which this subreddit appears to be extremely prone to do.Look up the dividend aristocrats and dividend kings lists. These are stocks that have been increasing their dividends every year for 25/50 years, so they’re reliable. Most of the very high dividend yielding stocks will suspend their dividends at some pointXOMVIGSPHD, see my comment aboveCoca cola/pepsiWell, it depends on what you want to do. VYM isn't bad, it's actually a decent growth stock with a decent % yield. If you are looking for a diversification of weekly/monthly dividend payouts for compounding or DRIP VYM is a good holding that gives consistent returns.What growth heavy ETFs did you choose? I’m looking to take a similar strategy as you state with my investments currently.A great example why chasing the highest dividend yield isn't necessarily a good strategyImagine a deflationary cycle that could last years where the markets slowly go lower for along time. That's probably not healthy for dividends and its probable the dividends could be cut leaving you as a bag holder.

People who say companies like O haven't been affected by covid are wrong. We wont know the full effects of this for a while longer. The last recession was in 08 but it's effects didn't really start hitting main street until 09.

Will real estate make a rebound? Yeah but are we buying at peak?Thank you kind sir. I looked them both up. Now I will dedicate some time to try to understand it. I appreciate the point in the right direction.Didn’t they suspend their dividends tho?What do they charge in terms of fees tho? Since they’re an ETF>Will real estate make a rebound? Yeah but are we buying at peak?

To me this is the mistake you are making. You are trying to time the market. When you should be asking yourself, "is this company worth it's current price?". For me $O is already at a massive discount. When the price goes down, then I'm buying at a much bigger discount. I have no intention of selling out of $O unless the company gets into a dire situation. They show no indication that they are struggling.No prob. If you’re looking at dividends for a reliable income stream, only invest in solid companies that’ll still be solid in the future. That’s the biggest lesson I’ve learned in my short time of investing. 

A company may be a dividend aristocrat now, but if they have a ton of debt and aren’t innovating, they may not keep their dividends for longNo. At least not yet.  They have a dividend yield of 8% and have increased their dividend for 37 straight years.  That said, they’re expected to lose money in q2 but only about $2 billion which is not a big issue for them.  The dividend may be at risk but not significant risk until they start losing money on a more consistent basis..3% it’s very minimalDude I'm not timing it I don't have a problem buying it lower. I just don't know when the fed will turn the tap off and if we will have a long deflationary cycle. I own stag and o but I'm not heavily invested in them. If they go lower I'm going to wait until they bottom out before buying more which probably won't happen quickly.

I'd rather buy etfs if we are in store for a longer recession which we probably are since no vaccine until next year.Duly noted. Thank you. After my "fun money" gets up to $100 I plan on dedicating half to long term investments like you have just discussed and play with the other half on the short term hops like I have done so far.

The goal is to gamble with $50 to $99 and whenever I get to $100 pull out half for long term investment. 

I know that going from $3 to $70 had a lot to do with luck since I don't even understand how it all works. I'm just trying to ensure I have some sort of long term  strategy. I will make sure to dig deep into these companies before making a decision. 

Thanks again,

An appreciative noobHuh, that’s strange. I coulda swore that they suspended it. Must’ve been confusing it with something else. Thanks for the correction>Dude I'm not timing it I don't have a problem buying it lower.

...
>I'm going to wait until they bottom out before buying more which probably won't happen quickly.

That is timing the market.That's strategy not timing. Not going to be a bag holder.>Market timing is the strategy of making buying or selling decisions of financial assets (often stocks) by attempting to predict future market price movements.

https://youtu.be/SSuCOVB5R_QIt is now, they had momentarily halted it. My ERI stock is updated to CZR and back in my portfolio... it had vanished for few hours early morning though. Hope this  helps.Try contacting the broker, generally after a name change there are 1-2 days of "untradeable" status, at least according to Webull.It's annoying that I cannot see my El Dorado stock history so I know what I had paid for it vs what ceasar stock is worth nowMine also says  “This stock is not supported on Robinhood” for the former CZR ticker. Eldorado ticker says CZR now and that one works though.

RH emailed me back already saying...

" Thank you for reaching out to Robinhood and I know how confusing it might be. I can shed some light about your shares of ERI.

ERI recently changed their name to new CZR. Your shares of ERI have been updated to reflect the name change.

While the change is processed, you may notice the stock become un-tradable shortly while we process it. If you'd like to learn more about the reasons behind this  corporate action, the best thing to do is reach out to the issuer's  investor relations hotline. Investor relations phone numbers are usually  listed on the issuing company's website.

Let me know if you have any other questions at all. I’m here to help."

Looks like we just have to wait. Twiddle your thumbs.I owned Caesar stock and it it shot up yesterday. I’m up $1,000 and trying to sell them all but it says that it’s not trade-able at the moment....it’s been saying that for 2 days nowhttps://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/optionsbuyout.aspAs of right now CZR is supported on Robinhood. Who else thinks the merger will make CZR stocks jump in price?I’m in the same boat, holding contracts for 9/18 11p. Am I screwed on this?Is it true that 99 out of 100 options traders lose money,Haven't had this problemIm fairly new to this; however I bought 10 shares of CZR thinking sports being back this month will play a role in a slight increase in value. Does RH typically stop you from immediately selling when mergers like this happen? Im just a little confused as to why my CZR stock is greyed out on the home page.Baaaasically I heard that CZR options are still being decided as the merger is still finalizing its details in terms of options and futures. 1-2days sounds about right before our calls are updated. 

I got 01/15/21 $13C $5 yesterday. 

On think or swim the call is sitting between $2500 and $2800. I believe it’s showing both eri and czr options.I sold ERI and kept the CZR and now it’s floating fine showing the increase.  It’s available but ERI is dust, can’t find it anywhere now. So it should all be good for you now.this was the email I got (formatting sucks, sorry)

>Your CZR options were recently adjusted due to a merger reorganization on their underlying equity.

>Option adjustments may change your option contracts in non-obvious ways, but the value of exercising your option shouldn’t change. Some adjustments that you can expect are:
The option symbol changing.
The underlying equity or number of underlying shares changing or being replaced with cash.
The strike price or number of contracts that you own changing.
The expiration date being accelerated.
Keep in mind that after your options have been adjusted, you may not be able to open new positions on the adjusted options. You may also experience delays in settlement or less liquidity in the market.I guess thats why my screener said it went up 200% but the charts werent showing that.I had both CZR and ERI before the merger and now I have two CZR with one being untradable.u/packodmetsandgiants, same boat here. Do you think they’ll get these options converted to tradeable again?So I can sell my 13$ calls but they’re worthless. They added 1202 worth of cash component though. Does anyone know what cash component is and how i redeem that?So I'm kind of confused. My shares I got from CZR for 12 bucks a couple of months ago isn't worth the 37 bucks it's showing up as now? That's kinda BS if that's the case.I have 75 calls at 12.5 exp 8/7.... did i win or lose?My dude, im praying tomorrow morning I get a fair break from CZR... Just let me cash some of them in.... 45 Contracts 13C CZR 8/21......... It was showing 130,000 profit in my account before delisting.I bought 7/24 12.5c day before the merger. Had 200 contracts. Am I fucked?Pre merger**So my shares from old CZR have disappeared from my list . Has this happened to anyone else ? Robinhood support isn’t helpful .I had a handful of shares that I bought in March for $3.54. The stock was showing as unsupported the last two days. Now it has completely disappeared from my account.I had 2 shares, they liquidated on 7/23. I got 12 bucks per stock when the stock was at 35... wtf???I got $452 and it was automatically placed in my buying powerOCC will cash you out I contacted RH and they said the settlement for my call and puts will be payed out 2600 from 12 🤣🤣🤣YesIdk I contacted RH on that one brotherMine (stocks) is still labeled as untradeable. Any luck for anyone else?It’s visible on RH, but still has a ticker at the bottom saying “This stock is not supported on Robinhood.”i had stock in pre-merger CZR, and RH is saying the stock is unavailable. is there a way i can get my money from the stock or is it lost to the eather?So, I am assuming my CZR puts are toast, but want to check and make sure. I now have 4 put contracts for CZR1, but I can't sell them for anything. Shows an error when I try.Interesting. I emailed RH first thing to see what was upSame now the money is goneHave your Caesars shares disappeared from your account today, like mine have?Still not showing support on my appSame boat here, fuck RH piece of trash I'm switchingsame. i wish they would adjust the strike prices. CZR is tanking, we'd be ITM in like 2 weeks....got so burned on this one.I’m really hoping this is just another instance of RH fucking upI’ll get back to you in a week and let you knowI’m part of the 99%.99% of my trades seem to lose $ before they start making $ but they do go greenNot really. You just have to make sure that you cut the losers and only let the winners get close to their expiration date. I've lost money waiting for the last week thinking that the stocks are going to make a comeback and get my money back but that possibly only happens 10% of the time. Cutting your losses limits how much you lose and that's important with options.I have not owned any stock in a company that merged. But I have followed SPACs which have merged and there was no issue with those mergers from what I have seenA friend of mine lost money in March due to robinhood crashing before the stockmarket crashed... he felt the app wasn't very well supported for high volumesInteresting.. I have 08/07/20 $37.50C $4.15 yesterday. I’m assuming the ERI price is the stock price they are using, so the merger would have been very profitable for you and a sideways move for meWho’d you hear that from? So you’re saying my CZR1 $12.50c 8/14 might not be worthless after this settles? Holding on RH btwYeah I got that same initial email. But no response to my inquiry regarding when CZR would be available to tradeSameI sure hope so lol I can’t imagine them just being gone foreverI’m not sure and would like to be corrected if I’m wrong but I think we have to exercise it. It represents 1 share so we’d buy 1 share of CZR at $13 and receive $1200 when we exercise it.Wow they have to still be figuring out what they’re doing with the optionsI have 200 12.5c for 7/24. Please tell me I’m not fucked.I don’t know. I don’t think soMine are gone, too. The $ I paid for my shares is back in my account, though, as if I had never purchased at all.Same here. Idk what to doOnly thing I can think of is that what Eldorado and Caesars agreed for a buyout per shareDamn that’s nice! I did the buy in reverse as you (bought call options for ERI) so I’m stuck waiting it outWhat do you mean it’s 2600 from 12? U mean your 12$ call is gonna net u 2600$ per contract????Everyone else can trade. Must be just you.May need an update. I'm showing BUYSame with me.This is the same problem I’m having because I want to sell my cezars but it won’t let me. And I’ve been searching and searching but can’t find an answer as to whyDid you figure this out? I logged in today to sell it but its showing unavailable for tradingyeah those puts would have printed for sure...such a poop situation.Let us know! I’m having a similar problemYou're better off contacting the OCC seeing as they're the people who handle options.!Remindme 1 dayMy czr shares were sold this am too, don't know whyYou could try logging out then back in or redownloading the app. Only thing I noticed is that robinhood wont give a chart on CZR past this weekWhat happened? It looks like I can sell my CZRA friend of mine warn me of this. If theyre not going to allow trading during a merge, they should let traders knowIt came back for me now, its just undetectable atm. Also saw the other comments on your post and it seems there determining stock value right nowWhich is why I’m trying to figure out what’s going on lmao. 5 into 2K is to thicc to holdI’m unsure about 8/14. I checked thinkorswim myself. The calls deep in the money for January are between 2.5k to 3.0K. One month of time should be a decent $400 or so. 

You can also calculate this using the options calculator website. 

My call is on robinhood as well. I believe that once their options and futures merger details settle in a few days, we should be able to close out.What we do bud?I’m not sure if that’s true but if so I’ll be very happy lmaoI hear you man. Rich guy if it works.... I don't know though. I'm speculating as much as you guys. But the logic is there.... We bet on CZR to go over 13 .... CZR is now at 38..
..pay me my money.That’s shitty so that didn’t allow people to make a profit off of them.....Any suggestions on what to do?I'm having this issue as well.Let me know when you do....I want my money hahaRobinhood told me I'll actually be getting some money for them at contract expiration which is nice.!Remindme 1 day[deleted]I can’tStill down for me and now I don’t have the option to sell my call. I’m guessing RH is working on itAnd you’re trading on RH?By $400 dollars do you mean it’s worth $4 per contract? I wonder if RH will even let you trade the CZR1 options like the other brokerages doWaitDid you hit the $13 Jan 15 calls too? I hit that as soon as I saw the merger go through lol. 

I can tell cause you said it’s worth 1202. The $2 comes from the close value of the option right before the merger finalized....bruh.oh wow good to know...what was your strike price?Update?Yeah I don’t have any proceeds. Plus the legacy El Dorado stock is gone. It’s all under Caesars now. Sounds like there will be a mix of shares and cash pay out from another post I saw.Yeah I think it’ll be back up and normal after todayYupIt would be if there’s buyers. Idk if RH will let anyone buy it like you said do we have to wait and see. 

Implied volatility could clap these easily. Once it starts trading again we could see a big sell off. I also heard there would be a bit of a short squeeze due to the merger so CZR could possibly move even higher because of the merger and IPO rumors.Nah just the weeklies, i have 18 for this Friday 🤕....bRuH

Don't be a dick. He's not the only one. That's from RH today.You’re not alone bub, sitting on 64 Caesar shares per merger trying to sell my fat (possible) profits. I’m under the assurance they won’t be worth the $12 buy to $38 merge price. But like everyone else still waiting$11Working for me, but very little volume on CZRThanks, I’ve accepted that they may be worthless, but I hope there’s some value once RH settles the changeThat’s astonishing. Make sure you’re ready to exercise them if need be.Don't *you* be a dick. Of course it's untradable! This thread exists because it's untradable! You're one of the slow people that make /s necessary, I guess.You both are fucking retarded.Think I should sell my 2 shares and call it a day? I made a quick 60 bucks but don’t want to sell off on RH if I don’t have toJust talked to the OCC support, they said that CZR was bought at 12.41 and turned in CZR1 so any call strikes above that are worthless now and foreverFor sure, I’ve got the money if its just one share each contract but for 1800 of them I’m definitely not that liquid lolMerger stocks always get fixed, it’s not my first rodeo[https://infomemo.theocc.com/infomemos?number=47334](https://infomemo.theocc.com/infomemos?number=47334)Lmao I don’t believe it’ll be 1800. The cusip change they did last night adjusted the 100 shares to 1 per option. So your 18 contracts are for 18 shares hopefully.You mean limbo isn't real? Great insight.this is harsh but makes sense. if they bought them out for 12.41 and your call option strike is above that, then you're OTM. 

but my 13c 9/18 hopes you're wrong..So how do i execute on rh? Just let it expire on Friday?bruh fucking bill from the OCC gave me that after I told him I have 75 12.5C 9/7 300 dollars down the drainLuckily for you, yes. I have a expiry up to January. Since these options have no greeks, they won’t change in value so I might as well exercise immediately. If you want to exercise now instead of Friday, email robinhood. 

But this is all just on the assumption that I’m right about this in the first place lolPerfect! Thanks man!July 14 was day for bids to close. Announcement will come later regarding winner.the amount of people who have wrong news is insane.. everyone thinks that 14th would be the announcement date...  that also explains the huge amaount of pump by the herd.

announcenent will follow in about a monthI just want to know where i can buy one of the old delivery trucksThose trucks probably needed to be replaced 15 years ago.Bought some more in the dip this morning. Big boys were just lowering the price to get in deeper cheaper. Have to keep riding it out for a while.did WKHS just get the contract? it's price is runningI am pulling for $wkhs

If they get it that could double their valuation.WHKS already has ongoing contracts with UPS and DHL on top of being in running with USPS. Looks like companies are liking the trucks. Outlook looks goodThe CFO was talking about WRKS and their leg up on the competition.

They’re saying they’ll be broke by September.

I must have read it wrongI've been seeing the vans and smaller car type vans here in new York, where the emblem would be is the USPS logo so I couldn't tell you what those new vehicles are.https://m.benzinga.com/article/16712149?utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&utm_source=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comLol either way I’m in workhorse for the long run. Has way more potential than Nikola imo.In about a month? This wasn’t announced anywhere...Maybe an auction lolAt minimum lolAgreed. The most common ones that we see were last built in 1994.Literally saw my postman using her own Jeep Wrangler today. The truck must have broken down. LolYeah I would have put more money if I had Extra money lmaoNot too sure. I haven’t heard any news about itPump up may be related to the announced closing of $70 million in financing at a valuation of $19 per share.https://m.benzinga.com/article/16712149?utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&utm_source=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.comLol. :-)Yeahhhh they can’t do that lol[deleted]same, in since 7$ if it dips below i will just buy more.

even without USPS it has a bright future to build upon and expand, the contract will only boost thid by a fee years forward enabling more RnD and building out the fabricationCompletely accurate in my book. I put basically all of my savings in WKHS at 4.45, hoping they reach consistent 40s in the matter of a few yearsGet into $PLUG too.my guesstimate..

its know that they will take up till startvof September maybe mid SeptemberIve looked... no luckUsed to work there... AT LEAST 15 years agoDepending on where you live you have that option to use your own vehicle. We have a few places in Ohio you can drive your own.I can't picture Trump as an EV fan. Anything to back this up?I was a skeptic at first tbh saw it around 9 and then it jumped to about 13 but I honestly thought it was just gonna go down again but nope I was wrongI worked there for maybe 3 months before I found an IT job. 3 weeks of safety training but don't have safe vehicles to drive.[deleted][https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/08/trump-tweet-sends-penny-stock-workhorse-surging-by-more-than-50percent-crashes-website.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/08/trump-tweet-sends-penny-stock-workhorse-surging-by-more-than-50percent-crashes-website.html)  Think he’s referring to this.Had some downplay this morning but it’s came back strong, hoping for a solid week after two straight weeks of red. Let’s get rich!That was very concise and informative. Thank you.Yeah I haven’t even been on it as much cause every time it would just be red and I’d be losing money lmao'Now all I see is red, red, red' 🚨⛽🔥At least something good came out of this weekDown $26000 on tsla.Was literally just talking to my wife lol...same.You have money for the dollar menu?BTDSEEING RED AGAIN

The Red - ChevelleThis week was BRUTAL for me.HahahahahaWhy would you hold for a loss like that... sell the rips and buy the dips. You're not down anything until you realize the gain or loss, but that's 26k left on the table in my world.Holding long term, not for short-term profits.Im holding for the long term, I don't have diamond hands, I have bedrock hands.Not me. Almost got me, but now I'm considering buying in.Sold bngo after 20% drop as robinhood sold off. Then started back up. How do I track momentum on Robin Hood real time?I sold yesterday for profit 😂I'm slightly livid. I was considering buying in when Tesla was resonating at $980-$1000, and I joined the fractional shares witless (was told there were about 150k ahead of me); I only wanted to buy a few hundreds worth. Well, the people ahead of me dropped to around 60k shortly, and it's now back up to 120k. Meanwhile, I haven't been able to get into TSLA, and it's up a shitload. Oh well, I guess that's the Robinhood wayI’m holding my 53 shares even though it’s losing $7000 todayBought more.PAPA Elon will make it rise again. Just wait until the s&p 500 news and its gonna launch. Besides Elon isn't against it. Today was just a bad day in the market.Sold at open, can’t effing believe it didn’t skyrocket. Rest of the day was shockingMama ain’t raise no gay bear. I’m holding tight motherfuckers. 5-10 yrs TSLA will be insaneme tooI bought a call today just to test the waters.I had purchased options, sold this morning. Please do not ask how much i lost.Buy more!!!I sold 22 shares for $300 6 months ago.[I'm new and I know this is probably nothing to most of you, but *help*](https://i.imgur.com/V2A8Qna.png)I thought I should have bought in before open but I am glad I didn’t. 4pm estIs that a Minecraft reference?Smart. People sell for pennies when they could hold for dollars.I don't know about real time but [this can be helpful.](https://robintrack.net/popularity_changes)Lol. I got approved for fractional shares and bought $9 worth of TSLA. I own .010395 shares and I've made $5.My BFF told me to buy in with them at $350. I thought that is ridiculous no way will it be worth much more! I have watched it climb every day since.Holding my 4 shares with a divine keagleDamn, still probably a really nice return, what'd you buy in at anyway?Of course I had to buy a bunch of shares yesterday and immediately lost 2% of my total profits...It’s up to think people were just taking there profits.For tho how muchWhy would you s3ll with a loss? Couldn't wait few days for it to go to 1.7k again?Goddamnnnnnn prayers out to you buddy but hey, take that money and invest again bWhat do you need help on mate? Do you wanna be a Tesla day trader or investor? If you believe in the company hold, and if not, be disciplined for the right time to exit.Minecraft and a WSB referenceThanksDamn, what color is the Tesla going to be?I took out a $50,000 loan and I purchased it at $1472Experts would call this “buying high”I lost a chunk of my contract but im holdinWell.... i lost around 30k. Saying it so it can be helpful warning for others to do option trading.I was expiring on 24th. So could not wait.Camo for sureThen you have to get aftermarket work done by RPM Tesla.Jfc you mad manWhere'd you get the loan from?My man, I’m gonna say a prayer for you when TSLA crashes into nothing.hmmm, I'm wondering if I should bump my portfolio up to where I can use marginHappens to me all the time, I guess because I see a little trend upward and pull the trigger, rather than getting good at predictive analysis of the market.  Thankfully my portfolio is net up roughly 10% from baseline, so it's not a huge deal (yet)Holy moly motherfucker that’s insane. Could you afford to lose that money though? I’m worried lolI’ll pray for you 😿I have $90000 invested in Tesla If I lose it all it went to a great cause I love Elon Musk and believe in him Tesla is more than a car company he has the NeuroLink SpaceX and he’s putting satellites in space for internet and I hate Xfinity because even if I’m in a contract they always end up charging me more money each month so hopefully he puts them out of business and he has his solar which he says the sun is a huge nuclear reactor so hopefully he puts my electric company in Chicago out of business also which is Comed.Robinhood it’s 5% interest and they use your investments as collateralLol, I guess you haven't really understood tesla yet then. He got in really high which wasn't a good idea but tesla ain't crashing no time soon and he won't need your prayer's when tesla will hit 2k plus lol.It’s okay it went to a great cause I support Elon MuskGay bear chill out. Papa Elon is gonna take this stock to the moonFor your predictive analysis, are you planning to learn tarot cards? Or do you think astrology is more accurate?The expensive lesson learned is - stay away from option trading.This post gave me cancer and made my Tesla commit suicide by medianPoe's law strikes againDamn that's not too bad, compounded yearly?Did you get leverage on your 50k cash/stocks?Do yourself a favor. Research the previous bubbles in the stock market. Tesla and EV’s are tracking EXACTLY like the other bubbles, to include a cocky, arrogant CEO at the helm.hey I use metal straws instead of plastic ones, may I get a small slice pls?I was thinking maybe throwing bones or chicken poop readingThank you for your service.It’s a flat rate of 5%That arrogant CEO and his team are the ones that brought Tesla where it is today. I have done my research that's why I am balls deep in TSLA.I promise you haven’t, because if you actually did you’d stay away from it like the plague.RH messed up reading the bid askguhIt was trading around $215 all day and then all of a sudden it shot up to $450 then went down to $77. Is this due to theta deca or iv crush? Or was it just a fluke thing where everyone was trying to sell at the same time?Is the position for 7/17? If not, you need to tell the expiration. If it is, it finished OTM and the spike is a RH thing unless Tesla dropped like a rock at close - and I didn’t look.options generally tend to be very volatile and wacky at open and close. I had some options that shot up 200% in value seconds into open and then normalized, doesn't mean anything.

its possible to sell at that high if someone was dumb enough to buy it right then at that price, if you had a high sell order orseomthingspreads do this all the time on robinhood. it's because of how they treat the whole spread as one option and how the bid/ask works in regards to that calculation they're doing to get the value of the spread as if it's one option. look at each option underlying if you're curious about what's *really* going on.spreads are very volatile especially for stocks with high costs so this is just bid/ask manipulation

if you didnt realize this i have no idea why you're even trading spreadsSorry about these other comments.   Robinhood shows the BID of the spread not the ASK at the close, while throughout the day it shows the average of these 2.   IMO they do this to freak people out and have you set a limit sell for the open.  This happens to every spread I trade on robinhood and I’ve never worried.  I check my etrade and TD accounts after hours to see the correct price of my spreads and just scowl at the pending antitrust suit starring down robinhood2 reasons.
 Robinhood charts can be absolutely retarded.
Besides from just sometimes being blatantly incorrect. Things can be altered by the bid ask spread 

And

When a contract expires it loses all time value. Cause the contract price to drop in the system.
Not the actual value of the contract itselfMaybe you had low volumeU r getting very close to expiration day..so you gonna see ,smaller pumps and bigger dips, take profit while ITM.. money gonna be green so plan&play accordingly.Holy shit bro. I mean, no direct offense intended here, but please don't trade options unless you REALLY understand what you are doing, and why Robinhood is kinda shit for data AF. X2 this statement for high value/risk contracts.It's Robinhood. If all the current buyers and sells were cancelled, you will see that crazy spike and drop. You won't know until tomorrow.Autism.Because that's what penny stocks do.So I should expect it to go back up Monday assuming tesla doesn't take a dip?Correct!  Another helpful person with experience :)Robinhood shows the average of the bid / ask on spreads all throughout the day but switches it to the lowball BID at the close.7/24

I think tesla dropped like .5% on close, seems kind of crazy to loose a third of my money from that.This is why I always wait until at least 10am before I buy options on robinhood.I have no idea why your responding to this guys question if you clearly don’t know the answer.  I’ve traded over 1000 spreads on robinhood since the day my account got approved for lvl 2 options 2 years ago and I’ve had robinhood since the day it came on iOS.  Spreads routinely do this at the close and bounce back the second market opens on robinhood.  If you look at TD or etrade, the spread will show the correct price.  Robinhood shows the BID instead of the ASK at the close in order to promote fear and selling.  It’s emotionally manipulative but completely legal :)I was under the impression that debit spreads are safer than naked calls.It was just a robinhood issueTesla is a penny stock?I mean, yeah, as long as both legs stay ITM. The spread will normalizeRH sucks at showing spread value and the wide bid/ask on Tesla doesn’t help that at all. I wouldn’t worry about it.that’s what options can do to younot sure why you're acting superior when you're literally just repeating my answer?

i literally said it's bid/ask manipulationThey are :) Your spread looks great!  I just pulled it up on robinhood and it looks like the bid is 0.00 and the ask is 9.00.  Really?   Robinhood uses math from those 2 numbers to display an average value to all the users holding that spread.  At open it instantly corrects.  If you checked the bid/ask minutes before, it would have looked slightly more normal.  I think robinhood does this to freak people out but regardless of the reason, it’s a bid ask display issue not IV decay or anything with the spread.  Please post an update tomorow morning to show all these other rude commenters that they were wrong pleasethey are but that has nothing to do with this postYesIt's just a robinhood issue actuallyYou didn’t explain the bid ask manipulation and instead asked him why he’s trading!  I am superior since I explained his situation in more detail than your 2 word answer, sans personal attack.I understand they are obviously going to be volatile but it just seems strange that it would be at 215 all day pretty much and then just all of a sudden drop to 77 last second. I didn't know if it was just that the last trade was weird or if it was because of iv crush.This post was made by the BRK gangBruh, you don't often see 150,000 pennies lmfao.You clearly don't understand what IV crush is man. I suggest before you create new spreads that you research the greeks,  how spreads actually work,  and price slippage. A question like this would've been easily answered if you just looked at the bid/ask of the individual legs of your spread.You clearly don’t understand the situation.  IV doesn’t tank the spread like that bruh get out of hereExactly. So he shouldn't talk about IV crush when he doesn't even understand how IV affects debit spreads lol... why you attacking me?You provided an incorrect answer.  IV is not causing this issue it’s Robinhood displaying an average of the bid/ ask throughout the day, but switching to the BID at close.I think you've severely misunderstood my original comment, so I'm just gonna let you be until you achieve some simple reading comprehension.You told him to research his Greeks.  Greeks ain’t causing this issue.A trader who doesn't understand something as simple as bid/ask widening at close and tries to associate it with IV CRUSH instead should definitely go back to the basics and understand them before he makes another spread. Your ability to understand my comment is a good indication as to how intelligent you are. :/He never associated it, you did.  He was asking the question.  If you don’t understand them I agree with you that you need to gtfo out of options.  Don’t judge his trade just answer the damn question.  I reread your comment multiple times.I never judged his trade lmao. If you see his comment he is trying to associate it with IV crush. Good luck with options!You were telling him to gtfo because his lack of experience!  Go get some fresh air!Once again you misunderstood me.  I feel like English isn't your first language and that's OK. 

I told him to do research on the fundamentals and understand them thoroughly before he enters more spreads.  

I bet you're one of those people in real life who just takes one sentence out of context and creates a whole argument from it lol.You don’t need to be telling people that!  Answer the question next time!   You edited your comment to include the bid ask part.  Nice.  Thats all you needed to say not everything that comes before it.  Bully.Yikes you're part of the problem.  :/ Hope you realize that imparting with the knowledge to research more will help him more than just giving him an answer.Lol.  Go impart knowledge on every kid who misunderstands a Greek.Sir, this is a Wendy's.When OP mixes in The Big Short quotes into his DD you know it's solid. 

Yeah dude, we all saw the movie. You aren't Ryan Gosling lolUsed to work there. Alcon is the market leader in almost everything they make. Steady cash cow with a solid pipeline and things will be even better apart from Novartis.Is it good that I invested after reading half of your first sentence and looking at their graph for 3 seconds? Am I  a wall street?Dude. Thats a lot of words and not enough numbers.  This is a damn numbers game.wut are u high on?I'm an optometrist. There is some validity to the research you've been doing but also realize it takes a lot more than just a year or so of indoor time to make myopic adults. At the same time, this health crisis is already present in America, it's been following a similar trend across the globe. Aka if you are just looking at lasik to push sales, you're kinda in the middle of the pack

Alcon is a solid company to invest in but realize this space is as competitive as it gets. Figuring out what the next big thing is more important than figuring out what currently is happening in the medical space is what nets more investing returns.

Good luck lpump itDon’t make me play with my future like this.Jesus 1999 all over again....god help the market when shoe shine boys have become research analystsWhat does DD mean. I’m pretty new to the sub.Yes. Yes you are a Wall Street. Go get em tiger.i read the title and your comment lets goooooooooBrilliant contribution my brother, shall no doom strike upon our gulliver!Yeah no shit, Rockefeller.It’s a bra size.

^^^^2020-07-21Wtf is this, wsb lite?How do you read Level II Market Data, I don’t get how it helps meVirgin galactic holdings (SPCE)!!!! It’s on the upswing rnIs this the right place to request a sort feature?CODX to the effin mooooooooooon!Why do I have an extra 15 cents in my buying power? Not that I’m complaining, but I didn’t buy or sell anything, it wasn’t a dividend or interest, and I don’t think I had any sort of reverse split. Free money is free money, but I’m worried if some money can just randomly appear, maybe it can also just randomly disappearSay I put a stop order on some calls. But - it plummets, hard. The stop order is triggered - but the sell order is already out of range. Now that the stop order is a limit order, would it sell on the way back UP?Generic WSBshows you if there is large support or a consistent buyer on the bid .. and conversely where the sellers are on the ask. .. rip thru large resistance on the offer and you can gap up .. break thru support bids and stop losses may get triggered ..I’ve never seen such a diverse portfolioIf you had to pick some of the worst investments, you nailed it.I honestly have no idea what the thesis could really be for anything but selling all of these as soon as possible. Oil is over. Buying oil now is like buying a steamboat company in 1930. You might get some niche play from gambling, but your time is past.Sell the ones that are positive and hold the one that aren't until they go up and sell immediately when they're also positive.Speedway is supposed to split from MPC early 2021 . So you then get the shares for speedway if you had MPCIf you want to sell, sell. But I think oil can only go up. Its a solid industry that isn't going away... at least until biden gets in office. LolWe're pretty much reverting to phase 1 of shelter in place in much of the country. Oil is probably fucked again short term. 

Oil isn't "over" as some other commenters have said, but it's definitely not a good hold. Personally, I hold a lot of puts across the sector for various expiry late summer through fall. I would sell everything and take the nice little profit you have. There are way better sectors to hold shares in.COPAdd in APA, thank me later.Buy DRIP today just sold out of NRGU and into DRIP Oil is going down short term.Oil is still a buy right now. It's so low because demand is low cuz of shutdowns...oil will be 50+ a barrel which is an easy 50%+ gain....do some research and you will seeSell immediately if you have not already done so. Green doesn't come very often!😀I buy and sell UCO. I would buy when it was around 26, sell at 30. That’s went on for a few weeks and then I started buying at 27 or 28, sell at 31. Right now it’s kind of high. I might buy back in at 28 or 29 and then sell at 33 but it might stop bouncing around so much. I hope it does. If you think that UCO will go down, you can buy SCO which performs opposite of UCOI mean they’re all oil, but I see what you’re saying lolMy profits say otherwise but whatever floats your boat Captain Moose. In this case, I would love if you could share what the BEST investments are? :)I have to respectfully disagree. At least with UCO, I have made a lot of money off of it and I anticipate making a lot more money. It just keeps going up. Almost tripled in the past few months. Holding super long term isn’t the way to go though. It’s easy to buy when it’s low and sell high because it’s really predictable. You can buy/sell every week or two. I expect UCO to be up to like 45-50 within the next 6 months but the time in between is the time to make the money.EV stocks are the new craze. Ev and clean energy. Selling mad high and fastI like this ideaWhy thoMy favorites at the moment (especially if you’re going to hold shares) are: EPD, ENB, OKE, DCP (though you should wait for that one to drop a bit before buying again), MRO, ET, and if you want a lottery ticket, snag some CPE LEAPS.Profits? Ur not even up a thousandI'm really tempted.I noticed that too. I had $35 C for 8/21 that I dumped on Friday. I might buy those again if there isn’t more blood to be let.Nah I already lost money trying to play earnings imma stay away from that ticker symbol lolYea loaded calls todayYeah, put in a call.Volume is kinda low today may be a gradual bounce but I still feel that PETS is a strong company and it will bounceDon't know if this will help but... I asked RH this:  


I sold an option (CSP), but I do not see the credit in my Portfolio Value. Where do I find the total premium of my options I sold. 

&#x200B;

And they responded with this:  
Thanks for reaching out, and I appreciate your patience here. I can explain how this works.  
 

When you sell an options contract, your account will be credited for the sale immediately.

The reason it may seem you didn’t receive your premium is because the market value of your "Sell to Open" position is negative.

For example, if you sell to open a put and receive $100 as a premium, the contract has a value of -$100 because you’d have to pay to close the position. For this reason, you wouldn’t see a net gain in Portfolio Value initially. If the contract were to expire worthless, the value of the contract would be $0, and you’d ultimately have a net profit of $100.

A record of your premium payout can be found in the 'Statements & History' tab of the app, as well as your [Trade Confirmations & Account Statements](https://support.robinhood.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001358326-Finding-Your-Account-Documents).

I hope that clears things up! Let me know if you have any additional questions.It’s true haha I find it difficult to use their platform but I made 20% off my
Portfolio before I decided to move to AmeritradeI opened my first ever debit spread and everything looks so confusing on the platform. I bought it for around $2.50 and it says it’s worth around $5.75 now. Which its confusing to me because I thought the max value was $5 cause it’s a $5 spread in strikes. But that’s not even the most confusing thing. The chart says I’m up over 200% today. But at the bottom it says I’m down 340% which is weird cause my Max loss should be the $2.50 I paid and it shows that my account dipped by more than I even paid for the option. I’m so confused. Is it me or Robinhood??Is it just me or do they make you open your positions when you try to sell.  I just literally threw away 600$ because robinhood is trash. I'm fuming.Thinkorswim or the regular platform?I think a little of both, I’m in the same boat.Did you try to close?Yes and it instead opened, I lost 600$ of my 2500 account balance.  I had sold 5 of 10 contacts for a loss, (other 5 were priced to high to sell, so I canceled the sale of those 5, and tried to sell them for the lower price,  which ended in me buying 5 more because it switched back to buy after canceling) I went from losing  300 on a bad trade to 600$ on the trade.Don't kill yourself. I have no clue what you did but you likely aren't going to owe anything like that. Wait til Monday when trade settles.I can't believe Robinhood still hasn't made this more intuitive after what happened.robinhood fucks up spreads at the end of the day. its a visual bug. itll fix itsself first thing monday.I think I found the issue, thank you for supportThere was a guy who killed himself over this?Everything will shake out by Monday open. I had this happen last Friday, and buying power showed -112k.  My credit spread fell between my short and long strike so I was not able to exercise the long strike, however Robinhood auto closed the short position and the buying power corrected itself.Give it till Monday you’ll be credited with shares or cash , and then it’ll be sold back you’ll only be out what you put in everything will be okayYou have to upgrade to Gold to turn off the surprise panic attack featureU did the right thing by having a spread. Fucking Robinhood needs to fix this. I have never seen this anywhere else but on their craptastic platform. 

Don't worry you can only lose what you paid in a debit spread.Hi friend, I dont think you have much to worry about. I think that the call that you sold got exercised so that negative balance is showing that but robinhood is still processing the cal option you bought so you might lose your initial collateral of $100 or so but I highly doubt it will be much more then that.Settlement period, it will correctly display once  it's a settled trade.Yes, relax and take a deep breath no way you will owe anything close to that amount.The problem is they try and distill a bunch of complicated financial instruments and statements into a big dumb line graph for babies. Half the issues posted here are some variation of "line no match?!" 

There's a reason all the other brokers vomit numbers at you.Congrats on the gainsYes. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/finance-isnt-worth-losing-your-life-over-the-heartbreaking-story-of-a-rookie-trader-who-racked-up-700000-in-debt-2020-06-14How does gold stop it from happening?This is why I consider banning people who say stupid shit like "still the best UI/app."Srsly?YesDamn which country has Robinhood available on browser??Oh RobinHood..just the worst.Up 18 cents? LolIf you are holding options it makes the charts weird. Better off calculating on your ownAhUsaThat’s 9 tootsie rolls to youYea i know it was fine but then i saw i was down almost 300 and i almost shit myselfThanks. I’m in brazil. Will turn on the VPnHave funVOO, VTI and BND are the safest.
VUG, QQQ, MTUM, ARKK, VGT are the best performed.Personally I would Dollar cost average the ones that have an uptrend on the 5yr chartI like qqq and spyg. Then tend to be not very volatile while beating the overall marketVOOTQQQ   : )I wouldn’t call it safe since it’s new but you might want to look into putting a little into GERMS. They have a lot of room to grow especially with everyone scrambling to make a C19 vaccine.IEP.
16% dividend.QQQARKK and maybe ARKQHow do Etf work? Do you just buy a share of them & let them be?Yes. With anyone that’s a new investor it’s best to buy and then hold long term.you selected "limit order" instead "stop order". It happened with me in the past too. Use stop order if you want the stock to be sold right away when it comes down to your selling price.I may be wrong, but it seems you were banking on them being sold at that price of 12.80. The only reasons someone would be sad they sold at a higher price than set (that I can think of anyways) would be 

A. You want less money 

B. You were worried your shares would drop in value, so you were trying to protect yourself with a stop-loss, which can be done using either “stop limit order” or “stop order” in Robinhood in the “Sell” tab. 

If my assumption is incorrect, disregard this. If I was correct, and you’d like more information on how to properly use stop loss orders, feel free to PM me.I think you were trying to set up a stop loss and did this instead.You put into sell at a minumum of 12.80. The highest bid was 13whatever. So it filled your order at the first highest bid over your limitThere are a few other types which you might want familiar yourself with. ( I'm glad yours traded higher than you set it)Sorry I’m kinda new to trading. Limit order means when it goes over a certain amount, is that it? Because I set the price to 12.80 and it was at 13.07, it sold right away?B is correct. I wanted to do stop order. Btw is there a difference between stop limit order and stop order ?He did want less money. 😂yes, limit sell order implies minimum price you are willing to sell stock for- In your case, you set a limit sell price of 12.80, which implied you are willing to sell the stock for minimum of 12.80$. Since the stock the price at that moment was higher than 12.80, your order turned in to market order and executed right away.

Hope this help.You'll be alright bub.  Sucks you gotta learn the hard way. Take some time and research orders and limits and so forth. Safe tradings bub 👍🏼Yes, there is. 

As far as I’m aware, a “stop order” will immediately sell your shares when your stock dips to a certain price. 

A “stop limit” is like a combo of “stop order” and “limit sell order”. You first set the stop order, but then you ALSO get to specify the price you’d like your shares to sell for, rather than selling at market value. 

If you’d like any further explanation, feel free to PM me.[Use this link if you use RH. They have examples to go along.](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/order-types/)Don’t PM this person so they can scam you in private, do it out in the open so we can get a cut.Flip a coin?I say NVAX or MRNA long betDon’t love either tbh if pressed if chose AZN

AZN: the hopes of phase 2 hit on the 13th the rest is to be seen 

MRNA: when the news broke instantly jumped to 88 it did pump to 94 after dropping back to 82Unless you're intimate with biotech, down to read sec filings, plus have traded both regularly enough to know the players involved, you have better odds with a coin flip.In my opinion, all vaccine stock are just momentum plays. 
If you don’t get gains intraday, you throw them away. 
No offense, but I never touched any of them. 

Some might post GAINZ p0rn, but I guess the silent majority loses big time.No don’tI’ve sold all of my medical/pharma stocks I had. Luckily still at a gain. The recent congressional hearings on covid vaccines made pharma look very unethical, basically refusing to sell vaccine for non-profit. Despite using tax payer money for research, so I took my hands out of that pot.I decided to hold onto mine at least until the phase III trials wrap up. If the results are promising, the stock will likely surge again; if not... well at least I bought in cheap lol.What r u waiting for? Sellllllllll!!!!!Sell if you can’t afford to gamble on it..Did really well on mrna. Bought at 81 sold most at 94. Kept about 20 shares to let them ride....Lost 7% on them today. Sold because the stock is past the priced-in pointAnother idea is to put a stop-loss sell order in for the next 90 days. Figure out the amount you'd like to minimally walk away with if things went south. For example, I put a stop-loss on my one share of MRNA to trigger a sell @ $70. I bought this share for $60. The price today came  close! It went from $93 a few days ago down to $73! I getting more wishy-washy about it the closer to the sell number it gets! Que sera!!Good luck! I learned my lesson already, to cut my gian and lostBuying some FBGRX on a day like this.So you're suggesting to sell? Honestly I bought it off the recommendation because it was so cheap at the time. The rest of my stocks are all long-term and dont get touched, I mostly forget about them. If this is the "peak" price I'd rather sell and invest that into more of my long term options. It's already dropped a bit more, so I don't want to wait too long if it wont go back up.I absolutely agree with you. I lost a decent amount on a double of vaccine stocks a while ago and never touched them again. Gotta be willing to cut your losses quickly with them, that's for sure.Do you think it will go back up again?Big Pharma has always been decently unethical, I think it's just more obvious to people now. Honestly I didnt even know this was the company developing the covid vaccine when I bought it. Someone had posted about it on a thread and said it was going to blow up, and it was so cheap that I figured even if it didnt it wouldnt matter much. 4 shares was under $100. I did decide to sell it off, made a profit, happy to be rid of it and will be reinvesting into more long term.I did earlier actually lol not as high at 94 the other day, but still a great profit considering I bought them for 20.Eh, I only bought 4 shares, and I got them for 20 something each, so the affordability wasnt really it. I'm more interested in long term stocks. I don't like having to watch the market prices constantly to buy or sell at good prices. This was the only non-long term stock I have, so I didnt want to hold on to it too long and miss the mark. Didnt quite catch the peak, but still made a good profit and reinvested into some more long term :)Thank you! I did actually sell them off earlier, but I wasnt aware there was a stop-loss option so I looked into it. Definitely handy!I sold and bought into ABUS quick. That's who they lost the patent challenge to. I'm probably going to buy back into MRNA though while it's low. Just want to see how it plays out a bit first. Already pretty happy with ABUS though, and tomorrow will be even better once the news gets out.So you expect it to go up more tomorrow? I’m asking cause I made the mistake of holding MRNA and want to use that money elsewherePersonally, I do think it will go up tomorrow. The news just hit towards the end of the trading day. It's dumb cheap too. Alot of other resources/platforms/forums expect the same. I wouldn't call myself experienced by any stretch, but I try hard to do my homework and make informed decisions. One piece of advice someone gave me was not to get too greedy, and take a healthy profit. Personally, I don't think MRNA is done yet by any means. Im just waiting to buy back in and saw an opportunity in ABUS. Stop loss orders are useful too.
I could be dead-ass wrong on this, and my opinion might change quick, but so far Ive made a healthy profit on both. Definitely do your homework and make the decision you think is best. I'm know others will have great opinions and insight as well.this would be great. been 100% WFH for almost three years, but my employer won't fill out a T2200 because they don't "require" me to WFH.where is my tax break for having to work for the whole damn pandemic, from work.Anyone have experience with this tax deduction and have a more detailed breakdown of what is included?

In BC I assume: bc hydro, fortis, telus internet cost (is my tv package not included?), and home office consumables. 

For utilities, what percentage of the total cost should we expect in a return?

Rent surprised me. Any insight on how rent or mortgage comes into play would be great.

Thank you!I’d love a tax break for going to work during the pandemic!My employer requires work from home, but flatly refuses to sign T2200 (https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2200.html). HR explained that Canadian regulations has a major loophole and company is using it.

Basically, employers can press certain working conditions onto employees, but not required to sign off the tax form related to those conditions (no provisions to compel employers to do so).Lucrative? How are people getting big tax breaks here? I claimed a work from home space for years (portion of rent, heating/water, internet etc.) and it would be laughable what I got back. Usually like $100 tops.I honestly hope that this doesn’t get changed 

Selfishly of course I’d love a tax break, but to be honest the government has a lot better use of resources than providing tax breaks to white collar workers who ‘did their part’ by staying home....do something for front line workers insteadThis is extremely dumb. It’s not a tax break. It’s that you don’t pay taxes on your income-earning expenses - and it’s not new. For an investing sub, there’s a terrifyingly low level of comprehension of basic tax matters!Lol "lucraritive tax break" ummm or not work and recieve free 2k... people working and keeping the economy alive get nothing.Anyone know what I need to do to get this? I've been WFH all year.a lot of people dont know the ins/out of the expense claims.  Basically you claim a proportionate amount of your home expenses (rent/utilities/maintenance) based on your office size/home size.  This forms a deduction of your income on your taxes, so to get the cash back amount multiply the calculated home costs by your tax rate.

Wouldn't those of us still going to work be the ones deserving of a tax break?God, I hope so. We are contract workers working from home for a university.It's so sad that essential workers are excluded from any type of tax break.Just plain dumb. Don't waste money on stupid things like this. I understand covid comes with costs, but this is just nothing more than vote buying to me[deleted]Someone needs to pay for Mr. Trudeau next exotic vacationsso dumb, it has literally no effect to the employer.

once the pandemic started i told all my staff that ill sign the 2200 for WFH if they want. i wont be preparing them, they can prepare themself and ill sign off hahaWhat do you mean, they don't  "require" you to work from home? Is that not the case?Any idea how much you’d get back if they did ?Exactly ! I know boredom is a thing , but seeing all these posts about people making sourdough bread and counting their ceiling tiles is making me kind of salty. Everyone is talking about all their new hobbies and how well they are doing mentally and I am so jealous.[deleted]Man fuck this gov fuck this world fuck it all i don't wanna be apart if this planet its full of fucking retards the dumb ppl are outfucking the smart ppl and its killing us all. I wanna go live in Mars fuck earth and its bullshitRent but not mortgage.... maybe interest on mortgage?It's miniscule. Like not even worth the time. Pretty sure mine came to $83Following.For items like rent/interest expense or hydro the size of the *dedicated* workspace as a proportion of your home would be used to calculate the workplace allocation of those expenses.i posted this above

a lot of people dont know the ins/out of the expense claims.  Basically you claim a proportionate amount of your home expenses (rent/utilities/maintenance) based on your office size/home size.  This forms a deduction of your income on your taxes, so to get the cash back amount multiply the calculated home costs by your tax rate.

[CRA guidance - salaried employees](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-229-other-employment-expenses/salaried-employees/work-space-home-expenses.html)

[CRA guidance - commissioned employees](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-229-other-employment-expenses/commission-employees/work-space-home-expenses.html) - basically the difference is commissioned can also deduct prop tax and insuranceYou can deduct utilities as a percentage of the total, based on the size of home office / size of dwelling overall. No internet, this is considered a fixed cost. Yes to other utilities, property tax. Someone below says no to mortgage interest, I thought that was ok - check for yourself. Yes to cleaning. 

I was able to take this about a decade ago, at the time I found a list.That's a dick move by said company. Maybe if you can quantity it you can get all of your coworkers to push for the company to make you whole (pay you for the tax benefit you are entitled to but not getting because the company is taking it instead).Do they require it in your employment contract?It's not even worth your time, man.i just posted a simple calc above

>I would guess most people should be able to claim more than that. eg a super simple calc is rent at 1,500/month x 12 months x 10% home office space x 30% tax rate = $540

and you arent even meant to claim internet ;)It’s not a handout for WFH. It’s under the theory that money spent in order to earn money should not be taxed. I.e. your employer gets a “tax break” by paying your salary. That’s not a handout, that an expense that they have incurred and shouldn’t be paying tax on. (Yes, yes, payroll taxes, it’s just an illustrative example).The WFH tax credit is for home-expenses, based on the percentage of your house that you are using for work. This is exactly what it's for.Totally agree. 

I am working from home full time.  I don't need a tax break. I am already saving so much money on gas + going out for lunch/coffee.What's the definition of a tax break really? Most people have a desk or something at home, they're paying for home internet, condo fees, utilities, etc. Working from home gives you the opportunity like you said to write off these expenses that have now become income earning expenses. I haven't added any net new expenses this year, I'll just get to write off some existing ones. I think the title is fine.Your contract must specify that you are required to work from home.

Then you need to request your employer fill out a form T2200. The form will state "10. Did this employee's contract of employment require them to use a portion of their home for work?" and your employer needs to check yes.

Keep a copy of this form on file, and fill out the employment expenses portion of your tax return for use of home.Your account is not old enough

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/CanadianInvestor) if you have any questions or concerns.*So you already get this tax break.Same, working from home rocks. Nothing is preventing you from telling your employer's your being overworked. Take breaks, go outside, go take a walk to the cafe. Working from home gives me freedoms I couldn't attain any other way. I don't need work to socialize and if you do, well take a cold hard look.Why? Nothing’s changed for us. If there was no pandemic we’d commute daily regardless.

Whereas those who work from home likely had to buy new equipment chairs computers internet service to be able to work from homeHow is it vote buying? This isnt a new tax creditThere was plenty to complain about re waste, but this is an existing deduction.How, exactly, are you being shafted by long-existing tax laws?i quit, moved, and reacquired the job. they're not wrong, they're just assholes*

* about this, mostly they're good.It needs to be a condition of employment, aka in your contract.not really; i did a dry-run of the process before they rejected my request and if memory serves you basically calculate your "work space" (ideally an office) as a ratio of the total square footage of your home, then use that ratio to calculate it's proportion of your mortage/utilities/etc. i think mine came out to around $5K/yr for me, but i have no idea if that's a direct reduction of your taxable income or not.I'm working full time from home and I'm not doing super well mentally. I'm losing my absolute mind quarantining and working from home. Im working more and having less time for hobbies because there's always work to do and having access to my systems at home makes it easier to just say "screw it, I'll just get it done". The grass is always greener[deleted]There'a a difference between people on temporary layoffs and WFH.

I'm WFH and am working harder and more hours than I have at any other time in my life. I would return to the office quite happily.

On the plus side, my wife is working from home too, and having lunch together daily has been nice.If it makes you feel better, nobody who is counting their ceiling tiles is doing well mentallyHow you're doing mentally is up to you. I don't discount the fact that you're under stress, that there are things out of your control right now, that shit sucks, but being salty about other people who live an entirely different life from yours is a losing game and is probably just going to make you perform worse, make poorer decisions, and be unhappy. Think about what you do have, what is going well, what optimism lies in the future (even the tiniest amount/type), and focus on the things you actually have control over.Haven't been able to get yeast for the longest time, I wanna make bread!People working from home could very well have "full employment" too, saving perhaps 2 hours each day in travel, not to mention travel expenses.   While the government got rid of the public transit tax credit years ago at the expense of daily commuters.no interestMortgage interest is allowable on rental properties, but not on home office.You need to understand you're in the minority. I've seen you post this twice.
Did you include all your internet, property tax, home insurance, water, heat, electric, maintenance  supplies, etc?I would guess most people should be able to claim more than that. eg a super simple calc is rent at 1,500/month x 12 months x 10% home office space x 30% tax rate = $540Perfect question.Nope, it is all goody in the contract. As I said, they are smart about it. Basically they ask you to work from home temporarily and just make sure it stays that way.

In my understanding, this kind of tax breaks designed not to be available. Government offering tax break, while knowing very few can actually use it. Grossly unfair, but what else to expect from Trust Fund kids running the show these days. They got their money, they do not care about working people.If you rent your at a serious advantage over someone with a mortgage.What are you referring to about not claiming internet?Yea, why do only rich assholes get to have tax breaks? I've been self-employed for over 10 years of my career. The very modest tax break helps.I've worked from home for years.

I need a tax break.

I need every economic advantage I can get because I wasn't born with a  silver spoon.A tax break implies a deduction for something specific or out of the ordinary. The concept of not paying taxes on expenses to earn income is a fundamental concept. 

A desk isn’t eligible to be claimed as an expense. For many people, home internet and utilities have gone way, way up from WFH (of course). Why should they be paying tax on these expenses anymore than a bakery should pay taxes on their hydro bill? 

“I already have a car, I don’t see why I should get reimbursed for mileage”Are you sure you need it to have it in an employment contract and 2200? Not my experience.The new equipment would not be covered sadly, only supplies and services.Oh, i dont know... maybe the fact that we exposed ourselves and our families to the virus by having to go into work?too bad they got rid of the public transit tax credit. sucks for commutersI love it when people who have no idea about something have strong opinions about it.Clearly I didn't read lol[deleted]lolDude don't sweat it. Not even CLOSE to 5k. I went through all the hassle last year and think I got like $83

Edit: lol you don't get to include mortgage payments!!!Ya, don't worry about it. Every few years I get amped app to get my deduction but as an employee with a home office you can't claim very much. It's always less than $100 I would see in my pocket. Now if you are a contractor, that's different...its a straight deduction so multiply that by your top-ish tax rate.  eg at 30% thats $1,500 back.  but note you dont include your mortgage, so your numbers may be offI'm also fairly certain you need to meet some criteria like having clients come to visit you? You can't just be a solo person working at home to make anything back.

EDIT: ignore this, I can’t read. One of the two conditions is meeting clients. Only one condition is required. Carry on.Yeah, it becomes really hard to separate life and work when it's all done in the same place.I’m leaving mine. Work got horrible and I don’t sleep. But depends on the work I think.I miss people, the communication has gone down hill too for my wfh job.Seems like a you problem and not knowing how to set boundaries at home. I don’t answer emails after 5:30/6 period. Go for walks and/or work out.Same thing... but the money is too good to pass up. So I try to keep sane by telling myself it's temporary, and I will have my downpayment for my first place sooner than I expected..Keep yourself healthy, that is and always should be priority #1.This. I am working from home and nothing has really changed other than working from home. 

I am still doing the same amount of work as before.

I'm not baking sourdough bread and taking up new hobbies.

But I'm very grateful to still be working.Yes, but nobody makes you work more hours. The fact that you work from home doesn't mean you need to work over your regular hours you worked before the pandemic.Perhaps not all of those things, are you sure that's all allowed? I'll pull up my return when I get a chance but remember being very disappointed in the result, and I do not exactly have low home expenses...I don't rent, I pay $800 a week to my mortgage. Fuck me right?! 

I guess if you're renting it could be worth it.advantage for a minor tax deduction maybe.  you can claim mortgage interest if you are commissioned as well as property taxeswell im not saying dont claim it (if i used it for work i would be claiming it).  but per CRA guidance "You cannot deduct the monthly access fees for home Internet service."

Fuck the CRA if their rules dont make sense.  Let them find problem.

This article is about updating some rules re: COVID - hopefully this is something that comes up since pretty much EVERYONE who WFH used internet for employment. (though their stance may be that you would incur this cost regardless of WFH or not)I was able to take this for a while. It's not unreasonable, it's not huge but it's better than nothing.People downvoting you why? 

The ironic thing is... many rich people, born with or without a silver spoon do exactly this. They grab every advantage, tax break, etc out there they can. It’s seen as “being savvy” and somehow people are disapproving of your actions when you probably need it more and are just trying to get by / get a head a little. 

If the government offers it and you meet the requirement, take it, my man.absolutely agree with youI mean, even if my utilities went up as much as my gasoline costs went down now that I’m not driving to work (they haven’t), one is tax deductible and the other wasn’t. It’s a win for most people.

Most people would consider the gas they have to put in their car to get to work an “expense to earn income”.If you have a T2200 you can file for it despite not meeting the criteria, heck, you can file for it without a T2200. You're just filing your tax return improperly which is...fairly common with this credit.Still deductible for me provincially. QC.

Regardless I don’t take public transit and probably wouldn’t recommend it right now regardless lolYeah I definitely miss that creditYou get plenty of recognition. We are all very thankful. I would love if it you were given some emergency pay or just a flat out raise for doing whatever it is you do, I don't think a tax break is the right approach.Most money spend trying to earn income in our society is tax deductible - always has been - that’s the basis of this write off. If a part of your expenses go towards earning your income, setting up a home office, having a dedicated work space you pay rent for, etc, then you get to write that off as a work expense - because that’s what it is. 

That’s all that’s happening here. On the other hand it sounds me like you’re just looking for a hand out for no reason.thank you for confirming it's not worth the paperwork :DFor self employed you do use your mortgage interest at least.I got $120 last year and was pretty aggressive on claiming things.  It's a pittance.Not truem just has to be a condition of your employment that you work from home more than 50% of the timeNormally I wouldn’t reply to emails until I arrived at the office, but now I feel compelled to start almost as soon as I wake because there is no separation.What work are you doingMine as well. If you work in a field that includes collaboration a lot of that get's lost working from home. Plus I'm a people person anyway and having that in person banter with coworkers is something I miss.I don't answer emails after I'm done work unless it's an emergency. Honestly 95% of emails can wait until tomorrow.It absolutely is my problem, but it's also directly influenced by the environmentI’m kinda glad it’s ripped off the band-aid for me.

Before it seemed weird to invest much in my workspace that I only occasionally use at home (maybe once a week), but I also couldn’t help but wish for improvements.

Suddenly being forced to use it as my one and only work space, it’s actually worth my money to upgrade monitors, get a standing desk, upgrade my wifi, improve my office lighting, etc. I suspect a lot of others will have committed to getting their home space set up properly for WFH as well.A substantial amount of our team was temp laid off, YES those of use who are still working are doing A LOT more work.Actually, it sort of does. In my job things are taking longer than if we were in the office. My company is trying to hold product delivery schedules. In principle I suppose I could work the same hours & accomplish less. 

The reality is that everyone in my company is working harder.This kind of attitude bugs me. There are so many that are currently on lay-off that would kill for a WFH job  and are willing to put in extra work especially in hard time like this. 

And you come online and see whole bunch of people WITH jobs that allows you to work from home and is advocating to people to just put in the usually minimal effort require as if there isn’t an economy recession/hardship happening to the world right now.Two things affect it of course. Percent of space and total expensesmeh, claim a reasonable % and move on to the next item> The ironic thing is... many rich people, born with or without a silver spoon do exactly this. They grab every advantage, tax break, etc out there they can. It’s seen as “being savvy” and somehow people are disapproving of your actions when you probably need it more and are just trying to get by / get a head a little.

Exactly.I'm with you. The people downvoting me are thinking ideologically vs. rationally.

I abide by all laws, pay my taxes, and do my part for the local economy. I employ contractors all over North America. I pay them fair rates. I also make a great income that is taxed to the high heavens.

But yes, I want the tax breaks/advantages that large companies get. They use those advantages to compete - why can't I?No, it's just a joy ride until I walk in the door /s[deleted][deleted]Feel free to punch some numbers into SimpleTax next year and see, but do make sure you understand what is and isn't allowed.As someone who does taxes for multiple people, I agree 83 is not worth it, but holy shit this person is in the minority.
Last week submitted taxes for someone who got 2900 and another 1200Looks like I need to open a shell company...[deleted]Drives me nutsIt’s identifying. But I get a good bit of motivation in more social environments. Want to move cities/ be back home. Job wasn’t worth being away from my roots with covid.The environment that you have created. Not trying to argue but most roles can really be done from everywhere. What I did to help myself. Have a couple places where I can do meetings different from my core work (change of environment) even if it’s a spot/ floor in the house. I work out every morning before looking at my phone. I also schedule in a walk every day into my calendar so people won’t book meetings then. Lastly I eat well too. Hope this helps!Yup it's just so easy to say just separate the two but when there are massive layoffs happening around you and your coworkers are working extra hours too, it's hard to just do 9-5.Excellent point!! I had not considered that. Squeezing a desk into a studio apartment would mean you could subtract 100% of your housing expenses hahaThanks for not reading my comment at all and being reactionary!! I'm totally the bad guy

Those of us that work from home all year even under normal conditions get less than $100 for it... It doesn't cover jack shit.This is a very difficult and historically unprecedented time. It will invariably produce winners and people who are shafted. People are dealing with this in strange ways. There’s grifters too. Sounds like you have a job and your health. Many aren’t that lucky. I don’t know what you want.Put home into shell co name, shell co rents out office space to you in home. Claim business expenses but also pay a dividend to owner of shell co equal to the rent?I use my home workspace to make phone calls and hole remote meetings 🤷‍♂️

Interesting. I still say it's not worth the paperwork hahaMost people will meet the first condition and not be required to meet the other condition.That's part of it. Part of it is also somewhat of peer pressure. Then there's the part where I want my company to succeed. I've agreed to do a certain job & it takes more time. I feel lucky that I'm able to WFH and know compared to other's I'm very lucky.

But it rubs me the wrong way if people can't understand that those of us who are WFH aren't having picnics and making sourdough bread.[deleted]I'm too stupid with this stuff but we're definitely on to something here. Any accountants want to chime in? Lawyers??Yeh ignore me... only one of those conditions need to be met. You’re all good.I get that you're upset, but ranting to me isn't going to help anything. We need you at work. For that to be safe, YOU need as many people as possible to work from home. Would a pay increase really change your situation? What extra costs are you incurring? Life isn't fair, we all are doing what we can to quash this thing and get life back to normal as quickly as possible. I wish minimum wages, and all wages for that matter were higher. I wish taxes on low and medium earners was lower. I've always thought that, the pandemic doesn't change anything it just highlights the problems we always had.You never did explain how you're being shafted. I think you're jealous that some people's careers can be done remotely while yours cannot. That's just a reality of your career, what are we supposed to do about it?All good, thanks for the explanation, didn't have to delete your comment :)I use the app 
And i find it very good 
It’s fast and reliable
Maybe try mobile?what? I use it and have never had an issue, although there certainly is room for improvement. I would call them and tell them these issues.TD has always been good to meI’m also with Investors Edge. I’ve been getting notifications for the last month that they will be improving/relaunching their platform. Maybe those issues have something to do with that?I've used iTrade, Waterhouse and Investor's Edge for the last 10 years.

Investor's edge is no better or worse than the other big 5 banks, and usually pretty good (with iTrade having some better free options like level 2 quotes but also costing more per trade, and Waterhouse which was previously the best now being the worst).

If you want quality go with IBKR, but then you also need to deal with complexity. QuestTrade sucks and it's been documented pretty well on this sub why they suck.People who advise Questrade don't know how much of a clusterfuck they handled the circuit breakers a few months prior. Luckily I switched over to Interactive brokers.Sorry to hear that, 

I have been using  **CIBC Investor's Edge** since 2003 and a CIBC client for over 30 years. 

I'm now a **CIBC Premium Edge** member and I never had these issues before, normally all issues are looked after quickly and efficiently.I’ve never had an issue with my account or both online or app.QtradeAlso been having issues with Investor's Edge lately, both on web and mobile app. A simple sell order change got stuck at "pending" status for 2 days straight and finally fixed itself today. Additionally, I was unable to place regular limit buys as the app insisted I had less cash available than the trade value, despite having (even visibly on screen) MUCH more than needed in cash in my account and all other outstanding trades being settled.

Ever since their latest update stability has been abysmal for me. It's error after error and plenty of hanging/frozen screens. Missed out on a handful of good trades yesterday and spent hours on the phone simply to be recommended I try to reset my password and reinstall the app.

Seems like issues with IE is on a case-to-case basis, as some users get shafted while others have no issues whatsoever. This is the second major inconvenience for me this year, and their customer service is lacklustre. I even reach out to CIBC on Twitter to receive equally unhelpful service.

If this continues, I'm definitely looking to switch platforms. I don't blame you one bit for wanting to do so as well.+1 for Questrade. Great platform that charges lower than typical commissions for stock purchases, no charges to buy ETFs, allows you to reinvest dividends, and will perform Norbert’s gambit to exchange to USD. I have never had a problem depositing or withdrawing funds. I’ve also heard IB is good.I ended up getting through to technical support after waiting on hold for 3:30 hours (!!)

They confirmed the problem was due to technical problems on their end, which are still not resolved, and put in a manual override for me. They told me I'd have to call back the same number and wait every single time something like this happens until the system is fixed.

Excuse me while I move my money elsewhere... Seriously, enough is enough. I've been with these guys for over 10 years and while it's true that they've been solid for 9 out of those 10 years, the past 6 months has been a disaster. I am done losing money due to their technical problems.I'd recommend Wealthsimple Trade instead of investor edge, I've used both and the fees on CIBC were terrible.I dabbled in web development once. My friend recommended a web hosting company which had great reviews online. I tried it and I had tons of error messages/bugs that their support team tried to fix but couldn’t. I learned that sometimes shit happens in the back-end and no one knows why, I recommend you try opening a new account or just move to a different brokerage. Don’t worry about your future mortgage, ~~they will ask you what your assets are at that point.~~ Edit: they just care about your incomeIBKR or Questrade.That’s happened to me and then I realized I had a pending order with those same shares. 

Check your order status page when you get that error, if theirs nothing there than I’d blame CIBC.I had no issues before until they upgraded their trading platform last Friday. A lot of ppl on twitter including myself had technical issues up until today still. I wasn't able to buy or sell, legit lost a lot of money. Thinking of moving to IBKR.CIBC investors edge is very slow right now. I have similar problems and "please wait" and "error"after trying to execute a trade. It was ok a couple weeks ago but they are implementing a bunch of new features which seems to be breaking everything. Just note - If you call in to make a trade, make sure the commission is waved because because they will charge you around $50 per trade.I have been with RBC Direct for 20 years with generally good service. Many do not like them due to having more expensive trade fees ($9.95 each buy or sell) but I see that as an advantage over the lower or no cost services, since the surge in new accounts has likely gone elsewhere and not overloaded RBCs system so much. That is my theory, anyhow.I think its UI is kinda outdated, but I've never had such performance issues.I recently transferred out of investors edge to WS. After trying to actually use the thing for something other than passive mutual funds, I hit a wall of disbelief in about two days. Investors edge is so behind the curve its on the wrong side of hilarious. The site looks like a grey washed version of some mid 90's geocities forum.I like Wealthsimple Trade for my own dabbling... and the core Wealthsimple app for my monthly tfsa contributionsAs much as people shit on Wealthsimple trades simplicity, it gets the job done relatively quicklyJust lost money because of them, tried to sell when the share was dropping and it stuck on "still working on it" then errored out. Same thing with the phone app. Till the time I able to sell I lost $200 moreThere's a note when you log in now: 

>We are currently experiencing technical issues on our trading pages as a result of recent new features added to the platform. We apologize for any inconvenience that you may experience while trying to place trades.

If you try to call there's a message saying that they're experiencing longer than normal hold times.  It's been nothing but trouble since they rolled out the update a few days ago.  Everyone in here claiming that everything with CIBC is hunky dory clearly hasn't been doing much trading recently.Their entire backend is fucked up beyond any hope of proper repair. Its whack-a-mole all day every day.I use tha app, and rarely have an issue. Sometimes. I find my fat fingers cause problems.Move to Think or Swim. It's open to Canadians, has extended trading, and multi-leg options strategies to save commission and protect your gains.What issue are you experiencing right now?I have had no challenges using CIBC Investor Edge, infact I find it better than the other discount broker I use. 20 seconds for a mouse click, no idea where you got that from, I use the platform everyday and its never happened to me. I would suggest check the browser as well you are using, clean the cache and disable cookies etc.I've used their platform for years and years and never experienced anything like that.[removed]their PC platform is indeed a bit outdated, and less responsive than it should be. but their mobile app is definitely a lot better. I've used CIBC investors edge for years now, never had any issues... 

good luck on your search for a new brokerI use IBKR. It's been good to meTOS/IBKR/Questrade over banks.I've never had an issue with Scotia iTrade.I use investors edge. Never had an issueCIBC is Dogshit...  i am in process of moving to IBExperienced silimar issues. Nightmare. Lose big money because of their STUPID platform. CIBC INVESTOR EDGE REALLY SUCKS! Considering other brokerages!RBC is good.Never had any of those issues but yeah that sucks lol..This doesn't help. but I've been using CIBC's Investor Edge with no issues for years. Maybe try using another browser or hte mobile app?I use the app and website, never had any problems buying or selling or setting stop losses.I use TD and I am happy with it! The app and the website haven’t given me any issues.I use TD but I haven't tried anything more advanced than buy or sell yet.Delete the app from your phone and then download a new appWow that’s insane 
Good luck fixing this issueInteractive brokers if you are looking for non-registered accounts. I’ve heard good things about TD and RBC alsoIMO don’t use Investor’s edge. More expensive fees and bad service. If you have small account (<10000) CAD I would use Questrade as fees are slightly cheaper and service is better. 
If account is more than 10k then I would use interactive brokers (who I currently use but have used questrade in past) fees are better and you can trade internationally, cheap margin, best order filling softwareQuestrade or interactive broker dude. Get off that crap. Also TD but I’ve never used it.Try Qtrade.  Thank me later.I've used it to buy stocks in my mom's TFSA about 10 times in the past 2 months and have had zero issues.>I've been unable to buy more than $100 worth of shares with a cash balance of tens of thousands.

Really? Never had an issue. Did you really put in an order for $100 worth of shares? Why?i like rbcs new set up much cleanerI just switched from Investors Edge to WealthSimple. I don’t know if it’s better, but it’s commission free trading.[deleted]I’ve been using CIBC and I don’t mind the app. It’s nothing to fancy but it gets my orders throughI’ve been using CIBC and I don’t mind the app. It’s nothing to fancy but it gets my orders throughI've been trading with TD Advanced Dashboard for 6 months now. Other than regular afterhours maintenance and one instance of a glitch where bid and ask were reversed , it's been working like a dream. It's completely free since I make more than 30 trades per month.I have had zero issues.I haven’t been active on it this week. But when I logged in there is a message saying they have known issues right now. I’m in a holding pattern with my stuff so I haven’t tried anything on it this weekTried to rebalance a few things in an RESP today and received what might be the goofiest error message yet - something along the lines of this 'this account is only authorized to sell'. Tried to call customer service but was still on hold at market close. What a complete fucking joke CIBC is.[removed]I started using Wealthsimple Trade and it is truly awesome - Note: definitely not for trading (althought it's not awful if you set limit orders), its good for just investing. :)Td or questradeAlso use the app and agree with this. I’ve never had an issue with it in 3 years using it.Agree. Been using investors edge for nearly 10 years and not a single complaint. Been buying/selling all week with no errors.The app sucks after the last update. I swear they had 90 day good thru prior and they switched to 30 recently so they can say it's a new feature. The loading time message when you make a trade is bs now as before it was instant. I think they probably programmed something in to make money between the trade and the time the trade is filled. Overall just error after error today trying to make trades.I've spent over 2 hours on the phone. They place you on hold indefinitely.I've also never had these kinds of issues and I've been using them for a long time.

I'm generally hesitant to write off complaints just because I personally have not had issues though. I'd be interested to know if other people had similar issues.

OP might need to have his account closed an reopened to resolve the issue if it's on the back end as he states.Also have been using with no problem. Certainly not the slickest interface but it does the job, for me at least.> there certainly is room for improvement

I don't understand why their trades are STILL so expensive. Like they are competing with FREE trading from various competitors, and they are still stuck at early 2000s prices for buying / selling.The improvements came and are so minor I barely noticed a difference.I found td pretty good as my trades would update real-time. The ui was better. Just didn't want to pay 9.99.>Don't know how much of a clusterfuck they handled the circuit breakers a few months prior. 

Tell us your tale, weary traveler.What has your experience been with premium edge since Monday?Is Premium Edge different from Imperial? They tried to sell me on Imperial years ago but it seemed like an agent pushing high cost products.qtrade is so underrated, fast responsive i'm in and out and does what its supposed to do. dont really know why people bother with questtrade and other things also has live chat for helpLove Qtrade . Works great and easy to use.What about that thread of that guy getting absolutely pummelled by qtradeI can feel what you said as I just experienced similar issues, and I feel frustrated and disappointed to see good purchase and sell opportunities missed. Considering other brokerages.Hey Boss, you know what would be a good idea?

Lets roll out an untested software patch onto our servers during one of the most volatile financial markets in history.

# Sounds good. Also, make sure to do it 1 minute before market opens.[removed]Independent brokerages sound like they're good but moving money away from the bank has two disadvantages:

1. Delays/fees for moving money from bank to brokerage and bank.
2. Loss of negotiating power for your mortgage since you hold less services/money with the bank.

Is TD's brokerage any decent compared to these players?Same story here. I'm glad I'm not the only one putting up with their bullshit.

Imagine being a billion dollar bank and paying six figure salaries to software developers only to have them shit the bed during one of the most volatile markets in history.

I've thought about moving to another platform too. Unfortunately, institutional transfers take multiple weeks. Multiple weeks where you can't buy or sell or cover. This could be a death sentence.Yeah, when I move money on ws I don't even have to worry about it for a weekBanks don’t care about assets when you apply for a mortgage.Plus 1 for IBKRYeah. I had that before, but this isn't the case here. I double-checked to be sure.I am unable to sell shares that I own. I was stuck in a stock while it plunged 5% without being able to do anything. It's recovering slowly now but I am assure you that if it did not CIBC would not refund me the loss.

This kind of software bug is unacceptable.Your account is not old enough

I have over $10,000 in my cash account but Investor's Edge won't let me buy more than $100 worth of stock. This might have worked for you to date but as of Monday they changed the way they calculate available cash and things that used to work simply do not anymore.Your account is not old enough

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/CanadianInvestor) if you have any questions or concerns.*I'd personally prefer a bank just because it makes it easier to transfer money in and out. What's the downside of TD vs QuestTrade?I've tried the Android app. I get the exact same error messages on mobile as desktop. The problem is with their backend.wow, incredible. I have never had these issues.Book a phone appointment with your branch so you don’t have to be on hold forever.Investors edge is $6.95 per trade. Not horrible but ya could be cheaperBecauseIt's a business and no competitor has drastically cut fees.Yeah 90 day good thru, trailing, and some other junk features.https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frz0fp/my_broker_questrade_wants_me_to_sign_an_nda/Good, but I'm mainly a buy and hold investor. I don't trade often so I can't really speak about the service since then but when I do call, I've had no issues. What about you?Premium Edge is a bit different, it's more of "an added service" they offer their HNW customers (e.g. usually those with 1 million or more in assets). If you qualify, talk to someone over at Investor's Edge and ask to get in touch with someone at Premium Edge. 

You may get a dedicated customer service representative that you can call and email but it's not the end-all and be-all, however, it can be useful. 

I noticed that CIBC doesn't advertise it at all. I found out about it because I was also not interested in their Imperial services mainly because agents were pushing their high-cost products and I'm more of a buy and hold indexer.   

Here a rundown of their services:

SELF-DIRECTED INVESTING

* User-friendly trading platform with enhanced analytics tools
* CIBC proprietary research and industry-leading insights
* Tailored performance reporting to track your progress and manage portfolio exposure

RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT

* Personalized service from experienced, knowledgeable investment professionals
* Integrated services to meet Private Wealth Management needs
* Ongoing guided user experience and transaction execution

PREFERENTIAL ACCESS

* Preferred pricing and rates
* Exclusive events and client functions
* Access to Capital Markets thought leadership and advanced solutionsQtrade all the way, any time I had a question i could call them up and talk to a real knowledgeable person over the phone in 2 minutes. Lov it!Yikes, keep it a secret. You don't want everyone flocking there and them becoming like everyone else. That being said my vote is for Qtrade, it is probably the most expensive of the discount brokers but I don't mind compensating for reliability and service.Your account is not old enough

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/CanadianInvestor) if you have any questions or concerns.*I've used TD for years.  I went through a period of time in March when I couldn't call in, but other than that, I have been happy with TD.I used TD for 15 years and have 300k deposit with them for 3 years. Theres no advantage on mortgage etc just bc u have business with them. 

Delay is the biggest pain, but other than that independent brokers r same as bank, but cheaper.Shouldn't be any fees if done correctly.

Besides selling fees that is1. You can’t plan a day ahead for investing?

2.  We get the cheapest rates for mortgages at banks we have no other services with.* An independent brokerage has 1 job, if they do it right, they will survive to see another day, if not they don't.
* Banking in simple terms is take my savings and hold, and lend me money when I need. Perhaps other ancillary services. If they do that and the kitchen sink then you shouldn't be surprised how often they drop the ball.
* I understand why Canadian banks want to get into everything but I don't unerstand the why Canadians reward that. It is almost being captive to their whims.

Answers to your two disadvantages:

1. No fees if you do EFT. Delay is relative and is almost non existend if you do EFT withdrawal via the broker vs use Billpay from your bank
2. That is hypothetical until proven, but if mortgage is a free market then you should be able to find good rate in open market.I wouldn't worry about 2. cause monoline lenders like First National and MCAP seem to offer significantly better mortgage rates than any of the big banksI just opened up a Questrade account over the weekend and bought a couple of ETF's. Transferred the initial $1000 as a bill payment for free. Only took a business day to get the money transferred and the ETF's were free. (OK there was a 10 cent ECN fee for the 30 shares I bought of VEQT)They are not paid multi six figure salaries, unless you take the contract rate

Maybe their most skilled and most experienced get paid over $100k... this isn't Silicon ValleyThey also don't really offer better rates than independent lenders anyway.I hear good things about ibkr but their demo didn't exactly show thatI've had issues todya where it takes a long time to put an order in however I'm semi in the bush right now so I assumed my poor connection was why.I'm having the same issue. You'd be surprised to know that this issue started on Monday....Have your trade settled? How long ago did you buy the stock you intend to sell?I have had that issue trying to sell IBIO this week... ridiculous.Weird. I haven't put in any orders this week. I did see an error message when I logged into my account Monday morning. I have about $80k cash in my accounts right now, if it doesn't work for purchases I'd be pretty upset.

BTW, my question was about your $100 comment, about whether it actually let you put in a tiny order like that.When questrade "gets used to you" money transfers take one day. It did go down a few days during the panic in March, and a lot of people who trade options lost money as they could not buy/sell in time. But if you are a regular buy and hold like myself and not a frequent trade it should not matter.i've never had problems with Questrade, but i've not tried to withdraw my money yet.All trades have a closing date. If you accidentally trade funds that you don’t have available due to the trade not being closed, you will probably encounter an issue. Initially the bank has a grace period, and a trust system where they will allow you to trade money that is still locked up between closing dates, but if you don’t have the funds available then try to buy, they will put you on the shit list. Call them and see what the deal is. I’ve rarely encountered issued on the iphone investors edge app.It's easy to say there's an issue with the back end systems. 90% of the time customers dont even know what the back end systems consist of.Could be free, at least for ETFs.

I mean, $14 to buy and sell a stock isn't going to matter if you are trading huge volumes, but I'd guess it's a deal-breaker for smaller traders.

I wonder what it actually costs them when you trade. Keep in mind your cash is sitting in their accounts interest free too.So how's that whole *legal action* thing going?Thanks, I may try this. I only have about $850k in IE, so not sure if it qualifies.I had good experiences with TD as well. The commissions were just to high for the type of trading I was doing, trading on the app I found was great as well.A friend of mine had a similar experience. How long did it take for TD to come back to normal? Did the hiccup last a day? A week? A month?+1 for this, TD wouldn’t budge on their mortgage rates last year, even though I had been doing all my banking through them for years. Switched to Questrade for investing, a broker for my mortgage and my local credit union for banking. Saved a shit ton of money and I don’t have to rely on their shitty service anymore.How do you save on the fees?Quite the opposite. You need to be able to place multiple orders against the same stock in order to plan ahead.

1. I bought a large amount of stock.
2. I tried to submit a stop-sell order against the same stock to protect myself from massive losses.

CIBC prevented me from submitting the stop-sell order. This is investing 101.

Re: mortgage rates, good to know. That puts my mind at ease.I actually reported the same bug Monday but only escalated it today. Glad to hear I'm not the only one seeing this. I'm on hold waiting for technical support for over 3 hours now.I am dealing with ETFs. Although trades technically settle in 3 days it would be silly to expect traders to wait 3 days to sell a share they bought. Once a purchase is confirmed, you can trade as if it's settled. You just can't cash the money out of the brokerage (which I am not doing).

In the past 10 years I have used this platform I never had these problems. Ever since March 2020 it's been a total disaster.I pulled 35,000$ out at the end of last year, From a TFSA. Had absolutely no issues. Money was in my BMO bank account in 5 working days. I've had no issues at all with it.I've been on the phone for over 2 hours so far. Still on hold.

I am familiar with what you mentioned but right now I am holding shares that I cannot sell. On the one hand they debit my cash account. On the other hand, they refuse to let me submit a sell order even for 1 share claiming that I don't hold any shares.

There is no situation I can think of where this should legitimately happen.I'm a software developer. I have a pretty good idea :)definitely could be cheaper. I have very little cash in my investors edge, I always want it in stocks or ETFs so the interest piece i'd say is moot for most people[deleted]I could not call in for over a month from when my panic set in on March 20.  By the time late April arrived, things had bounced back so it might be just as well I couldn't get through ha!What fees? Sending money to a brokerage should cost you nothing, same with withdrawal. 

Just normal trading commissions you will get anywhere.

I also never had any benefit for their mortgage rates when I did invest with them - its why my mortgage and trading accounts are no longer with them and they are simply where my paycheck goes before I send it elsewhere. (TD)Where would the fees come from? When I set up my questrade account I moved the money over as a bill payment, which my banks don't charge for.Plan ahead as in have money sitting in your brokerage account when you need it.  24 hours is not a big deal if your able to think ahead that far.Independent brokerages sound like they're good but moving money away from the bank has two disadvantages:

1. Delays/fees for moving money from bank to brokerage and bank.
2. Loss of negotiating power for your mortgage since you hold less services/money with the bank.

Is TD's brokerage any decent compared to these players?5 days is an issue for most people. Using a bank broker you can have the money in under 5 minutes.Yikes, that sounds awful. Good luckWow that’s crazy 
I just called them a couple of days ago 
It took Maybe 4 minutes to reach someone.
Have you tried walking into a branch,
They are usually very helpful,
Although it’s kind of annoying going to branch it might be worth it.Ya you can put through trades on the TD, it's just basic but if you need to buy or sell when no access to a computer it's helpful.It's pretty hard to \*think far ahead\* when the stock market is bouncing double digits in the span of minutes.

Also you forget its their literal job to make sure their platform is functioning correctly. This is why they get paid the big bucks.There’s no fees for moving money into and out of Questtrade.  Banks don’t care about the business you have with them, it is not security so they won’t lower your mortgage rate.  In fact you are much less likely to get a good rate through one of the big five than other options.  Banks have no loyalty.> Delays/fees for moving money from bank to brokerage and bank.

i've been using questrade and completed lots of transfers. Standard T+1 / 2 transaction processing has always been the case. Never had to pay a penny for any transfer.

> Loss of negotiating power for your mortgage since you hold less services/money with the bank.

sure, if you're "significant". Most people are not. "significant" means (usually) north of $5 million.Yeah true, if it's the same bank you bank with. Unless I'm wrong you can't do a $35,000 same day transfer, between institutions.I spoke with the branch. It took them over 24 hours to get someone to call me back. Not great.24 hours lol, that's what it takes to transfer in money.Politics aside, I wish Canada WAS less dependant on oil for one reason specifically. 

It's just too damn volatile. How dependant our economy is in one sector is just a terrible thing, regardless of your views on climate change/etc. If oil goes down, our whole economy suffers. If oil is up, then it's gravy times.

Wish there was a push to expand to other sectors here. Canada's economy is too dependant on real estate, the financial sector, and oil. Not a whole lot else is a major factor, and I'm not sure how to fix that.This is r/canadianinvestor so let’s think about implications for market and stocks and keep politics to those subs. Some thoughts: 
- Less investment in Canada, primary in form of mining and O&G construction, engineering, finance, etc, which will be net negative to those services  
- Robust regulatory environment will favour larger companies who can make investments into clean energy and regulatory teams required for investment. This will in turn likely lead to more consolidation in industry over time, or accelerate consolidation currently in place due to low commodity prices (in case of O&G)
- Current midstream and mining reserve assets became worth more because less supply coming online in future. Pipelines will be able to charge higher rates over long term though volumes will go down. Probably net good for Midstream pipelines as higher rates = higher margins.
- higher volume shipped through other channels, increasing demand for rail and long-haul transportation. This will also lead to higher long-term differential on WCS over WTI, which will hurt Canadian producers 
- clear policy and certainty for markets can also sometimes be positive (even if policy is negative to markets, uncertainty is worse). And let’s be real, it’s not like new pipelines were really getting green light under this regime.

All-in-all, if I were investing in Canadian O&G and mining, this would make me favour ‘diversified’ and mid-stream companies over pure play upstream E&P or volume-based services.Just means there won't be investment (in Canada). The money will be invested someplace else.'net zero' investmentsAssuming most mines can come up with some plan on paper. I wouldn’t be too concerned about this news. Mines (gold) will be crucial to recovering our economy.Canadian oil and gas companies most definitely will "show the path to net-zero emissions by 2050", but highly unrealistic one. And it will be approved. Basically government  creates virtue-signalling regulations and companies respond with virtue-signalling commitments. Neither is intend to follow thru since neither PM nor CEOs will be holding a bag in 2050 or evaluated by their actions on that front.

So, net effect: ZERO change. It is very similar to what Soviet Union had as "official declarations", for example "apartments for all Soviet families by year 2000".

It cannot be otherwise from any practical point of view.

Canada, as a member of WTO and numerous trade pacts, cannot establish trade tariffs to block polluting companies from importing their goods and services into Canada. It means that real tough environmental laws will trigger resource extraction and any other 'non-zero emission' economical activity to shift to countries where environment protection is lower.300 billion in federal debt this year, how are we gonna expect to recover from this when investment in our industries is being scared away.Meh a 2050 target is just some political bullshit. Who know what will happen in the next 30 years.Stick a fork in 'em. They're done.

God damn these fucking Liberals.Hah, you can mine coal, but you must do it with an electric truck.Hopefully this drives the movement of funds towards sectors that can foster growth as our world continues to move towards being less reliant on oil and gas. 

This sucks for Alberta and Saskatchewan, but the thing is the underlying issue is beyond just government policies in Canada. Global oil gasses have tanked, and are going to continue to tank or remain artificially low as you see areas like the Middle East and the US creating massive supply-demand shortfalls. 

If I’ve been at a blackjack table for a couple hours, I’ve gotta have the wits to know whether continuing to play more hands is worth it or not. I might have a little more fun, but more likely than not I’m gonna feel pretty shitty in a few hours as I’m leaving the casino, kicking myself for not getting up from the table earlier - that extra money could have gone towards to a multitude of different, more value added, long term projects.I’m literally just starting a long position in ENBRIDGE .. should I maybe reconsider ? (My horizon is 20+ years)[removed]Good News for existing pipeline companies!Interesting timing considering some very recent moves in Alberta that look to position a lot more of the Rockies and foothills for coal mining.Seems like the path to the industry being nationalized is on its way.Really means nothing. Most major players are already doing it. Canada is late to this party.Agreed.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_curse

Basically the story of AlbertaRun for publice officeRespectfully, politics and investing in markets do go hand in hand. I do understand where you’re coming from though.I've been holding and recommending diversified and mid-stream companies since the COVID/OPEC+ crises hit.  Folks that need politicians to tell them what they want to hear should let others manage their money - the writing's been on the wall for quite some time now, and the major players are making the necessary moves, if perhaps a bit slower than we'd like to see.Green energy that’s what Canada should be working towards - my own opinion thoYeah the emissions come from another country - just not here. But the liberals will pay themselves on the back.I'm a left wing person but everyone here seems to be assuming that there won't be several conservative governments in the next 30 years. There likely will. Also that the liberals in the future won't be hard centrists, which they may be.CNRL, Shell, Cenovus, Teck, and MEG Energy have all committed to achieving net-zero emissions in the future (some of them said by 2050, some said they're still determining a target date).Sooooo any idea how that plan will look on paper?  Buying carbon credits to offset?  About the only thing I can think ofdont worry clearly we've also shown a path that by 2050 the budget will balance itself no need to do anything /sGlobal climate is so much more important and real than the budget will ever be. This should be happening by 2030.There are unlimited millionaires coming to GVA and GTA to buy million dollar houses. That’s how money will be madeWe could start thinking about new industries and try to support and grow them before Germany and the US eat everyone's lunch on an even bigger scale.  The thing about change is it happens whether you like it or not, you can try to prepare for it by making your own changes or you can sit on your hands and wait for it to hit you full on in the mouth.Trudeau!Yeah, uninnovative companies that have seen the environmental writing on the wall for decades and did nothing are done. They *should fail*. Let capital creators with actual skill and foresight take their place.The whole first world is and has been moving to reduce carbon.  It’s not Canada’s Liberals’ fault.  In 2050 the World’s political landscape will look entirely different, and all political parties worldwide will most probably be environmentally conscious.  
It appears that the Liberals are attempting to encourage diversification and innovation during the infancy of this global movement so that when the year 2050 rolls around we have industry leaders instead of dying companies.2050 is a long time for ENB to transition to other sectors beyond oil pipelines, and have been doing so already for quite a while. Every year, more of their revenue is coming from natural gas and renewable energy projects. I wouldn't sweat it too much.Enbridge and other major players have been investing in a lot of other energy projects (non-pipeline ones). I think its still a good play for the long term. I am personally invested in TC Energy (I like the assets they have more) and they have actively been working on reducing emissions/improving environmental footing more and more. They also have a huge utility business. Natural gas is going to be around for a long time yet IMO.Your account is not old enough

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/CanadianInvestor) if you have any questions or concerns.*we tried that once. it didn't work. why do we want this untrustworthy government to manage one more thing when they clearly are struggling with everything elseIt's scary. Now I am in support of climate change policies, and I also believe Canada should be enacting those policies. Climate change could result in much bigger issues than just the price of oil, but that's another topic for another subreddit. Also, Canada alone legislating new regulations on a global scale is fairly minor. It's going to take an effort on many major countries to really have any sort of effect.

However, I also think oil will be around to stay for at least 30-50 more years on a major scale, but what does happen in the future when oil becomes worthless? What will we do to make up that loss of revenue?

Really a scary thought honestly on a few different levels.Somewhat. Essentially you don't want to *only* be an exporting country because you end up selling resources for cheap and have to purchase most manufactured goods. All things considered it's better to be a manufacturing nation or even better a hub for services or wealth. Look at Singapore - it imports everything and has no natural resources."I'm not sure how to fix that" probably wouldn't be the best election slogan. May have to work on that first :pYou only win if rich people want you to win :(Totally agree it’s gray, and get it considering this sub is heavily titled to O&G exposure. My comment was more targeted at the very low value comments like “g** d*** f*** these liberals” (yes, that was actually a comment) which don’t add any investment value and are better suited elsewhere. They do this in the non-Canadian focused investing subs (using judgment) and IMHO it results in better content.Sure. There is already a lot of investment in green energy. I think it's wrong to assume that making it impossible to invest in conventional energy in Canada will do much to boost green energy in Canada though. There will be a slight uptick in green investment, but more realistically the vast majority of investment moves to other more friendly jurisdictions (e.g. the u.s.)Personally I thought it was hilarious when people suggested Alberta leave Canada because if they did then Canada would have less emissions. Everyone could finally cheer "GREAT JOB GUYS, WE MADE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE CANADA IS SO GREEN NOW." Never mind net global emissions and oil consumption wouldn't change much.Ah yes, so we should all just give up on the fight against the biggest crisis facing the planet.I didn't say there wouldn't be. My comment is specific to the current context.

That said, it is very very easy to lose investor confidence and much harder to win it back. One of Canada's strongest historical assets is it's stability in both political and economic terms. We take that for granted. 

Don't get me wrong, maybe we need this, but it's going to cost us in prosperity in the short to medium term for sure.Doesn't matter. When business leaves, it rarely comes back.I’m sure they can hire many creative minds to compile combination genuine and more speculative assumptions and forecast into a business case. Here’s a few I just thought of in 10 min: 
- carbon offsets or capture 
- increased clean energy investment 
- scale of operations, bringing down carbon overhead impact of each incremental mine or pipeline 
- commitments to wind down less efficient operations or converting older infrastructure or machinery to higher efficiency newer models 
- retrofitting offices, mine lodges (for lack of better word) with better HVAC and insulation
- allowing employees who can to work from home when possible (already in progress), to decrease carbon footprint 
- reducing corporate travel (already in progress) and hire more locally (resulting in less emissions flying people in and out)
- automate equipment, to require lower workforce at mines or pipelines, requiring less air travel for people, food and supplies (already there are companies like CAT making automated mine equipment)

Edit: given downvote maybe this all comes off as a bit airy fairy but It’s surprising how much little things like HVAC and refrigeration can have on carbon emissions. A lot of this is already in the works and could easily be put in a plan.Funny thing is this holds these industries to a higher standard than literally any other industry with these rules. It would be hard for most companies to do this.Disagree, if we mismanage funds we will go back to using the cheapest highest polluting options later down the road. Going green is usually cost intensive and comes at the expense of operating some money making industries. If we go too far one way and run out of money there will be a push back and people will rubber band back the other way.    
     
There's also the issue that if we increase our green restrictions too much the industries just shift to other countries with horrid practices. This means a net loss to the environment even though we get to say we have very good restrictions.     
      
Everything is a balance and if anyone doesn't see that then they just aren't looking at the whole picture.That's fine. But set a realistic target and fund research into clean energy

Except it's just all talk and for scoring browny points with their constituentsGet real.  This is a country built on natural resource extraction, and in the grand scheme of things Canada is just a minor player when it comes to pollution and impacting climate change.  This is nothing but nonsense to satisfy low IQ people like you and environmental terrorists, while scaring off investment and ultimately reducing the quality of life and economic standing of this country.So comepletely destroy our economy but also become a country with net zero emissions? Great we just removed 1.6% of world emissions, the world is saved.Except it won’t be happening anytime soon. Solar and wind aren’t good enough. The combined most effective and efficient form of energy is natural gas, which has only 1/3 the emissions as other fossil fuels. Investment in that is being destroyed. We aren’t going to be off of oil for a long time and forcing companies to be less competitive just hurts Canada.Easy to say with a full belly.Lets just shut down all our oil infrastructure and buy from Saudi and other countries. That'll show em how green we are.Wow a bunch of fucking assholes responding to you. 35 degrees 75% of the time ain’t normal people open your fucking eyes.They are coming here and buying real estate to shelter their fortunes from the tax man. Someone buying a five million dollar house in Toronto doesn't significantly boost the economy.They don’t pay tax on home sales since we have an ‘honour system’.The thing about change is that it *needs* an actual plan, not useless rhetoric. You harp about how change happens whether we like it or not...and? What are Canadians going to throw away multi-hundred billion dollar industry for? What is the plan? What can Canada, traditionally a natural resource-driven economy, reasonably diversify into at a time when the country is approaching $1 trillion in debt?> Yeah, uninnovative companies that have seen the environmental writing on the wall for decades and did nothing are done. They should fail.

They're being actively killed by government regulations being pushed to satisfy eco-terrorists and low IQ lefties.  These companies are not "uninnovative" in the slightest, unless you're planning to drop any and everything relating to O&G, including transportation, plastics, etc because there's some genius "innovative" solution out there to substitute all of these items.  Get a clue.Yet carbon emissions have still grown over the last 5 years, and will continue to grow for the next 50. 

I wonder how much oil and gas they’re going to need to manufacture this “green transition” that keeps getting spouted on about. It’s laughable.honestly, make it so it doesn't affect us. Build semiconductor fab plants, make solar cells. Build more solar panel manufacturers. Build lithium refineries. Repurpose our empty auto plants to make electric drivetrain vehicles -- buses, cars, and trains. (Still mad about Bombardier's asinine shortsighted policy to sell trains and keep jets?!) Finally, build the facilities to recycle these products at end-of-life. 

That's how you wean off oil. We know from history that new industries need to be subsidized by the government to get a foothold. From Canadian canola to South Korean steel, new blue-sky industries can't form without some collective seed capital. We just need to stop dicking around and get it done.It's literally how it works. Just like buying oil from countries with a worse record of caring for the environment than Canada. Buying from the middle east is horrible vs in Canada for track record of giving a shit about the enivronment.Net global emissions stay the same, and we'd probably end up buying oil from Alberta at some point anyway.Ya imagine telling businesses that every 4 years when Canadians elect a different party, their businesses will be unprofitable until we elect Cons again. That's a terrible business plan and they'll leave for good.This is a great response. Regulatory bodies are slow to respond and oversight is generally pretty weak in this sector. A good plan on paper will make it through an approval process and they can get away with a lot from there on. This is coming from personal experience working for an oversight body.

Prime example, look at the administration of orphan gas and well funds across the provinces. BC and Alberta are good cases. The regulatory bodies didn't adjust deposit requirements even though it was common knowledge that the deposits weren't anywhere close to covering potential liabilities in the event of a downturn in the industry (something that was obviously coming for many years). Even as companies were going bankrupt (also for years), they didn't react. Both provinces are now on the hook for millions in remediation costs.We don't need to find research. We have all the technology. We need to /switch/ to renewables and /stop exporting dirty energy/. If not for Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada would have met it's Copenhagen targets. The emissions from those provinces that made this feat impossible are from oil and gas extraction.> In the grand scheme of things Canada is just a minor player when it comes to pollution and impacting climate change

So everybody else should make efforts but not us?  It’s like saying ~~Edmonton~~ St-Eustache should not have to pay taxes because in the "grand scheme of things it’s just a minor player".

Edit : Edmonton was a bad example, but take any small city and my argument standsChrist, you're one of those people that double-parks and then points out another asshole double-parked as though your mistake isn't a problem. 
Climate change isn't a /binary/ issue. It's a continuous one. It's not like we either do or do not destroy the world. We have and are continuing to destroy the ecosphere (which means earth's carrying capacity, which means how many people can happily survive on this planet). Every tenth of a degree we raise global temperatures has a serious implication for the amount of food shortages and thus climate refugees and civil wars we see. 

Per capita Canada is one of the top 3 emitters in the world. We are one of the most guilty nations on earth for this problem. 

Alberta makes more tax money from gambling and liquor than oil and gas. 
This will not completely destroy the economy. It will change it. Smart businesses will change into actual anergy companies that literally deal in more than one kind of energy. The tar sands are doomed long-term anyway.Don't forget, to make solar, you need a mine to supply the materials lol.> 35 degrees 75% of the time ain’t normal people open your fucking eyes.

And this is why hyperventilating, clueless morons like you are an absolute joke.The irony of your comment is astounding.  I'm in Alberta and you know who shares your attitude on doubling down on failing industry jobs?  Jason Kenney.  
And you know what 3 of the 4 credit ratings companies that downgraded Alberta's credit in the last year alone said?  That Jason Kenney and the UCP HAS no economic plan for Alberta other than tripling down on a declining job market in Oil and Gas.  We are sending record amounts of oil outside the province every year but there's no increase in jobs being generated by that growth in exports.  
You are exactly the type of person to perpetuate this problem because you don't understand profits and volume of any base export no longer have a connection to jobs.  You know who the government gets most of their tax revenue from?  People with jobs.

So tell me, what is YOUR plan?  Seriously I want to know.  Does it even include creating more jobs?  Or is it just based on increasing the profit margin of companies?  Your answer will give me what your actual perspective is on the topic of having plans for the future.  I'm trying to get through your rhetoric here.Yeah, Canada definitely is telling the Middle East and US to have production at such high levels so as to kill the price. The sector is simply unprofitable in Canada. It’s so much cheaper to pull out oil in other places over the world. The only way things could be different would be to not only lift all regulations, but to actively invest in the sector. This ship is on a fire and pumping more money in is not going to help apart from keeping the fire going on a little longer. 

When you have a gangrenous foot, you amputate it and get a prosthetic - it’s not something you wanna hear but it’s what needs to happen. Facts are facts.> Net global emissions stay the same

that's the punch line> We need to /switch/ to renewables and /stop exporting dirty energy/

And, oh genius one, what is your plan to make up for the hundreds of billions that O&G and mining contribute to our economy?  Easy to push useless, feel-good platitudes like "go green" without a practical plan.we can produce renewable energy all we want but how do we cleanly consume them?

Biggest problem with energy is transfer and storage. 

Non renewable solves both in itself.

Battery tech is still decades away from real mass adoption, you can't convince me to go on a long haul drive with a Tesla. Producing and disposing battety is also not clean, so we need a radically new way to transport and store energy.

Again, government should help fund research into these problems.Shooting yourself in the foot economically is not exactly encouraging the big boys at the table to follow your example.In terms of CO2 emissions per square kilometer (because the planet doesn't care about per person just total co2), Canada is in the top 5 lowest emitting countries in the world. We already 'made' an effort by keeping our population low.  

The best thing would be ending immigration then.The mindset in this thread is frightening. Let's make no effort in the face of total annihilation.How do you think Albertans pay for gambling and liquor? Oh right, they work in oil and gas. The money doesn't magically appear.

And Canada is a sparsely populated country with a harsh artic environment. Of course we're going to emit more than densely populated nations with a fair climate.

And while I'm a strong proponent of renewable energy, destroying the industry that will help to pay for it is ridiculous. Someone will extract the oil and resources and then sell it to Canada. We just won't make any money on it.I’m a realist, as soon as the government shows me a plan for replacing the 10% of gdp that oil and gas supplies I’m all for it. I don’t think you understand how much revenue from our resources trickle down, from the auto industry to restaurants if we didn’t have oil and gas and other natural resources we would be a third world country.invest in Cubic Farms #problemsolvedWell said thank you.Per square km Canada is in the top 5 LOWEST emitters in the world. The planet cares about fixed denominator, not variable ones like per person. 

In a world of growing population, the world still is fucked if we lower co2 per person. Congrats, you stated the coldest country in the world is in the top 3 per person. NO SHIT! But we compensate by keeping population low. The solution is ending immigration and reducing our population IF we want to do anything, which by per sq km, we don't need to.And it only works during the day. At night you’re using fossil fuels lol.Ignore the hive mind champ. I must be a clueless moron because I don’t understand your point. I’m freaking out because the world is cooking itself and that’s a bad thing? Sorry I’m such a moron I legitimately can not follow this.That's it? Your response is "what is YOUR plan?" Come on dude, what is Alberta going to diversify into, and why does it have to happen overnight? You're the one proposing the change in status quo here, so please tell us why Canada's O&G industry has to get canned when Canadians cant even figure out what to diversify into yet.

(Also, when national debt is at record levels)> The sector is simply unprofitable in Canada. 

I don't care what your environmental stance is, but if you believe this statement, then I believe you have no idea how to read a balance sheet. That's sad because this is an investment subreddit.> Yeah, Canada definitely is telling the Middle East and US to have production at such high levels so as to kill the price. The sector is simply unprofitable in Canada.

LMAO, what? The price of WCS is $34/barrel right now, and it costs Suncor $10/barrel to produce. 

Source: https://www.oxfordenergy.org/publications/the-canadian-oilsands-and-strategic-approaches-to-profitability/

> Figure 6 shows the cash costs per barrel for selected major oilsands players between 2013 and 2017. Cash cost per barrel (CCB) is the cost of operating the facility, including commodity costs – usually natural gas and chemicals – and other operations costs, such as maintenance activities, operating expense projects, waste disposal and functional support. Bitumen-heavy producers have achieved significant cost reductions over the last five years. Cenovus, for example, produced a barrel of bitumen for C$8.40 in 2017, while Husky produced one for C$11.27. In addition, although Suncor’s overall oilsands cash costs are over C$20 per barrel due to mining and upgrading, its in-situ facilities combined to produce bitumen for under C$9 per barrel.Canadian oil majors have been turning huge profits over the last 4 years. Oil is far from unprofitable in our country.

If anything the government is making it more and more unprofitable with all the bureaucracy they pile on year after year.> the hundreds of billions that O&G and mining contribute to our economy

[citation needed]

I'd be very surprised to learn that new O&G assets are even profitable in 2020 without subsidies.

edit: 8 people have swung through to downvote but can't back up their beliefs.

Keep doing what all the other investors are doing :)Don't forget, renewable energy NEEDS FUCKING METAL! LOL. Can't have renewable energy with no mining producing materials to make green energy. LOL it's a massive joke.That's pretty misleading as half our extremely large  country is a frozen wasteland.CO2 per square kilometre is meaningless. It's the people who are generating the CO2, so the planet does care. Just so happens we're among the highest in the world at that.Cut out Alberta and Canada is actually pretty low for per captia emissions. It's oil sands and mining that is incredibly dirty, not because we need a little more heat then other countries. Ontario is the leader otherwise, but is trending downward.

How is someone else going to extract Canada's resources exactly?? If they operate here they will have to follow the same regulations as Canadian companies. Unless you're imagining a "drink your milkshake situation" where the US drills diagonally under the border>Come on dude, what is Alberta going to diversify into, and why does it have to happen overnight?

That's the lie though isn't it, people like you have been saying that for 30 years.  Peter Lougheed talked about people like you making the Oil sands a cluster fuck all the way up til 2010, and people like you ignored him, even though he's literally the reason we even have the Oil sands.

There's been alterantatives pushed here for 20 years to diversify the economy and always rejected if they aren't a get rich quick scheme, the NDP actually had some good ones, and here we are with people like you and race to the bottom trickle down economics, and where is that prosperity, it's going to the rich in foreign countries as Alberta has had for 30 years the lowest royalty rates in the world, and where is Alberta?  With a projected 25% unemployment, given by Jason Kenney himself as a up coming possibility, 15-20% guaranteed.  You clearly have no answers and are not here for debate, you just want to parrot trickle down talking points.  Reality is not on your side.  Don't feel to busted though, the majority of people in Alberta think like you, now they are feeling the consequences of those attitudes.I not only mis-spoke but I was completely wrong. You’re right, pulling hydrocarbons out of the ground still turns a profit. 

While I don’t agree in taking steps to further inshrine this industry in the future of Canada’s economy, what I said was false, this sector turns a profit and without a doubt people are going to invest in places that make money. 

I personally don’t invest in this sector, because I’ve been able to make a lot more money in other things, and I hope the federal government doesn’t invest here either (and instead makes a lot of money in other sectors).Honestly thank you for this information! I’ll be completely honest, I was talking out of my ass there. I was wrong, those metrics show profitability. 


I don’t believe in putting tax dollars towards the oil and gas sector, and that’s not going to change. If Alberta wants to but Alberta money in the oil sector do it, but I hope the federal money helps Alberta transition to different industries that can last and THRIVE for the next century and beyond. Really cool to see the industry becoming more efficient though! I hope the fiscal efficiencies also translate to efficiencies in methods of extraction.FYI cash costs are not all in sustaining costs. It's literally only the cost to produce the barrel, then you have admin costs, capex costs, etc etc. Suncor is breaking even right now, but this price won't stay for ever.You’re right it’s profitable. What I said was false! Maybe I should just delete my original comment.. hmm 


I definitely want the federal government to continue to make it hard to pull oil out of our land. I want to see oil and gas become an unprofitable sector (it never will though). I want to see regulations that give an advantage and reward sectors that have a +1 in terms of the environment. I want to see investments in research and environmentally neutral sectors over industries that have a net -1 to the environment. I want these changes today, not in 2050.https://www.capp.ca/economy/canadian-economic-contribution/

I normally wouldn’t even reply to white knight childish posts like this but for you I’ll make an exception. Oil and gas is our largest export, a 5 second google search will show you its also one of our most profitable industries. I realize you’ve formed your opinions based on feelings rather than facts seeing as world oil consumption and demand has been climbing for decades. Trying to say it somehow doesn’t contribute to our economy is honestly laughable.

Your whole argument is completely backwards as it’s renewable energy that is being sustained purely based off of subsidies (again, actual research as opposed to feelings will show you this). Oil and gas is one of the least subsidized industries in Canada, with a carbon tax introduced in Quebec in 2007 and rolled out federally in 2018. Compare that to the billions spent on our green infrastructure program, energy innovation program, the zero emission vehicle incentive...etc. 

Whether we should continue pursuing oil investment in the future is another topic entirely, but to say we currently don’t need it or “it’s not sustainable without subsidies” is just blatant ignorance.Ok, fair, do the math, cut our SQ KM in half and see how we fall. We would also have to do that for other countries. Determine CO2 per liviable sq km. 

If we double our co2 per sq km, we are still 79/92 for highest co2 per sq km without accounting for other countries non livable sq km. https://www.careourearth.com/the-list-of-countries-ranked-by-co2-emissions-per-square-kilometer/  

my point still stands. 

EDIT: UMADBRO? Salty environmentalists don't like facts that says Canada is great.If you had 10x the population like USA (since canada is bigger area) but cut co2 per person in half, we would be emitting more total co2. Yes? Thats bad. 

Co2 per person encourages population growth but kills the planet. We are the coldest country, if you want us being the best co2 per person emitter, we would all have to kill ourselves. Thats what you want?> but this price won't stay for ever.

Yeah, the price of oil can go up and Suncor will make even more money.Well, you've gone straight to the insults, how pleasant. I bet you even think you're a nice person :)

To address the content of your post, one fallacy at a time:

Your cite, the website of a petroleum advocacy group, makes the (unverified) claim that the industry adds $108B to the country's GDP. Sounds great, right? Let's dig deeper.

1. In 2018, the industry added $108B to GDP despite only taking in $101B in direct revenues. Two possibilities here: the $108B number comes from the direct disbursements from oil companies, in which case they lost $7B in 2018. Not exactly supporting your argument. The other possibility (more likely) is that they've tried to calculate the contribution to GDP from all downstream spending (e.g. not just producers but the companies that supply them, their employees' personal spending, etc.) But if *that* only adds $108B off $101B income? That's the worst multiplier I've ever come across. Any other industry's multiplier is somewhere between 150% and 500% -- but here we're supposed to be happy about 107%? Not a ringing endorsement.

2. The industry claims to be paying $17B over ten years in taxes (including royalties). That's $1.7B per year. Sounds great, but [they get $3.3B per year in direct subsidies from the federal government alone.](https://d36rd3gki5z3d3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Fossil-Fuel-Subsidies-EN.pdf?x13805) This industry costs us all to keep it afloat. Would they even still be profitable without the $1.6B++ gift? 

3. All current fossil fuel assets are sunk costs. Of course they're bringing in revenues -- they're already built. Capex costs significantly outweigh O&M costs in this sector: once you've built it, it prints money until the oil deposit runs out. But this is irrelevant for new projects, where we can still decide if they're worth building at all. That's what I said in the post you downvoted and insulted: 
> I'd be very surprised to learn that **new** O&G assets are even profitable in 2020 without subsidies.

4. (#3, continued) We already know that the TMX pipeline can't possibly turn a profit. Since it's public, we have a good idea of the costs and expected revenues. I'd love to see some examples of actual proposed private O&G capital investments, their costs and their expected revenues. I'd be happy to look at some examples of projects that private companies actually want to build -- if you can find any :)

5. All profitability of any fossil fuel investment anywhere rests on one huge, unavoidable assumption: that we're going to keep letting people dump their waste for free. No other industry gets a free pass. You can't pour chemicals in the rivers, you can't dump heavy metals on the earth. Why do fossil fuel fanboys think their free ride will last forever? [Every tonne of CO2 released costs society $417.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0282-y) That's the cost today, and it rises as more CO2 is released. At [430 kg per barrel of oil combusted,](https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gases-equivalencies-calculator-calculations-and-references), and a total of [709 kg CO2 per barrel of bitumen once extraction costs are included](https://www.pembina.org/blog/real-ghg-trend-oilsands), that alone amounts to an indirect subsidy of $274 per barrel of bitumen. That is one hell of an exposure to one hell of an unjustified assumption: that society will continue to let you destroy it in pursuit of profit. 

IMO, it's a terrible fucking bet -- but discussing this kind of analysis is what this subreddit is about. I'm sure you'll go back and look at your ^"stonks ^always ^go ^up" fossil fuel consumption trend charts and feel happy with your investment choices :)Honestly not gunna read any of that, the govCan website reflects identical info to the website I posted so trying to “debunk” that oil somehow isn’t generating revenue for the country is again, laughable.

As I said, there is an argument for whether oil is a sustainable choice in the future. But that wasn’t what you were originally arguing. Pretending things are the way you want them to be isn’t a discussion.Maybe you should read the post then, if you think that's what it's about.

Here's a hint: I used the numbers from your cite.

Being able to look past the initial presentation to see the underlying details is an important part of investing. Every executive wants their company to look as good as possible; you need to be able to read their reports and figure out what they're not saying.Just playin devils advocate here. It's not like much good content gets buried though. I'd say we have a problem with lack of good content rather than an overload of bad content. I'm gonna hazard a guess without looking that you don't make many DD posts here and want to see other people put more effort into posts. I too would love to see high quality stuff but since im not willing toput the effort in why should i criticeze. I think getting some quality posts is necessary before we tell half the current posters to step up or step out.I'm a little shy, but would you mind rating my portfolio as well...take it easy on me ;)

https://imgur.com/a/c1DOf18Hey, can you rate my portfolio -

100% VGROI agree. I was about to make a post about how we're becoming /r/ratemyportfolioI think they should be posted in the daily thread. It is getting excessive.I’ve been doing my DD on XGRO it’s been 4 months now. I’ve just got 5430 holdings left to research.
I’m getting ready to buy soon.Can we just make a bot that says "Why didn't you just buy VGRO?" That's basically the appropriate response to those that aren't really putting effort or research into their portfolio.Discussing it with the mods, may look at alternative options since we can only sticky 2 posts but there is probably something that can be done here.Most of these postings are becoming wsb. They are either meme stocks or vgro. If this is done only show holdings, no price, amount, and profit gain/loss; no need to rub that into anyone's face.I posted a legitimate question about subscription receipts with details about the issue and share price and didn't get a single response. Not even someone saying wtf are you talking about idiot. Not a thing. Meanwhile the shit posts get tonnes of attention. It's not just the OPI don't think it's good

It's usually because they made bad picks or had huge losses so they're already pretty embarrassed to post it anyway

They should be encouraged to post it so people can say how awful it is so they can shape up (shape up for most people being get out of the game and buy VGRO lol)Can we get a megathread for posts complaining about no megathread for “rate my portfolio” posts?My portfolio is down 0.032% since I started 3 days ago. What am I doing wrong?Who cares man? Not like this sub is that busy anyway. Just let people post.I'll take those threads over the millionth post about how our lord and saviour VGRO is so great.Agreed. Better yet, limit it to a day a week.Agreed. It's even more annoying when the OP clearly hasn't done any research and is asking for advice (like that guy who's portfolio was like 90% weed stocks). These people are the equivalent of guys who think they're good enough to play in the NBA but haven't even played in a rec league before.

Word to those new at investing, read, study and learn the fundamentals first before you actually put money into the market.100% ZHY.toI yolo dumped 100k into FVI in march at 3 bucks, it is now up 300%. Should i sell? Or yolo to the moon?These posts are the PFC equivalent to “I have 50K I inherited from my dogs uncles trust fund, what should I do with it?”Cant wait to never click on thatHonestly would be fine with a total ban. Pretty much all of them are utter garbage, full of meme stocks, no diversity, and made with no due diligence whatsoever besides "it's the future" or "its grown a lot already".Rate my portfolio 100 percent vgroI downvote that mundane garbage every time I come across one. Confining them to a thread would be an improvement.Guys roast my portfolioI find it fun....[deleted]I'm kinda on this same side. As a relatively new follower/investor, i started following this sub to try to learn. Feels like a bad idea -- sub seems to be bordering on toxic sometimes and not really conducive to learning more than half the timeI think 99.99% of people don't make DD posts here man. I just feel like every "investing" subreddit is slowly becoming wsb/penny stocks esque with how people just beg for get rich quick adviceYou should never criticeze imoCan't wait to backtest it ;)Best portfolio post yetSolid portfolio!Looks solid. Amazing color scheme with a nice classic look. You are going places. Keep me updatedLooks like it has some attitude.Need more vgroThose are rookie numbers. Need to use margin to bump that up to ~150%Should add TEC.Since COVID hit, this sub has quickly transitioned into a better-written WSB/BSB, albeit usually avoiding the bragging and memes that make those subs what they are. Scrolling by new, half of the posts are attempted pumps for below-averave stocks with little-to-no DD. These recent posts are further movement along the WSB path.wtf are you talking about idiot.Should I buy the dip?Sure, it’s bad.because I removed them allThere were like 10 this morning before they were all removed by the modsSame here. I came here expecting insightful advice but ended up seeing a lot of posts that make me raise an eyebrow.I'd rather have these posts than the daily garbage asking what ETF to buy... this is all the sub has become: what ETF I should buy?It has always been like this. People don’t generally put public DD out there without any financial motive and that can include pumping their own holdings, which is the only thing approaching DD we see on this sub.

You’d have better luck with analyst reports if DD by other people is your thing.Well if you're not willing to put effort into posts then you're in no position to criticize others? Damn straight this is a low effort sub but complaining is going to do jack shit.Yo, a Canadian wsb would be the shitWize wordsWhoa easy there, this is a family friendly subreddit!!!Couldn’t agree moreadded more VGRO...

New portfolio - 

100% VGRO. How do i add more bonds with only VGRO?If you see treasure, bury itr/justbuyvgro must be offendedThats like saying someone who subscribes to a newspaper cant say the quality is poor just because they dont write any articles./r/BaystreetbetsKingstreetbetsBuy more VGRO!I mean everyone who visits this sub with any regularity understands the type of posts we get here. Why do we need weekly "no quality posts" posts?yes we are aware but so what? Either contribute or find a sub to your liking?
Fair enough that he wants to voice his opinion but so do I.People pay good money for the newspaper. They have a right to expect quality content.

This is just a free discussion forum.Shh, don't tell him.Bank of Canada printer goes brrrrrtbh there has been an extreme spike in rate my portfolio posts
Look at my post history and you can see the ~12 that I removed today


Also, for the same reason that posts that are just like "Thoughts on AC" are removed.still shouldnt be filled with spam or just super low effort screenshots from your phone in my opinion.... what does Rate my portfolio even mean if you arent talking about your age risk goals income etc etc

It doesnt contribute to any kind of real discussionMake it rain!I always assume those are shit posts - and it's usually pretty obvious if it is (and that's maybe a whole other discussion about automods etc). Wallstreetbets leaking and so forth. I would say don't get too worked up about it because the cream rises to the top. Those "rate my portfolio" posts will get no engagement unless there's something interesting to say. And if it's a shitpost and nobody engages - then the trolls *should* stop over time since nobody here gives an F.

And anyone who comes here frequently has gotten good at skimming over the shit entries, check out what's interesting to them, then move on to something else.Monopoly + practically guaranteed gov supportCNR goes down after earnings like 80% of the time and grinds higher over the next month. I agree this is bullish, but it will prob still dump.Then how about calling back the 1000's of employees you laid off.🍻Haha guaranteed until some protestors want to shut you down over something you aren't involved in!I hope your right, ive been waiting to buy more.Then the poor ceo can't get his million dollar bonus :(Not in Alberta anymore. Legislation banned protesting on critical infrastructure. 

I'll say it sucks to ban protesting but strictly on investing it's a good thing for rail out here.I might get in on some if there's a dump.Oh lovely. I mean yes, feel free to protest in front of the parliament buildings. Blocking highways and railways just fucks over the other little guy who might have been on your side before that.I'm indifferent but recognize it sucks when your community and business relies on shipments. If you're in a smaller community you're fucked. You look at what Churchill Manitoba went through when their rail line was wiped out, they aren't the only town that relies on it.

But I'm just here looking like an investor and knowing rail can't be held up here is nice to know.It's also worth repeating that "the markets are at an all-time high" is the sort of thing that sounds amazing and incredible but in fact is just a simple byproduct of the fact that markets, over time, tend to go up. If you have something that goes up over the long term, of course you're going to have many days when it is "at an all time high", over a period of many many years.i hold nasdaq etf but it hurts to not have got more in during march. i was almost out of cash and thought it'd go lower.Nasdaq100 is a beast long term short term whateverI don't understand how this is possible.The markets will continue to go up as long as bond rates and inflation are under 1%. Nothing else matters long term. Personally, I'll take the contrarian bet since the pay off is so great.I love that list.  The bears on reddit have come up with one excuse after another as to why we're going to test the bottom again - and meanwhile they've missed a whopping 40%+ gain in the process.  How sad.Looking at SP500 level:

2000 dot-com bubble burst --> top to bottom = -49.2% in 30 months

2008 housing bubble burst --> top to bottom = -56.8% in 17 months

2020 corona crash --> top to bottom = -35% in 1 month

How did everyone do today?

Is there a forseeable end to this "bubble" in the midst of a Coronavirus epidemic? 

Did anyone see this coming and do super well? Or did anyone get screwed over by shorting the market?

Discuss.ATH just 4 months into what seems like a long and deep recession coming.

It took 5yrs for the market to recover after 2008.Fair enough. Market timing is tough/impossible, but always obvious in hindsightThere will be some interesting points of volatility these few months, I reckon, as covid waves ebb and flow and the election comes.Run the numbers average out the actual amount of gain over say 10 or 20 or 30 years

You will see it comes out to minuscule fractions of a percent or a tiny amount of money... so you shouldn't feel so bad

Get out of market timing game like me, it's a huge load off your shoulders if you can make money another way (everyone except for day traders leave timing to the pros or the lucky...)Which one is other nasdaq etf  than xqq? Does vanguard have any Canadian currency nasdaq ETF?It's gonna explode somewhere between now and 3 year from now. It's not like the weak real economy isn't gonna wound their revenue at some point.

 The environment has changed but humans haven't.  If we think back to 1917 and the average time for vaccin/vaccination there's perhaps as much as 2 years left of Covid "fear environment", who know's, but people talking about a permanent total shift are hyperoverestimating.Sore losers in bear camp at the moment? True

It doesn’t have to be one true the other false...As sad as those who kept saying Tesla is overpriced these last few months. I mean one can have solid reasoning and be wrong when it comes to predicting the market.FYI I'm bearish priced in gold and silver. I'm actually up 15% in a year vs sp500. The smart bears are winning.

Anyone bearish on stocks priced in USD is in the wrong trade.There is a bit of apples vs oranges here, if I could say so. I would hold that thought on the “2020 corona crash”, we did see a vertical cliff jump, but there is no indicator to say that will be the only one drop. In fact, 30 months and 17 months shows us the worst is yet to come. The cheerleaders on this current market valuation levels are simply concerning.2020 age of institutional algos and bots market movers  , market crashes and recoveries are automated and rapid.Fed is difficult to overcomeI don’t believe this is a bubble, at least not the way we are used to the term “bubble”. Investors are absolutely cornered at the moment. As a result, they put all the chips on this stock market table and so are the dealers (Fed and CBs). 

What many normally would call “bears” at this point are likely not to be the bears that we are used to, either. The market is grossly overpriced and that’s concerning. Forget about bears and bulls, we need a correction. This mostly band-aid economy needs better treatment than just these stimulus programs. And no, vaccine isn’t the only needed to turn this around. In the meantime, if we do have a correction, no one can afford to lose now, not even a bit. Don’t forget, all chips are on the table now and you are looking at them. 

If most of the readers on this sub-reddit actually think the price levels that we are having is cheerful, then I can only wish you all the best for your next 40% gain to come.>Did anyone see this coming and do super well? Or did anyone get screwed over by shorting the market?

I've been ignoring my account for the last couple of months, but logged in today out of curiosity. Saw my portfolio up by 5% today. WTF.Oh it will happen. Just don't know when. Don't fight the Fed.you're right, I just double checked the S&P 500 myself. 1500 in late 2007 and only back to 1500 in about 2012/13. [source for anyone else interested](https://www.macrotrends.net/2488/sp500-10-year-daily-chart)

Do you anticipate a similar major dip (that we won't recover from in half a decade) coming soon?Nasdaq has outperformed other indicies for over a decade nowyo this list is tempting fate wayyy too muchHow is it \_always\_ obvious? People predicted american response, unfettered printing and stimulus, tech dominance, riots, whole industries shuttered, bankrupcy, etc?  


I feel like saying it always is predicted is far different from the reality. I'm a bull but still!VggQQQ is the big daddy, own a lot of it in my RRSP with vgt , fdn  igv  Arkw and wcldIt’s also fair to point out that a pandemic shutdown like this was unprecedented, so people didn’t (and still don’t) really know what to expect because there is no real precedent. 

Tesla, on the other hand, is a textbook case of overvaluation, just like the dot com crash. I have multiple random people on my Facebook who have never shown any indication that they invested or know anything about it who are gushing about Tesla stock daily. It’s a personal anecdote, but it matches online sentiment as well.You still think there'a going to be another major leg down? I can't think of a single catalyst that could bring us to retest March low, except for a nuke being dropped on Sillicon Valley or COVID mutates into a deadlier virus with a death rate >10%.> If most of the readers on this sub-reddit actually think the price levels that we are having is cheerful, then I can only wish you all the best for your next 40% gain to come.

What exactly do you mean by this? It kind of went over my headAnother interesting stat, it took even longer (7yrs) after the dot com bubble for the market to recover..

I personally anticipate some level of market correction or downward trend but I'm no expert and even they have differing opinions on what will happen.  So who knows.  

This level of market intervention, stimulus and QE is unprecedented.   Maybe the market recovery will be too.

Here is a good site for historical statistics 

https://www.macrotrends.net/2577/sp-500-pe-ratio-price-to-earnings-chartRecovery was guided by the fed pumping liquidity into the market purchasing corporate bonds and ETFs . Also interest rates are zero .Because *somebody* predicted correctly, and you focus in on that in hindsight, but if you go back and look at the discourse at the time, there was no consensus.>In hindsightAgree. That’s the thing about Tesla, is it’s now like the 12-15th largest company in America.  

Do you really think that it should be worth as much as the largest media company (Disney or Netflix, take your pick they are similar) AND the largest defence company in Lockheed Martin...you know, the ones who actually have just as impressive engineering (if not more) than Tesla?

Like, even if Tesla were to become everything in their wildest dreams in terms of selling 50% of all cars to Americans, and running a large energy firm, they still probably wouldn’t be the 12th largest company in the USA.  Basically, the current pricing means they will 100% achieve everything they have ever wanted to achieve, and that you are paying full price now for that.Who cares if they are overvalued  savy investors already  took massive profits off Tesla and shop since the March lows  .  Congrats to themInteresting you have 2008 as part of your list. 

This is not as good as nuke and fatal pandemic, but do you qualify this as a trigger?

(PS: we are in a very fragile economy. If you don’t believe the current economy is not strong enough to face this junk mortgage scheme at the moment, then I guess we just have different views here.)Being sarcastic there. 

I believe this sub-r is full of investors. If most of the investors actually find the current market bullish, then market is being very much disengaged from our economic conditions and that disengagement will be restored, whatever it takes. Many keep the score card of 40% up from March low on Nasdaq. The next 40% upside will still come, but that will be in years and years ahead. What I said here may make you think I am bear in the market, but I do believe we have lots of good potential coming in the future years, but we have to fix this current broken economy to move forward better.> This level of market intervention, stimulus and QE is unprecedented.

How long can that go on though?You forgot about the Central Banks there buddy.Gotcha, thanks for the clarification.Forever. At least 3 years. But the question is, does it matter if price of food goes up faster?Forever just means a truly false economy.  
What you don't just grow the food you need?  Move to somewhere where there's more food obviously, someone will buy your house in a non-food region for sure.    It's not like food production and sales are an Oligopoly in Canada.  
Those are the issues we will face if food goes up faster, that would be some very bad news inflation for many Canadians.  

Unrelated note: I work in commercial construction and get stuck in rural towns all the time, a year and a half ago I was on a flight with a guy that owned the two grocery stores in his town of 18,000, his ex-wife ran them both and all he did the whole flight was brag about how much money he made and that he spent 6 months a year on vacation, I guess owning the means of distribution is exceptionally profitable in rural Canada."Among G-7, only Canada and Germany still have S&P’s top rating"This is like telling a drunken sailor that he's good for more beer on ample bladder room bc he just took a piss.Wait wasn't Trudeau going to destroy both the economy and the Canadian society???? Been told that for a while from the turds in /r/canada“We expect the Canadian economy to recover in 2021, which will partially compensate for the loss of output this year, and continued GDP growth thereafter,” S&P analysts said. “This recovery will lead to an improvement in the government’s deficit in 2021.”



Does anyone here expect them to improve the deficit  in 2 years? I don't.Great! Let’s start building renewable energy infrastructure in the prairie provinces!>You've reached your free article limit

...and that's when I left bloomberg.comWhen I read the headline I thought exactly: "Hmm... must be on a relative scale..."Tbh I like beer so let's do it.A country's credit rating is not the same as the economy.!remindme 6 monthsThey are, there are more thanjust one credit rating agency, 3 weeks ago.

"The statement came after Fitch Ratings dropped the country to a “AA+” rating on Wednesday over what it called [“the deterioration of Canada’s public finances”] (https://globalnews.ca/news/7103870/coronavirus-morneau-defends-finances-canada-credit-downgraded/)Don't listen to them.  Half of them are foreign instigators trying to get the gullible bigots to believe immigration is bad.  Basically in order to keep the Canadian economy from growing.  The other half are the knee jerk emotional cripples that fall for it.What returdsImprove it over this year? Yes. Below pre covid levels? Doubtful.Do you know there’s a difference between a deficit and total debt? Because I don’t see how anyone that understands the difference could possibly think that they won’t be able to improve a $343 billion deficit that came about as the result of black swan event. Doesn’t matter how much you hate Trudeau for his ethics violations or whatever else. I’m not a fan either. But the second CERB and the wage subsidy end the deficit is improved by a massive amount. And they aren’t going to continue for another 2 years.You expect CERB to increase payments next year? I don’t think anyone is expecting the deficit to keep increasing.Improve it over this year? Yes. Below pre covid levels? Doubtful.I've always thought that Manitoba would be a good place for some nuclear power plants. Majority of population is in the south, and they have more frigid temperatures up north. They also have a few thousand isolated lakes that could be used for a water supply.I don't know why people hate this idea.

Seriously, the oil and gas sector could go balls deep on clean energy and get massive incentives from the government.

If we have to use oil, it should be our own, but that will eventually be phased out. I don't understand why people refuse to accept this.

If Jason Kenney was smart, he would make a smart ass tweet saying Elon Musk is probably too big of a bitch to give a trillion dollar investment to Canada for renewable energy.  Boom, Canada becomes the largest producer and exporter of renewable energy products.

|-|-|-|-|>to believe immigration is bad

Depends for whom.. if you depend on earning a wage as your main source of income then it's definitely bad for you. If you're an investor or real estate owner then it's definitely great for you.Either that or they’re from Alberta.Government debt in Canada isn't really an issue, the problem is individual debt being enormous.If you think the deficit is still going to be around 343 billion by the end of the year then I have a bridge to sell you. 

"Ethics violations" he tried to funnel almost a billion dollars into a shell company. That's blatant corruption and attempted theft, not an ethics violation. 

It will take us a generation to recover from this government's reckless fiscal management.I think CERB is likely to persist going into 2021 since cases appear to be rising again, signalling the commencement of phase 2 COVID19. Lockdowns and whatever else are coming in late August or September.No I doubt CERB will be around next year. 

I just don't see how were going to fix the deficit when the PMO is funneling a billion  dollars out of Canada's bank into his real estate holding."If Jason Kenney was smart"  I found the problem right there.I don’t think people hate the idea, for one I think that’s a very good idea. Renewable is the future. The problem is this is just gonna pile the debt to a whole new level, which is the centre of this topic here.I hate the idea that in the face of a downgrade by a different credit rating agency, and during a massive recession, people want to spend more money when we never had a surplus since the last 2 recessions ended. 

2007 was the last surplus. What a joke.What I meant was... given the wartime-like deficits we're running, no agency would give us a seal of approval unless our compatriots were doing the same and worse.... And this so called faith is coming from the same institutions that said Lehman Brothers was ok before their demiseThe said ability comes from land, fresh water and a wealth of natural resources of which Canada has plenty. Hence the rating.Agreed, somewhat, regarding the ability to cover the country's obligations.  However, the *inclination* to cover the country's obligations is a political (not economic) issue.  The current government (and many around the world) appear entirely disinclined to address growing deficits and debt.It’s been great for me as a real estate investor, also for my other businesses. For my teenagers trying to find entry level jobs not so much. For my youngest siblings looking to buy a home it’s been terrible.GDP can't increase without population growth.  While delving into the deeper problems of the never ending GDP expansion model is not really a discussion I want to get into at the moment, it can't be denied that population growth is key to increased GDP in most economies.

Edit: No reply and a downvote.  Racists are so pathetic.Not going to fall for that one...Sooo, we should increase taxes??There are a few days of moderate upticks and you're predicting lockdowns in 6 weeks?The correct thing is to save during the good times for the rainy day.
And when the rainy day comes, you open your wallet.

.... Unless you're Albertan, in which case ***YOLO***Got it.  I do believe we are in a better position than some others.I mean... yeah? No question that they aren’t perfect. They’ve been wrong before, they will be again. Point me to a single human institution that is without flaws and has never made a significant mistake. We don’t take what they say as gospel, because we shouldn’t take anything as gospel. But we give them due weight because despite their flaws and mistakes they are basing their ratings on specific, specialized knowledge and decades of data that go far beyond what any one person such as you, or I, could have processed.Yeah, no. It’s considerably more complicated than that. Russia has land, fresh water, and a wealth of natural resources and their ratings are much lower than Canada’s. It’s also about stable institutions, the education of the workforce, historical reliability, and numerous other factors that make the Canadian economy a safe bet.That would be because in the midst of an ongoing crisis is a terrible time to address deficits and debts. Governments closing the purse strings during a crisis invariably deepens the crisis. The deficits of governments around the world this year obviously aren’t sustainable, but they won’t have to be. And debt is significantly more complicated than debt growth=bad. Interest rates, debt to GDP ratios, when the debts mature, etc. all need to be considered when talking about growing debt.Haha “everyone who disagrees with me is racist!”
That’s awesome. Thanks for the laughs friendCanadian taxation is already among the highest, raising taxes among high unemployment rates and weak consumer spending is a suicide mission. The only left is to keep the mint printers hot. We will see how long SP will keep their mind unchanged.Boom times? Tax Cuts for everyone!I agree with most of this but to call what ratings agencies did in 2008 a "mistake" is just flat out wrong.

They knew the products they were "rating" AAA were dog shit.Yeah because that's what this is about.  Don't try to deny it friend.  You know it's true.

BTW, maybe your teenagers are just dumb.  Or see themselves as too good for the jobs everyone else has to do.High income earners typically weathered the pandemic with no loss of employment or income. There is likely room to tax high incomes and the wealthy without damaging the broader economy.Your definition of a mistake is just flat out wrong. You’re conflating a mistake and an accident. An accident happens unintentionally. A mistake can happen with full knowledge by the person making it that what they are doing is wrong. It’s still a mistake. A mistake is something done incorrectly. The intentions of the perpetrator are irrelevant.Immigrant is a race now? Employers for entry level work are hiring adults who are available all the time over youths who have school and extra curricular activities.

It’s a little weird that you’d attempt an insult at someone’s children. Is that how you typically deal with differences of opinion?The government doesn't have a revenue problem, they have a spending problem. 

It doesn't matter what rate they tax rich people at if they're going to spend more then they collect anyways.If we go by English definitions sure.

Again simply to brush off a level of fraud that was part of one of the biggest economic collapses (at the time) as a simple "mistake" rubs me the wrong way. It was intentional. They knew what they were doing and just didn't care.

I'd argue the intentions are relevant, but perhaps were just assigning a different definition to the same word.No it's how I deal with racists.By what metric do you say that its a spending rather than an earning problem?

[Canada's tax revenue as a % of GDP](https://countryeconomy.com/taxes/tax-revenue) is not at at all high compared to the remainder of the G7:

* France: 48.2%

* Italy: 42.4%

* Germany: 41.3%

* United Kingdom: 34.9%

* Canada: 30.8%

* Japan: 30.6%

* United States: 26.0%

Increasing Canada's tax revenue to the same fraction as in the UK would amount to nearly $70 billion of additional earnings each year. That is the more than three times the 2019 deficit. The current round of COVID-19 stimulus could be paid off in roughly 5 years with the additional revenue. Increasing it to Germany's level yields over $170 billion, nearly 10 times the 2019 deficit and paying of the COVID-19 deficit in 2 years.Yes, we are assigning different definitions to the same word. I’m using the actual definition, and you’re using your own made up definition. I didn’t say it was a “simple” mistake, I said it was a mistake. Mistakes can also be colossal in scale. Hitler invading Russia was a mistake that cost millions of lives. So you’re both unilaterally assigning a trait to mistakes (intention) and limiting their scope to only being small, trivial things. If you want to redefine words to whatever you’ve made them into, fine, but I can’t really have a debate with such a person. It’s impossible to properly communicate if we can’t even agree on what words mean.Interesting. My family is Tsimshian, we are against immigration. There has been no consultation about this colonialist action. 
You appear to support immigration, including the current levels? 
Pls I’m curious, how are my family and I racist? Are you white?The governments projected deficit increases 25 billion dollars per month. That’s per month! 

Where the hell do you think we’re going to find over 25 billion dollars a month to combat this? 

May 01, 2020 the years deficit was 252.1 billion, July 7, the deficit is 343 bn, it’s not been almost a month since then so add another 15 bil minimum. 

Maybe the government spending over  $120 million telling people to wash their hands is a problem. Maybe paying 16 people to spend 3.7 million reviewing said ads will be another spending problem.

Maybe the government  literally attempting to siphon 900 million dollars into a shell company to pay his mom for speaking fees is an issue we can address? 

“Increasing Canada's tax revenue to the same fraction as in the UK would amount to nearly $70 billion a year, which is the more than double the 2019 deficit.” 

We spend 25 billion a month and even with the UK’s tax rate they would have collected 70 billion per year. 

That’s 270 billion short buddy. Again we have a spending problem.


This problem is only amplified by the hole the debt the liberals acquired before COVID. That was over 100 billion alone and they've only been here for 4 years.Not trying to redefine the words.

Perhaps it's a regional thing, but for me a mistake is typically describe an accident, where lying and committing fraud wouldn't be.

If I give someone bad advice that at the time I thought was good I'd call it a mistake.

If I lied through my teeth and gave them advice that benefited me while hurting them and I knew that would be the outcome I wouldn't call it a mistake. (even though technically by the definition it is.)

I'll concede and say I misinterpreted what you were trying to say.I don't give a fuck what you are.  Misinformed is misinformed.  What I am is of no concern.

You said your children can't find jobs because of immigration.  Would those immigrants taking their jobs be from Norway then?

Edit:  You don't have to be white to be a racist.  Mind blown yet?I don’t know buds, you made the claim that being against immigration is racist. I’m just trying to understand what you mean by that. 
So you’re white. Not native. Figures that you’d be throwing around terms like racist and making insults. 

You’re the good guy and totally not a racist amrite?This isn't about me buds.  It's about your stupid kids.  And the fact that you're not white, and still a racist.  Amazing.

And if you must know, I'm a Mammoth and I want my land back.  For my stupid kids.Comfirmed, young white guy with self loathing issues spouting off on the internet. Pump the brakes buds, you’re spare partsWrong on that one buddy.  You can have no clue as well you know?  As soon as you realize that, maybe you'll be able to move on.  Until then you'll just be spinning your wheels.Yeah ok racist. Keep fronting whiteyGood come back.Yeah agreed,  it’s retarded af calling people racist as your go to insult. Self awareness isn’t your strong point, you took the bait like a chump. That’ll do donkeyYou sure won that exchange.Who cares. Thoroughly enjoying your emotional comments and chuckling at your wokeness. Keep dancing you muppetSure you are xenophobe.Haha that’s awesome. You forgot a few buzzwords kid. Probably good you don’t blow your stack in one go. At least you’re learning. Good boyYou really have no clue do you?  I didn't think you were that stupid from the first post, but here we are.  From your ignorant initial statement, I assumed you were white.  Thanks for reminding me on the fact that there are ignorant, moronic fucks of all races, creeds and cultures.That’s better my little marionette. Dance for meTHIS is EXACTLY how you know you are in a bubble.

in 1999: "Look John! Amazon.com is trading at xyz valuation!  it's an InTeRnEt CoMpAnY, pets.com will for sure go up too!!"Got 2080 shares of MTRX.V @ 0.14 and feel like I'm sitting on a lottery ticket.Solid DDFeel like putting in money I’m ok with lossing like $1000-1500 if the stock jumps 20-30% hell ya cash out be happy if it drops a bunch oh well I triedAlso very interested, so many companies are in the race for the vaccine. Would be interesting to know what Canadian companies are worth investing intoAZN is my personal pick.
Really hyped for their phase 1-data coming out Monday.I personally like VXRT as it has traded higher before so we know that it has potential to go that high again. Might buy Monday morningThey have revenue of 0.5 million and net income of negative 27 million. AwesomeGreat post thanks.And as soon as ome of them finishes first, the rest will crumble, straight gamble play.They haven't even started their Phase 1 yet. There is no hurry. 

https://www.imv-inc.com/product-pipeline/dpx-covid-19No mention of novax? NVAX.SONA has been mentioned in other threads with regard to Covid testing technology. They’re up like 6,000% but apparently there’s still a large upside.Some of the reasonings in this thread are a bit sketchy but I'm sure you'll end up making more money than people who actually spend time looking at balance sheets and such. The market is weird.The only healthcare exposure I have is Northwest Healthcare Properties. The REIT will benifit a little but not as much as companies developing vaccines. I'm thinking of buying a healthcare ETFIPA.VGlad I gave up on iBio on Friday and sold for 3.50... ugh, hind sight.Hope you bought some Friday lolAny more news on this?Can I buy share on weekend?Yea but look at petco, where the pets go>MTRX.V

how do you guys pick up such information and from  where? do you guys get visions or something ?congratsYou're up 100% you've already hit a small lottery.What broker did you buy it on?What happened this stock is moving today 🤣🤣🤣There's so many less sexy stocks that have a better chance for that kind of bounce though. A lot of Canadian REITs for example are still trading at deep pandemic discounts despite the economy opening up. They might bounce with vaccine news, and still are worth something if the pharma company you were targeting flopsThis is my mentality but I’m always hesitant to pull the trigger, in fall 2018 I was going to buy aurora at 1.50$ a pop, 3 months later it was trading over 20$

How do you guys not treat buying stocks like gambling? cause hats exactly how it feels to me.weed stocks no longer in favour, insert "the all new, supa delicious, vaccine stocks!"I bought a sizable amount on Friday, fingers crossed for some good results later on today, for the SP and current covid situation.I would recommend TNXP it has just started flying and last month It was $1.98. So, it may go up to that same number again.Save yr money with NVAX, every new vaccine they start, ends the same way, starts strong, flops out and than they falter for a year, r/s, than repeatI wonder what vaccine companies are in a ETF.  Any recommended info to research a healthcare etf in Canada?I'm down so much on IPA. I can't believe they had a huge dump after their most recent (good) news.It exploded Monday though 🤷🏻‍♂️To die...This, in the beginning it was so hard finding companies that were actually conducting Covid-19 Vaccines as the ones I came across were private with no public trading.Like 400 bucks. Incredibly small lottery.What’s a few good examples of cheap Canadian REITS ?

I was looking at adding a REIT or two.I think that’s a good idea I never thought of REITs but after doing some research there’s defiantly quite a few that are under valuedSome stocks are a gamble regardless of research you do, in a fairly new investor but when I look at company’s I go through financials look at what they sell and look at what’s happening in the world, is what there doing going to last or is it a dieing industry. If you do your research right then it’s less of a gamble and more of educated investment that you have faith will pay offAlso never hold onto those “what if” moments I have been doing that with Tesla and it kills me. You just got to look at every investment differently and never say “oh this could happen to this stock”Why do you recommend them?Interesting, will add TNX to watcherSold warrants. Paying off debt. It's just a small dent, good long term hold.Yea, my post was complete sarcasm... So typical that it pops right after I decide I'm done.. best I can feel is that I moved to something a bit more comfortable... Though I definitely tempted to buy back in due to fomo, hahacool thanksBut a lottery nonethelessThere's tons, you have to do your research because owning a REIT that owns warehouses is different from one that owns condos, vs one that owns everything 

Two I've been getting into are Brookfield Property Partners and H&R Block REIT. Both have a lot of a commercial real estate exposure, which the market has heavily discounted in the context of COVID, but IMO has really overshot. H&R for example is trading at about 50% of its pre-COVID price, was still successfully collecting 80% of its rent cheques in May (last quarterly report), and has a NAV of $22 per share (net worth of their assets at today's real estate prices) while they trade at $10. 

Even if it takes another year of this I think the REITs will rebound with some patience.  Going into an economic downturn it makes sense to discount real estate, but I dont think a 50-60% discount is justifiedI'm not Canadian, but even I am investing in the Canadian REITS, the dividends look good and stable, as other said 40-50%+ off, trading way under value. I also like how they're paying per month, a lot better than what's on offer in Australia. I have invested in,   


1. TNT - 70% rent collected is from government tenants
2. RioCan - Large and diversifying into residential/mixed-use properties, last report said they didn't have much issue collecting rents.
3. H&R - Dividend was cut by 50%, they devalued their property recently by $1.3b - hence big loss reported for last quarter, but they still collected most rent and have high quality assets.
4. SmartCenters - This is my smallest holding, they're retail centers, so getting hammered, but most of their centers are anchored by Walmart.

It will be very interesting to see what Q2 results are like with regards to rent collection.  


I'm also looking at Slate (SRT-UN.TO), Canadian ran, but operates in the US, high dividends, good rent collections rented in June that 90% rent was collected for June.

|-|-|-|-|Alt-right joke attempt maybe?Oh its not in order hahaha. My fav is canadian couch potatoI like how every episode seems to have a purpose. Bad investment advice and ask the spud are great segments too. Hope he comes out of podcast retirementI know they were having issues on Google Play and I'm not sure about Apple, but they are on Spotify. Here's the link: https://open.spotify.com/show/78QVzRYJmLvadYIZQNTqUe?si=79PQryP-TmCkOGySWuCSEQJust WSBMuh alt-right boogeymen.Just degeneratesThanks!Ya they're the worstYep. They could be lurking around every corner.

Better stay safe.Every cuck joke a potential threatThe potential for your feelings to be hurt is endless.I see BCE and Rogers going down a bit more since their media operations were affected quite a bit. Telus might do better since they utilized their health division quite a bit during the pandemic and sub growth was faster than others.Shaw had their earnings and their share prices just went up. I don't  see any changes for the big 3.Lol who else are they going to go for internet access. I doubt anyone can remain sane without broadband access. 

Don’t think will change muchthe equity analysts are giving the big providers a nudge by positioning them as victims in the pandemic to desperately find a narrative which would shake off federal regulators. There are multiple lines of competition regulation in the work: confirming lower wholesale wireline prices, possibly mandated wholesale access to the wireless networks as well as complaints at the competition bureau. Right now oligopic incumbancy obviously looks better for FCF and ARPU in general, but I feel the opportunity of the increased usage with more valuable offerings will offset the difference.

oh and covid likely was a net good for network providers without too much exposure to the media sectorI know there is a lot of hate towards the big 3 but, from an investment perspective, I actually really like them.  I'm really looking forward to 5G and how this could translate into growth and profit for each of the three.Good. I hope starlink makes RoBellUs go bankrupt[deleted]v good buy more telusWait, who would have thought?They jacked up prices on internet at home because of this.  Mine doubled with Rogers last month and I can't do anything about it.  They will always find a way to get us.  Now we have to work from home so they will charge us more for the same exact service.Disgusting twisted lot. They should all fuck themselves and stop price gouging canadians.I think imma sell out of rogers before wedCogeco Communications provides internet, telephone and TV in Canada and US  (not Cogeco Inc) is a much better company than Rogers, BCE & Telus at a much better valuation.So Telus not going on sale? 
It would be my preference because of the health angle.I live in north central British Columbia, in a small town. Telus has had a virtual monopoly here. They only supply DSL (15 Mbps max) in town. 

If you live out of town like me, you're SOL. I'm even out of range of one of the only cell towers too. Thanks to a small local ISP, I have high speed wireless internet. Shoutout to *Evolve Communications*.

Robellus can get fucked. Fingers crossed for Starlink.but what are the odds CRTC allows them in or allows them access to cities and not just rural areasIs really better if a US company takes all of our telecom business?Starlink is planning to put 60,000 satellites around the Earth. This is a horrible plan, it’s going to fuck with the night sky and animal migration. I to hate RoBellUs, but let’s not think Starlink is going to wipe them out.>If any telecommunications company wants to survive in the future they need to provide a reasonably priced internet tv bundle for less than $100 a month.

I'm sure there's lots of money to be made on those that are predicting the demise of a government enforced telecommunications duopoly.Lol dont let this article fool you. Check SJR earningsIt’s already down 14% from its ATH. Last week would’ve been the perfect time to buy when it was at 22.30Yet they all claim that the reason that cell phone service prices in Canada are amongst the highest in the world is because they need to use so many resources to connect all the rural communities in Canada. Pathetic excuse, and we're all pathetic for believing them and continuing to pay.But on the flip side.... Low housing costs right?Interesting take. How high up are these migrating  birds flying?SpaceX is launching 1,584 satellites. Get your facts straight before you try to shit on something.Yeah and fuck vaccines too amirite?I dont see much hope in Corus unfortunatelyGot in at 22.33 :)Good point. I guess my $3,000 dollar rent for a 800ft two bedroom downtown Toronto doesn’t seem as bad now knowing I have 1.5gb Bell internetHave fun with your 1000ms delay with Starlink lolHow stupid are you? That is just the latest batch. The finished starlink project will be 60k satellites.5G causes corona, wake up sheepleWhat the hell is the correlation between Corus and Rogers?22.40$ hereLol anyone with Telesat can agree to that especially when the weather is bad.That's literally not true. Starlink satellites are far closer to Earth, so it nearly matches fibre optic for latency. 

https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/03/musk-says-starlink-isnt-for-big-cities-wont-be-huge-threat-to-telcos/Oh you meant Sjr. I read it as cjr[removed]> Starlink satellites are far closer to Earth, so it nearly matches fibre optic for latency. 

that's literally and physically untrue. No satellite system is going to match fibre optic cables for latency. It is physically impossible and your article does not claim otherwise.Your account is not old enough

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/CanadianInvestor) if you have any questions or concerns.*I said it *nearly* matches - and when you're talking about a 15ms difference vs a 1000ms difference, it does. You're also assuming that the tech is anything like how current satellite internet is. Geostationary orbit is *really fucking* far away which is the entire culprit for the latency. Starlink doesn't have that issue.

I linked that half-baked article because nothing explained it properly other than ~15 minute YouTube videos, but if you're actually interested, you can skip to 4:20 here:

https://youtu.be/giQ8xEWjnBsi've worked with satellite internet systems before and the speed of light (i.e. distance to satellite) is only one component of latency. Signal to noise ratio is another major factor. Elon's proclamations tend to be only loosely based in reality and engineering.

Latency to geostationary satellites in the order of several thousand milliseconds are common and only get worse in bad weather. Even if you reduce the distance to the satellite, these "theoretical" maximum speeds are best-case scenarios and will not be consistent. A 

So no, any satellite-based internet system is absolutely not going to be comparable in performance or latency to a fibre-optic system. Saying "nearly matches" is like saying that you have access to electricity for 5 minutes a year so your house is "connected to the grid".

Edit - in the absence of concrete data or a working prototype, everything that starlink says is marketing speak. I've watched that video before and it glosses over a lot of the challenges while focusing on the best-case scenario.Fair enough. I initially said "nearly matches" since *theoretically* it's best case scenario is faster than a fibre line over cross-continental distances, but of course it would be wildly more inconsistent. I'm not one to praise daddy Elon, so I doubt what his average speeds can be in practice, but the point I tried to make in the beginning is simply that we're dealing with a ballpark of dozens of milliseconds of extra latency, not thousands.this exactly is the danger of people like Elon. Many of his ideas are downright fantasy and are not based in solid engineering. Starlink is a great concept and i wish him all success but to compare any form of satellite internet to even cable broadband is simply disingenuous.

Even the ballpark estimate of latency is misleading as it is comparing a best-case scenario to what something like fibre can deliver consistently.\+1 for TEC.TOI like TEC since it includes fintech companies like MasterCard and Visa whereas ZQQ is just the Nasdaq 100.Price per share is meaningless but yeah go with the cheaper option with less concentration in the huge names/r/JustBuyTEC/Tech is in such a bubble right now .. everything is at or heading back to ATH

I want an all in one tech ETF as well but damm.. buying at these prices ?You could look at [TXF.TO](https://TXF.TO).    
Hold 30 top tech names (not just info-tech) with a covered call overlay.   
Pays a great dividend (7%) and the CC overlay tamps down volatility.Have you looked into the prospectuses for both ETFs? I'm not too sure about ZQQ but TEC has a MER of about 0.35% and has exposure to V and MA which should both go up over time due to cashless transactions. 

My advice would be to look at the prospectuses and see the top 5-10 holdings for each and ask yourself if you are comfortable with its holdings and allocations.TEC all the way to the moonI'm all about tecI'll just leave this quote here from Warren Buffet: " Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful."

Just make sure you remember to set a stop limit.Tech is the boss the long-term usd  tech ETFs are even better . Look into Vgt , igv , Arkw , WCLD , fdnHow does everyone feel about EARK.TO?ZQQ/XQQ are both great if you want a well diversified index that mainly covers the Nasdaq and a lot of tech with some other industries. TEC is great if you want a pure tech play with some more risk. You could probably go 80/20 if you want to reduce risk a bit, but I don't think you can really go wrong.If NASDAQ 100 is your thing and you’re the type to chase the lowest MER, the look into QQC.F by Invesco: 0.25 MER. 

If you want the best unhedged NASDAQ 100 returns, HXQ is your ETF. MER if 0.28.TEC and XIT for me. Both down big todayTECI’m super hot on ZQQ. Most of the nasdaq 100 is tech anywayI like TXF for my TFSA as it generates income with the covered call premiums and still has some upside opportunity. I think from a raw gains perspective [tec.to](https://tec.to) has brighter prospects.Txf.to but its pretty darn high right now... but the divvy is amazing!TEC.TOTEC. But only because that’s the one I own.Tec.toI have QQC.F which is like ZQQ only because I bought before TEC was available and I also hold MA and V shares which is one of the biggest differences between TEC and NASDAQ 100.  Performance over the last 6 months is similar as MA and V only make up less than 5% of TEC holdings with the rest being pretty much the same for the top 10TEC.TO or VFVHxq is the best one yetI won't touch anything from BMO. Internally, I find their paperwork very sloppy and that runs across all departments.Xqq xitXQQ[deleted][deleted]The millennials are showing their true colours in this sub. 

Vgro > TecEnough with the Tec questions people. 

USE THE SEARCH BARDamn it’s got some yummy dividend yieldsWhat was the reasoning why fintech isn't included in NASDAQ?Clicked on this.... thought it was a fake link... actually exists...It's a safe haven for people at want to invest money at low interest rates, people trust companies like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google to not drop drastically compared to companies in other sectors.You could always buy some now and then more later...

I don't have any dry powder (and won't really, until probably the end of the year) but I would start a position in TEC today if I did.Nice one! But damn is the CI website terrible for ETFs compared to iShares, BMO or Horizon.Covered call also limits upsideReal men don't put stops in.I agree.  TAN  ARKW and ZQQ.If you want to get Ark Invest ETF, get ARKK.

Their Canadian equivalent (EARK) MER is way too high.Since March 30th ZQQ has outperformed TEC. 
ZQQ is up 36.82% 
TEC is up 32.17%

I agree both are great.  I like the diversification of ZQQ while still having over 50% in tech.QQC.F is the equivalent of ZQQ but with lower MERCovered call ETF in Tech sector when it is booming, nice suggestion!!!Do these types of inverse ETFs suffer from decay? e.g. TVIX, HSD, SQQQ etc. Or do they have to be 2x to accelerate it?HXQ simply follows the NASDAQ 100. Perfect if you like investing in a variety of companies and fields from high tech to cookie makers (Mondelez), hotels (Marriott) or soft drinks companies (Pepsi)....I prefer HQD nowIsn't XIT Canadian tech companies? So overwhelmingly full of Constellation Software and Shopify?I'm curious why that matters? The expense ratio is taking from the growth while the dividend is paid out. They are unrelated.Is this a joke?The question is what is the best tech ETF in Canada. Not, what is the best asset allocation ETF in Canada.good tech companies wont have yieldyeah you get tech for growth not dividends. the growth is 20%+ in my case. there is nothing with dividend yield of 20% lol. it's just unrealized gain though.Does it tho? I cannot find any history on dividend distributions?I bought some more at the dip near end of the day. Didn't think TEC would be going lower again, had to buy on the dip.Because they aren't listed on the NASDAQ but the NYSE.Theres literately a sub for everything bruhI still am amazed quite a few people know of tec. On other invesring forums out there, nobody ever talks about TD etfsExactly. People ask me what a safe stock is. I say "Apple." Every time. And have for years. They're the only stock I don't really sell. They're like a very productive bank but with better management.Yes, potentially.  
It’s a trade between income and lower volatility vs max upside.  
For me, I like the incomeDoesn’t holding US etfs complicate things with taxes?Depends how big you portfolio is. The MER is 1% more than ARKK. If you believe the 1% is worth doing norbert's gambit then go ahead.TLF also with covered callYa like most their holdings are tech tho, but ur getting the diversification.Exactly, and so few companies in total that blackberry is the 7th largest holdingXIT is just an easier way to buy SHOP, IMO.And CGILol shit my badDefiantly, just sold shares in a company I didn’t feel to good about to start as I was mainly looking for dividend stocks to start my portfolio, this had none but after 8 months (bought pre corona) it’s bounced back and netted me a healthy 50% profitI was being sarcastic it’s 0.33% yearly yield lol can get better returns from a savings account but I’m not buying it for dividendsIs it really much of a dip considering it closed at an all time high yesterday?Most forums tend to be american dominated, eg:Spy , voo, vtsax etc. Canadian etfs are barely talked about at allthis subreddit is dominated by tec and vgro recommendationsBuffett himself said it's the best business he knows.

But if you are looking for a 100% tech ETF, NASDAQ 100 is not the optimal solution.Forgot about that company 😬Yeah so OP should ask themself if they would buy SHOP/CSU at their current prices to determine if they want to buy XIT at this level.Buying shop is the easiest way to own shopI don't think anyone buys it for dividend. The yield is just enough to cover MER while you watch it grow O.OWelp, considering I didn't think it would go down as it did today, I think getting more shares at the low point of the day is buying at the dip no?I thought the irs takes a withholding tax on dividends in a tfsa. Is this taken directly off the dividend payout or will it have to be settled when you do your taxes?👌Agreed.Arkw returned 70 percent ytd even it had a dividend which I believe it doesn't who cares about a paltry 15 percent tax lolThe withholding tax on dividends on the tfsa is insignificant when you're getting so much growth anyways.It's taken directly off of the dividend.It's on the dividend and done automatically. But you won't get much dividend with ARK because tech companies typically don't pay dividends so nothing to worry about.Ya I’m not worried about the dividend gains. Was more about the tax complications but you cleared it up, thanks.Yeah for tech don't be.

For RRSP it's actually better to hold US ETFs for dividends because a RRSP is exempt of that withholding tax. So a US ETF paying dividends wouldn't get taxed. But a Canadian ETF is the holder of the US security so it's taxed when the company pays a dividend to the ETF, before it gets to you no matter the account. The difference is pretty small but still.Algonquin Power is one of my favourite stocks I hold. Steady growth and I can always rely on it. They’re committed to growing their dividend year over year, so that’s just an added bonus. Great diversification too.RNW?Northland power has been my best stock. It just keeps going up.I was looking at all these last night. Northland and BEP have had huge runups in the past week. BEP doing a stock split at end of month, too. They would be my choice just for name association otherwise.

I couldnt come to a decision about the best choice for value/growth.I have some Innergex, Boralex, and Algonquin (all dividend-paying), along with some Greenlane Renewables. Also, Pyrogenesis, another Canadian stock is going to partner with HPQ Silicon, which looks promising, and both are affordable Canadian Stocks.AQN, BEP, BLX, RNW, NPI, FTSCSIQNot necessarily a specific stock, but there is an ETF ICLN that you can take a look at. It’s a thematic ETF target emerging energy sector. Or you can target a good operator like Brookfield Renewable.

This is just my opinion, but I believe some of these names are very overbought. AQN is a bit special because of their recent equity financing. But if you look at Brookfield Renewable, boy oh boy that’s a big rally coming back from March. I think many investors are betting on a weak oil sector, big government push on infrastructure etc. And I have good reasons to believe that stream of thinking is a little ahead of schedule. So be careful with the hot names.PIFSome of the renewable companies like BEP and AQN can also be found in the XUT ETF. I've been keeping my eye on that but the runups from recent renewables has shot up the price of the ETF.Thoughts on ensign energy?Anyone else get push notifications from google for articles about COVID and CERB but they're actually just pushing people to buy these stocks? It's so weird.BEPBLX & NPI seem to be good options. That being said they're at or close to ATH.Suncor after Q3 dip? Yes Q3. Between Q2-3, I anticipate hype and dropSona NanotechAmen!If you are looking for energy sector stock with year over year dividend increase try ATCO...it is the longest stretch of increase in Canadian history as far as I can tell.Good (monthly) dividend too. Seems like a really solid company, always beats earnings, offers a good combinations of steady/increasing yield while growing relatively rapidly. Lower beta than MSFT too!

TD recently raised their price target to $39.

Also checkout XBC for a fast growing small cap.Could someone explain to me as a individual holding BEP.UN in my TFSA should I sell BEP.UN and buy BEP.C instead?Thanks for the tip on Greenlane. I will have a look!I agree with Greenlane having alot of potential and they seem to be getting lots of contracts lately. But where does it say that they will be working with Pyrogenesis?I was looking at Pyro but man if they don't get that steel contract I'm gonna be awfully sad buying in now.Broad utility ETFs also contain a large number of non-renewable utilities are well. For example, [XUT has a carbon footprint of over 2200 tonnes per $1m of revenue.](https://www.msci.com/esg-fund-ratings/funds/ishares-s-p/tsx-capped-utilities-index-etf/68093305) Compare this with a renewable utility ETF like [YLCO whose footprint is just under 1200 tonnes.](https://www.msci.com/esg-fund-ratings/funds/global-x-yieldco-renewable-energy-income-etf/40211939)

XUT is fine if you want some exposure to renewable utilities, but on balance it seems more heavily weighted towards carbon intensive ones. Unfortunately it is the probably the best one can do for a Canada-listed ETF.Your account is not old enough

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/CanadianInvestor) if you have any questions or concerns.*Just bought some todayI bought in at 26$ when the div yield was better. Plan on selling when it hits 40$Don’t sell, you should be receiving 1 share of the new BEPC for every 4 BEP and any remainders (lacking a multiple of 4) as cash.Won't make a difference to you holding in a TFSA. The reason for the split is to give investors the option of investing in a partnership (BEP.UN) or a corporation (BEP.C). The distinction will only make a difference if you are holding it in a taxable account or if you are a non-resident. Brookfield has said the amount of distributions will be the same value wise based on your holdingsJust based on the bip.un vs bipc situation, I’d be selling bep.un for bepc. Seems like these would trade at a premium compared to the bip/bepSorry, I’m drunk. Edited above.I bought in at $1.75 so I’m happy :)Who needs gold when you have condos and oil?Canada first to adopt bitcoin.What do we need gold for?good thing i got some lolllllSold it all to China.whats the point? They do currency hedgingThey’ve been selling it off to diversify their portfolio for years.  Gold isn’t a great investment long term.  This is nothing more then scare tactics.Why the fuck would they? Do you lack even the basic understandings of national finance? 

Look, I'm a banger for Canadian gold miners, I like them a lot. It's a profitable place to be. I've made more money from Canadian miners than any hack around here who says "buy Rio, Brookfield, and the banks! Can't lose!" 

But it's the fucking bank of Canada. They don't need to own gold, because they represent the entire economy of Canada. A place where everyone wants to live, with clean air, good water, solid universities, and safe basically everything. Canada is a solid country, and a good place to live.

 You know where the gold is for our national bank? IN FUCKING CANADA. If we need gold, we'll mine it. If we need more gold, we'll fucking mine more. We as a country probably have more convertible gold reserves than anywhere else in the world per capita. Maybe even total.

0% worried. We're fine. We can feed ourselves, power our economy with domestic oil, and produce all of the precious metals the world needs. Canada is fine.Do we not have tons of gold still in the ground here though? Was kind of concerned at first, but remembered that lol.Who needs gold when you have maple syrup?Probably offered it to China in return for buying up more Vancouver/Toronto condos   


/s* Countries with ZERO reserves: **Canada**, Kenya, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Central African Republic, Cameroon, Azerbajian, Armenia [Link: Gold Reserves by Countries](https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/gold-reserves)

* BoC is overweight on USD and zero gold. [Link: Canada's international reserves balance as of yesterday](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/related/international-reserves/)

* USD may lose a few more cents against Loonie but I dont think Loonie has much upper hand against G7 currencies unless oil price goes back to the good old days. 

* This isnt particularly bad. Perhaps this is the brilliant currency engineering of Mark Carney (BoC: 2008-2013) to keep the Loonie down without manipulation. 

> Just saying with tin foil hat on. have a good weekend yall.FThey are loaded up on Bitcoin so we will be fine. /sdo you really think most the gold reserves are actually gold?

I'd bet a good portion has been faked.Who the F needs gold?>Total holdings in 2015 amounted to approximately 6,350 tons of gold. Relatively little of this gold belongs to the United States Government; as of August 2016, the building's vault holds 13.4 million troy ounces (460 short tons) of gold bullion and $3 million (book value) in gold coins for the United States

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_New_York_BuildingThis will prove to be a massive mistake. They sold it on the eve of the massive increase in gold prices in the early 2000s.

Oh well, at least I have net CAD liabilities.This is interesting considering how much gold Canada mines each year you would think we would have some as we can buy local and have real gold in place. I guess they figure we don’t need gold...Glad to see gold is absolutely useless. Also it’s being polluted by Chinese counterfeit gold.[removed]Well.

The International Reserves balance you’re referring to is primarily made up of the Exchange Fund Account, which is actually the GoC’s. The EFA is managed by the BoC, but is not part of its Balance Sheet.Except they aren't.

Saying "Money is good, nothing else" didn't only that he only saw hold as a worthy currency. It implies that he didn't see currency as all that special "it's just gold".Lol I never said that but ok.

If government continues printing money, dollar is gonna start losing its value.Why does it even have a price then.
 For everyone in this thread saying there is no point to gold. It's been the monetary base layer for most of history. These past 50 years since getting off the gold standard in 77 have been an anomaly. It is still the unofficial monetary base layer to go to as a hedge against radical monetary inflation, ie money printing to bail out unfunded liabilities. It's a useful form of money, as it cannot be created at will beyond 2% a year. if America decides to print the 56 trillion dollars it needs to pay for the retirement of its baby boomers over the next 2 decades, you would be wise to have owned gold instead of dollars, cad or other Fiat monies.No it wasn'tYes, but the difference is an individual is responsible for locking in losses by selling. The gov't forced this loss on the tax payers.  

I loved it, I got cheaper gold because of it, but as a tax payer I'm pissed. It's simple contrarian investing, everyone hated gold in 2000.Hows gold not a good long term investment? Its up nearly a 1000% from the early 2000s. It has outperformed every other US index (sp500, russel, DJI), besides the bubble Nasdaq.

Oh I see your pathectic personal attack, not only retarded, but childish too!That article is for individual investers... We're talking about a central bank here.Stocks are also a hedge against inflation but they also bring in wealth[Not True](https://rationalreminder.ca/blog/2019/8/30/will-gold-save-the-day)Someone else posted this [article](https://rationalreminder.ca/blog/2019/8/30/will-gold-save-the-day).  It's an excellent article.  I know your arguments are often repeated and well understood to be true but in reality gold has none of the advantages you listed.  As I said, the article is really good and cites many academic papers.

I would also like to point out that you can print gold, they're called promissory notes.  If bitcoin ever makes it big, they'll be promissory notes on those too.

As for the US printing money?  Well understand that's fine too.  The US dollar is perpetually under a short squeeze because it's standard currency for international trade.  It's important to remember that the US government doesn't actually need anyone to fund its operations, it can always print money.  It imposes taxes mainly to make sure there is a viable market for the US$.

This can of course lead to inflation but this is a big subject and not really worth it here but the point is really this has no real impact on gold either, gold is worth whatever the next person is willing to buy for it.You’re still suggesting the government can time the market, they can’t.You called me a retard because I have a different opinion then you so don’t get triggered when it comes back to you.  

Take gold prices back from as far in time as you can and then factor in inflation. It’s been a lousy investment.  I’m done with this.Not only is this article really well done and correct.  It's also fun to see how many people think gold is an hedge because you can't print more of it.

You can print more of it... they're called promissory notes.  Banks had more than 15x their gold holding circulating in notes before fiat.  

If something like bitcoin ever makes it big, banks will start circulating promissory notes for those too no problem too.your article link just goes to a list of countries showing the reserves of gold held for each. not very informative. *inflation expectations* clearly have an effect on golds price in today's environment.Actually what I'm suggesting is to never sell gold because it's money and money is always useful. Until you need it for a war, or a drought, etc you should have money. 

Fair, for every trade there is a seller and buyer. For me to buy at record low prices, someone had to sell. But the reason why Gov't sold gold was stupid. They didn't need it for an emergency.  

I would understand if Canada sold it in the 1990's because we had a debt crisis then. 

Also, when a commodity sells for below the price to mine it, Ya you can time the market. Just like with Oil at -$40 a barrel. The issue is storing the commodity, which you couldn't do for oil. You can do for gold. Warren Buffett did the same for silver when it was below production costs in the late 90s.Oops, fixed the link.

> *inflation expectations* clearly have an effect on golds price in today's environment. 

Should definitely read the article thenRecord low? Not historically but maybe given a narrow timeframe.  

They’re selling off gold reserves and have been for a long time because it isn’t as liquid as other assets in financial markets.  

Finding a buyer for 500 Tons of physical gold is a lot harder then say selling US treasury notes.I would love to see a long dated chart of Canada's reserves. If it was a strategy that started in the early 90's, then I understand, it takes time to sell it all.[Gold Reserves]looks like it began in 2000 (https://tradingeconomics.com/canada/gold-reserves)It's pretty crazy how quiet this subreddit is on gold/silver producers.Not super surprised,  silver was so undervalued,  I quietly started a position in Gold and silver as a hedge in March and I am very happy with the results.Up 10% in a week after reading a zero hedge article last week.

Where are people placing their money to maintain value? Commodities?Don’t believe the silver hype.  There are so many articles out there (a lot by precious metals dealers)about  how it’s going to go extinct, or how demand is up.  Silver is not rare at all, its mainly a by product - free money for miners - so that argument about it needs to be a certain price or the miners can’t mine it is a lie. 27k tons taken out of the ground last year.  Miners make a profit, then the mints make a profit, then the dealers make a profit.  If you buy physical You’re paying a premium, then if you want to sell you’re getting less than spot.  You need at least a 20% gain in a short amount of time (to beat the yearly inflation)   Spot price now is basically where is was 10
Years ago but worth less because of inflation.  There is enough silver just in American eagles and Canadian maples to meet the industrial demand for the next 20 - 30 years.  Gold IS actually rare and what the miners are going after.  Silver is not a good investment.  Some collector coins could be.  You could probably make money buying silver stocks but I would stay away from physical.   There are a lot of arguments against silver that the stackers refuse to listen to.Probably because a) they're not as sexy as tech or the latest fad stock and b) Gold/silver producers (and the general industry) is relatively more complex to understand compared to other industries.It's hilarious. Gold/silver miners are up just as much as Tech, but we have endless amounts of Tech posts and people wanting TSLA/AMZN despite calls for a bubble, and both Gold/Silver are below their highs after the Fed printed $3T this year.  

Imagine the moves when the smart money sells to the dumb money!I posted about silver/gold on here earlier and got berated and downvoted instantly. Tough crowd.

Drone Delivery is subject to gov't regulations, technical limitations and lack of scale (at the moment).  They are still literally in the trial and error stage for a new industry that hasn't yet materialized.  I don't know if they have any patents either.  

I do think it's a long hold and I do believe they will be bought out.  2500 lbs payload would be a huge deal.Certainly does look promising...seems that the March 2020 quarter is the first one with actual revenues?!

More clarity around government regulations, local by-laws, and insurance would be helpful, particularly when these things are zooming around residential neighbourhoods...ive met the CEO he lives the city next over. big prickDrone Delivery would require lots of licensing, pre-testing, and proof of assurance. 

In my opinion it seems as it could go 1 of 2 two ways as anything could.

The company issuing these drones specified for an air-based delivery service are going to explode as a result of not only automation but cost-effectiveness.

Is a drone cheaper than a vehicle designated for delivery? Possibly.

How does insurance go for such vehicles?

Is this drone automated? If so, how about conceiving air traffic? Other air-based vehicles? Other animals, tall objects, of course AI in the grand scheme of things, you’d hope such issues are already taken care of.

How about distance and duration of flights? Can a drone be prepared to travel several dozen kilometres / miles?

How about if the drone gets damaged in the process of delivery.

If automated, what if one gets injured as a result of the drone in anyway shape or form? Whom is held liable and responsible? The government for allowing such activity? the insurance? The manufacturer? Or the company delivering? 

I personally hold a belief that drones could eliminate tons of jobs thanks to automation which is destined for the future; which would lead me to believe that Drone based delivery could either succeed now, or simply fail now. Do some research, expand some thinking about the company starting such projects, email them and ask questions, I’m not an investor; although this does seem like a good company for me to possibly get lookin into!

Remember automation is destined for the future and eliminates jobs as we speak; they wouldn’t have to pay a destined courier to go drive this from A to B rather charge up a drone with a large battery; ensure it was programmed well let it work by itself.this is not coming to market any time soon.  it's last mile delivery so they will be battling companies with the backing of silicon valley venture capital firms.[deleted]They do have 2 patents, which is why I bought some."Drone" by definition is "automated". Also, UAV (unmanned autonomous vehicle)Big pump & dump potential right here, be careful y'all!What are they for?Agreed. Interesting tech and could pave the way in addressing some of the needs of remote communities; However, just as cold weather will kill batteries, I think profits  may be dampened by the cost of the supporting infrastructure (generators, fuel, etc etc) vs. what these communities are willing to pay... [https://dronedeliverycanada.com/resources/drone-delivery-canada-awarded-its-second-us-patent-for-its-proprietary-drone-delivery-technology/](https://dronedeliverycanada.com/resources/drone-delivery-canada-awarded-its-second-us-patent-for-its-proprietary-drone-delivery-technology/) 

Straight from the source.Bought this 2 or 3 years ago. Been a waste of time.Cold weather kills lead acid batteries, not lithium based batteries. They create their own heat.Lithium-ion batteries do not lose as much as lead-acid batteries but they still lose output. Further compounding the issue, charging lithium batteries in cold weather damages them. To minimize this, you have to slow down the rate of charge as it is directly correlated to a process called lithium plating...

I am not stating this is a bad buy, but further DD is required.That's right, however the battery in a drone would never be charged in cold weather as it would be charged at home port.
I am not saying this is a good buy, was just trying to clarify what seemed to be a misconception.You guys need to do some dd. Their bigger drones are gas powered.

Those are what will be massive for moving frate from warehouse to warehouse during a fedex delivery operation.

 They have a central hub that distributes frate to small hubs, who then distribute it amongst delivery drivers.

I use to work for Fedex. A drone would  not have to wait in traffic like i did to transfer packages to a smaller hub. Thats what makes this company exciting to me.

It would be faster, cheaper, and have less people on the road.NFII think you may have missed the boat on Shopify... investing now might be investing at its peak.  Tech is bubbled IMONothing to add but be mindful of the large run-up in the price of SHOP since the March lows ($458 CAD -> $1281 CAD at the time of writing this).> Shop Shopify 

Lol. Shopify is more overvalued than tech stocks were in 2000. Yes, nobody knows when the bubble will pop. But why on earth would you enter into a bubble this late in the game?Why do you think those are good picks?CJT is my top performer now. They practically own the Canadian market and I wonder if they will ever expand internationally.I like logistics and transportation going into a (potential) recovery. TFII is my bet. It's had a nice run-up already though so I'm not sure I'll hold through Q2 earnings.I was looking at CJT back when it was < $100, and I sorely regret not buying then. I don't know enough about the company to have a good opinion going forward, curious what others think.Cameco & NexGen.......all things uranium!!
(Don't forget a few of us on the TSX Venture:))Shopify is great. Think about how e commerce will be evolving in the new 1-2 years. Results out next week and everyone is predicting it to be beaten. I would buy some before results next weekGoeasy's growth potential is limited to the number of people who are both poor and lack financial sense.

Edit: They lease furniture and electronics at annual interest rates of 50-100%.FR.TOCAEIf I were you I'd park most of it in a HISA because everything is pretty overvalued right now. My "stable" covid pick is [CNR.TO](https://CNR.TO) though. Pretty much anything that deals with shipping/goods transpo is a good pick. Even if most flights get grounded again you'll still have trains going across the country. CP might be another good one. Only picked CN because dividend was OKish and growth was stable. It's shot up in this market like everything else though which worries me.PLC and EMP-ASpeculative picks, they can go anywhere rlyAll good picks  PTU got hammered in May. It looks like someone with a large position baled post COVID hit. They are coming back now from a bargain price. They consistently have good volumes and have made back half of what they lost in May. Good entry point.FVL, UEX, or GXU for pure % gains (heck FVL is already up near 50x from 52 week lows). Notable: look for Silver plays like KTN, AAG, IPT as well and other uranium companies like EFR or NXE to make heads spin. Of course these are not growth stocks!!

Gold and silver are running and this is only the beginning imo.This looks interesting with the 5% yield but what does the long term growth look like?Like Tesla but with a 100x better valuation. (Electric buses in case  that isn't well known)Bubbled for a decade , and perhaps for a decade to comeAs long as certain sectors are shut down due to covid, i.e. transportation, hospitality, brick and mortar retail, people will invest their money where they can get decent returns. That means tech, healthcare, and biotech. Once we get back to normal in  12 to 24 months, then maybe we can talk about a tech bubble.that's what everyone says about tech

as the bulls say, you gon miss out if you think these ath's aren't gonna get smashed real soon imagine watching from the sidelines and missing out on gains just cus there was a big run upThe worrying thing about Shopify is that you can't avoid it if you're passively invested in the broad Canadian market. It's now the top holding (excess of 6%) of XIU, VCN, and ZCN. Although I suppose you could avoid it entirely by investing in Canadian dividend ETFs...Growth potential with the economy reopening or staying stagnant as I believe we will avoid a second downturnThey technically already serve some international routes, Bermuda, Lima, Bogotá, Cologne. I can’t see them expanding too much more internationally, though. They’d be going up against giants like UPS, FedEx, Amazon Air in the US and Cargolux, DHL, etc in Europe.The majors on the TSE will rise (CCO/NXE) but the juniors will roar on the Venture.Cameco is still sitting on billion cash. NexGen has a better deposit then Fission due to it's location. Those would be my picks too.I realize their business model makes some uneasy but the fact remains they are posting healthy earnings YoY and growing at a rapid clip. Their interests rates are 350% lower than the average PDL establishment and poor people who lack financial sense will always exist.Yeah I lumped this in with my other morally questionable ideas like US prisons and tobacco.Shoulda told me this yesterday lolWhy?CAE went on a glorious rip from 18 to 28 shortly after missing earnings.  Back down to about 20 now.  What's in the future for this company?NXO is on a tear. They have just signed with Qualcomm and nVIDIA. More companies to be announced.too late to sink in for meThey have the market for Electric Buses and have most of their contracts run through governments, prior to the pandemic they bought out a few other manufacturing companies, I believe some in the UK.

They cut their dividend to i believe .21/s but I do believe with their business being with government and the potential to be commercial it’s a good long term stock, might not be a 2020 winner but if you’re in it for the long haul it should perform.Absolutely nothing like Tesla. NFI is a straight up manufacturing play with no moat. It is a solid company and incredibly cheap on some metrics (e.g. trading at .25 times sales) but its margins are shrinking, it paid too much for a legacy coach business that will act as a drag on performance for at least the next two years, and its revenue costs are increasing faster than revenues. To make matters worse there is tons of competition in the electric bus space and some of these companies are far more innovative. Nevertheless its a solid company with a good sized order backlog and its certainly worth 15 or 16 bucks a share.LOL.

I thought he meant "No fucking idea". and it was super upvoted. I was confused. Thanks.It's not a question of the big run up in tech, its more about whether you think the price of SHOP is justifiable (up 141% YTD compared to companies like MSFT or AAPL which are up 31% and 29%, respectively). Tech in general stands to benefit from covid but is the 280% increase in SHOP price since March sustainable or indicative of its business value?Spoken like someone who has never seen a bubble pop. Good luck.I've had SHOP stock for a while and recently sold half my shares because it's valuation is absolutely bonkers.

If you've been a long term investor it's absolutely time to take some profits.Shopify would need to grow at 50% annually for the next 10 years straight to justify the current valuation.Its always changing. Lima and Bogota were chartered runs and not there at the moment. Bermuda is also a chartered run. Some of those contracts are supplied by FedEx or ups. so completely agreed with their limited international expansion.
source - I work there.Which juniors do you like?  I have AZZ, CCO, NXE, DML, FCU, EFR, U, and GLO on the TSX.  I also hold GXU.V and ISO.V (and have done quite well with ISO already).

I'd love to throw a few more grand into a small basket of lottery-ticket junior names before it's too late,  but I don't consider myself well-informed enough to properly evaluate those sorts of companies.  I keep hearing good things about UEX, SYH, EU and PTU and was thinking of taking a better look at those, or even FMC (last time I looked they were $0.085 and now it's $0.14...)Uranium Participation Corp if you want to invest directly in the metal. They hold and trade physical uranium.Cameco should also get a significant amount of cash back that is being withheld by the CRA.  I forget the numbers but I think it is around $300-500m.It's a good stock. More importantly the CEO is a huge cheerleader for silver, a la Bruce Linton for cannabis. 

Still has room to go up I think.I'm not buying CAE for the short term, management is A1, i'm betting on a recovery in the aviation sector over the next year ans CAE is my play. I think it's less risky than a plane company. Also they got a contract for respirator with the government. Finally, I think they can expand their medical and army contract. Oh and Boeing might need to do a lot of formation for their new Boeing 737.Just looked at all the people working there.  They have a very inexperienced staff, but the C-level seems ok.  The tech looks promising but we've seen optics before and unless they can bend light better and have the algorithm to do crazy things better than established companies I'm not sure this is the Billionaire maker people want it to be.

Plus - on a whim I wanted to see if I could sign up as an Nvidia Partner and I did it as an individual.  Doesn't mean much to be an Nvidia partner.Not at all. Gold is running again after having consolidated the last 2 days and silver is consolidating as we speak for another leg up. Don't take my word for it though.Was there a slowdown on the back orders or something for the price to slip this much? They always get tons of gov contracts. Does BYD pose a serious threat to their business?I'm just wondering if we'll see cuts to some of those gov't purchase programs with the current budget issues countries are having.Ha, its funny how we have opposing opinions based on the same info.  For me, the high yield and gov’t contracts are two reasons to avoid.  There is a secular trend into electromobilty, so the fact that they are paying out capital instead of investing in growth shows that management is not serious about long term growth.  And having revenues tied to the whims of politicians?  No thanks!> Absolutely nothing like Tesla. 

You're right NFI is not a garbage stock it actually makes money. Almost a billion dollars net loss. That should get the Tesla lovers POed.That is likely the most accurate answer though.Shop isn't a investement , it's a gamble100% gain = sell 50% of position. Play with house money and you'll have a stress-free life when it comes to investing. That's my goal anyway hahawhat data points do you reference to come to that?

what is a top pick of yours?Thanks for clarifying!  I knew yous had some international destinations, didn't know they were more or less charters.All good picks  PTU got hammered in May. It looks like someone with a large position baled post COVID hit. They are coming back now from a bargain price. They consistently have good volumes and have made back half of what they lost in May. Good entry point.Still trading at a discount to NAVJust curious, you signed up as a partner, or a preferred partner. 

"NexOptic Technology Corp. (“NexOptic” or the “Company”) (TSX VENTURE: NXO) (OTCQB: NXOPF) (FSE: E3O1), an innovator in optics and AI, announced that it has joined the NVIDIA Partner Network as a preferred partner."I don't own directly any shares in Tesla, and it may well be overvalued given the huge execution risks, but it is hardly a garbage stock and if you think that it has a market cap that is more than 250 times that of NFI just because investors are irrational, then you probably shouldn't be investing. Unlike NFI Tesla is not just an electric vehicle manufacturer but also a technology R&D firm, a software company, an AI company, and an infrastructure company. To pick one example that ought to bring clearly into focus the distinction between Tesla and NFI, if Tesla were simply to auction off the approximately 15 billion miles driven of data that it has collected, one of its competitors in the autonomous vehicle market would be willing to pay at least 10 times the market cap of NFI, *just for Tesla's data*.It was on one of the investing subs, but I don't have the post handy.   


In short, to trade at an Amazon P/E multiple of 150, Shopify would need to deliver an EPS of $6.40 ($800 million profit annually). Their last quarter was something like -130 million for net income. So they're about $1 billion away from making it happen, roughly speaking.   


I'm not heavily invested in things listed on the TSX. I prefer to buy the American versions for options liquidity (covered calls and protective puts).   


Some companies I like near the current SP are NFI (electric buses), FLT (drone delivery), VFF (cannabis), and APHA (cannabis with a wholly owned German pharmacy).   


I would buy WELL on a dip, and also consider a flyer on shroom stocks.Interesting.  Thanks.  I had meant to look into PTU before so I think I'll take a closer look at it now, then.I didnt see an option for preferred partner.trailing P/E and sales without context is irrelevant.

when transactions take place for various products, because of business models, it counts as revenue for Amazon, but not Shopify.

If Walmart sells a Nike shoe it counts the entirety of the sale as revenue. If Nike store sells a shoe in a brookfield mall, brookfield only counts the royalty portion as revenue. Similar comparable can be done for Amazon and Shop on some transactions.

Genuinely feel people will continue going surprise pikachu face as institutions keep making the smart plays (inclusive to holding SHOP which has such a small retail investor appetite). On the other hand, the popular retail names do meh.

The space SHOP operates in is gargantuan - literally the online mall operator - and they currently are the market leader with a handful of serious contenders.

Look at GMV, using that metric you will see Shopify is actually cheaper then Amazon.

im sure some weed and shroom stocks will do fine, however, at it's core, it's a commodity (most weed stocks treat it as such). Did some DD on VFF and big nope. I honestly recommend you do hard research to make sure you understand risk in them, their only real advantage is that it's competitors don't have top grade management(in my pov). Using metrics, FLT more expensive then SHOP ;).Kcc.vn , faf and ar.to are my penniesIt was down at the bottom of the page to sign up as a partner.

I have just seen it on fire lately and looked into the company. I think that Geruson fellow has some connections as he was executive level at Nokia and Lexmark.Meh if you wanna FOMO into SHOP at this point, be my guest.

Flipkart and BigCommerce are competitors, and Shopify has an awful interface for ERP/inventory systems. Great for mom & pop businesses, but rona will kill most of them off not to worry! Also, it'll never work for anything in high demand, since someone can buy what's in your cart before you finish your transaction.

And Shopify can't really tap into markets like China, India, and Brazil, mainly due to the pricing ($ vs local currency) and general nationalism.

To top it off, it's literally trading at a higher sales multiple than Amazon was at the peak of the dotcom bubble. It took Amazon until the end of 2009 to reach the dotcom price. Not saying it'll be this long for Shopify, but it's beyond overvalued.

&#x200B;

>Did some DD on VFF and big nope

Crushing it with one of the top rec brands, 3 of the top 5 products in Ontario, and not bleeding cash like their competitors. Also managing to make money selling their product at rock bottom prices. Aphria is the better pick, as is Cronos with their balance sheet strength. For reference, 80% of the money is currently spent illegally, so each good company can easily triple their sales, and we'll just be at 60/40 between rec & illicit.

>shroom stocks will do fine, however, at it's core, it's a commodity

If shroom stocks and psychedelic medicine are a commodity, so is every biotech and big pharma :)Fair enough.  I did it quickly.  I see the stock popped today as well.-Although Heinz is owned by Poppa Warren, dunno if I would categorize it as a 'mom and pop' shop ;). Careful on 'it'll never work' that comment could sting (I'm sure you could play denial about it later on, so its a pretty safe comment nonetheless). 

-you can't IP 'shrooms' you can IP a cancer treatment / drug (and then sell rights to it). Big pharma and shroom providers are very different business models. To that effect, apha a pdeffered choice.

best of luck on your picks :)In its current state, can shopify support soft allocation? It can't.   


> you can't IP 'shrooms' 

Spoken like someone that doesn't quite understand the sector. Or mushrooms for that matter. Different strains, different extracted compounds, and different formulations with ratios are all on the table. Calling it a commodity only applies to raw shrooms.   
Also, drug-assisted psychotherapy. The industry is in its infancy, and riding the hype train with the right stocks will give FAR better returns than SHOP at its current valuation.   


Although it's on me for not clarifying that by shroom stocks, I'm referring to "alternative" or non-allopathic medicine that involves psychedelics and other currently-classified substances.   


Best of luck to you as wellFirst of all. Skipping US stocks is the worst decision you can make. Second, witholding taxes are only calculated on dividends and it's already taken off the yield automatically.  Third, go to Yahoo finance and compare the history between VCN, Canadian market vs VFV, US market.

Also, the safe dividend stocks may pay a 3-5% yeild per year, but they're relatively flat. Look at the gains US tech is making per month. Of course, past performance doesn't blah blah blah. Either way, it's a bad idea to totally avoid the US market. Their companies due business internationally.

Edit. Also witholding tax is 15% on the dividend. the S&P500 yields about 1.8%. You're not gonna notice 15% of 1.8% missing. So until you have maybe over 50k in your rrsp, then it'll be worth switching over to VOO or another US listed etfDon’t avoid US market, I have been trading both US AND CAD stocks and have had 3x more return on US shares than CAD shares. cad stocks are amazing for dividends because no tax !You need US & international stocks. NeedDividend investing has historically been a worse form of investing than the basic S&P500 ETF or a NASDAQ ETF. You're still young and have a long time horizon, VGRO is still pretty conservative with a high percentage in bonds.

As a last note, avoiding the US market in general is probably not a good idea at this time as there are so many more options for companies you would want to invest in.At your age, your Canadian stock picks have limited growth.

* RioCan will earn you little. Just the dividends ... Just put it in a US index and you will do better. I got rid of all REITs and have no interest in them.
* Enbridge is just about to have life more difficult to build new pipelines. The young voters are environmentally focus. Not a bad income investment but not growth
* TD is fine but it's probably market average.

At 29, you have time on your side. You need some higher growth stocks ENGH, ATD.B, and the likes. You look for high dividend growth rates.Personally I go 70% VGRO, 20% VSP (I want more exposure to u.s market than what vgro offers), 10% in canadian renewable energy stocks (I’m bullish in this sector)Honestly, as others have mentioned, you are missing out on the US stocks. Frankly, that is where the big $ is made. There are barely any CDN growth stocks worth mentioning. If I was you, I’d aim for US growth stocks combined with CDN divdend stocks but not sure about your risk tolerance.I like your plan. Don't listen to everyone saying you NEED growth. No, if it's not your risk tolerance that's fine. Personally, if you are going with safe dividend paying stocks, don't have any bonds or REITs.   

Why? First, because what's the point of bonds? To sell during crashes to buy more stocks. Problem is we just had a big crash, and bonds are at All Time Highs in price. Second, you are in safe dividend stocks that only crashed 25% ish in March, you won't be able to rebalance for much profit. Third, bonds historically gone up in price during crashes have very little capital appreciation possible right now. Fourth, you have a small portfolio, and trading costs will eat up your profits if you rebalance, when DRIP is free just has to be set up. 

You don't need US stocks, but you might want International stocks. BUT since you are in such safe stocks, there's not much difference in utility stocks worldwide. If you want diversity tho, look at BIP.UN.TO. It's an international utility dividend paying stock that focuses on growth in cheap international markets. And it trades in $CDN.  

Also, if you do want bonds still, try looking at gold instead. It's outperformed bonds for the last decade while being just as safe :). Franco Nevada or Sprott Physical Gold ETF are great options.Canada has good dividend stocks in banking and oil sector. But it has very little growth and tech stock (other than shopify which is overpriced at the moment).

If you're scared of withholding tax you can invest only in growth stock (google. amazon. etc..) that dont even pay dividend in the us, and in canada you invest in dividend stock. Thats what i do.

Also look at VDY.to its a good etf w higher dividend than VCE.Tech man all the way  , you are  young why waste  your prime investing years with low growth  Canadian boomer dividend  stocks . Look into Tec and XIT  to get your feet wet then move on to bigger better individual USD tech  stocks/ETFs  when your investing knowledge and capital increasesVEQT would be my recommendation.You mention you have no savings right now. Priority one for me would be building a 3-6 month living allowance cushion in savings. Priority two would be knocking down any debts with over 3-4 percent interest. Wouldn’t even consider stocks right now until those were done firstWhy not buy US Stocks?Unpopular opinion, but I've gone the similar canadian only rout.

HOWEVER I'm virtually only invested in tech and progressive industries. Being invested in a severely political bonanza that is the US makes me a tad nervous. Today it's a 15% withholding tax, who knows what's next when Trump decides its no bueno peeps from China and India and Canada get wealthy holding American companies? Not something I'm wanting to monitor. I noped outta there!

There's ALOT to invest in Canada, not everything - but alot. (P.S. even with a need for more context, I do not recommend ENB, TD, and RioCan. I do not see how there's any case for these companies to have a growing share of the economic pie over time - aka underperformance.)This. Just avoid high dividend US stocks, but for example I hold QQC which tracks the NASDAQ 100 and it's up 10% in the last month while most of my Canadian holdings are flat. The dividend is about 0.5% so I barely even notice the 15% withholding tax. 

I definitely recommend you go for VGRO or VEQT or make your own portfolio if you know what you're doing.How does investing in Canadian ETF's that follow the S&P500 compare? For example are there any advantages of investing in SPY directly over a canadian tracked version of this etf (I think xuu is one).No, there's nothing wrong with not buying US stocks at all. BUT there is a lot wrong with only buying Canadian. 1) means you don't buy what you are not comfortable with 2) means lack of diversity.The whole 3% to 5% is during the normal times

Right now there are lot of Canadian stock with low risk 5% to 10% dividendI compared VCN and VFV and indeed the VFV has a much more aggressive upwards trajectory when compared over the last 5 years. Definitely don't want to miss out on that! So it seems VGRO with its decent chunk of US stocks is the way to go. I'm thinking of perhaps going 90% VGRO and maybe 10% VRE which is a CDN real estate ETF since VGRO doesn't seem to go into that sector.How do you put taxes on profits made from trading US stocks? Especially if they are being held in a TFSA. Does the bank just generate you’re profits and an accounts deducts come tax time?Do you have any recommendations for renewable ENERGY stocks? I've been considering BEP.Ya i think I'm going to go with VEQT with a little bit of VRE which is a CDN real estate ETF with decent dividends. Might throw in a US based ETF in future for additional US exposureYa i was considering VDY. I might drop a bit of money into that next month! Ya I think I will go with VEQT (instead of VGRO) and a little bit of  real estate with VRE (5-10%) and no individual stocks until I learn  more. I changed my mind from VGRO to VEQT to give myself the flexibility  to add bonds later if I want. I got two \~430 pg books (stock investing  for dummies and a random walk down wall street) that I want to skim  through before I do anything else. VEQT and VRE seem like good ETFs that  I can throw money into while I learn at my own pace.I do have an emergency fund sitting in my chequing account. I meant that I have no savings for retirement or a big purchase like a house down payment. I don't see a house happening anytime soon though so I feel like I can safely invest for the long term for now. But I agree for anyone else looking at the thread to do what you suggest!People have convinced me not go CDN only. My initial plan is now scrapped xD

I put my initial 1k into VEQT and a small bit into VRE.Canadian tech sector is so small.Interesting perspective. I don't necessarily agree, but I see the logic. But...a 'rout' is when a line is broken in battle and the defenders are overwhelmed.

A 'route' is a road or path.

Post-scripts don't need to be in parentheses because they're *post-scripts*. If it's a wandering aside then it's not ps. And don't close out paragraphs with parentheses, it's ugly - use dashes or semicolons instead.What’s wrong with XGRO ?Imagine if everyone in the world did the same, and imagine the premium growth would trade at over value. Oh wait...There is only an advantage in an RRSP account. For example - VFV, Canadian listed and VOO, US listed, are ETFs that track the S&P500. No difference outside an RRSP account, you'll get the witholding tax deducted either way. However if you hold VOO in an RRSP, you'll avoid the tax while holding VFV, the tax is already deducted from the yeild. US listed stocks are not subjected to a dividend witholding tax in an RRSP. Hope that helps!Your portfolio will never be diversified if you don't have a single US stock.Sounds like a plan!VFV over VGRO.I would say VFV is better go as well, but I would really wait for some time before getting in. The valuation levels we have right now aren’t valuation at all, because there is no value in it. 

On another note, if you can’t fill in TFSA to the limit, or no plan to do that anytime soon, then do whatever you want. However, if there is the plan to contribute to your TFSA to the maximum, I would say hold dividend paying equities in a non-registered account.You pay 15% tax on US DIVIDENDS and it’s deducted automatically by the bank because it’s tax and goes where tax goes - GOVT , even if held in TFSA. It’s us equity that you made capital gains onAQNNPI and INERNWRandom walk down wall street is a fantastic read. By far the most comprehensive and informative book I've read. You will learn so much from it.Definitely don’t avoid US stocks for no reason, but take some of the advice here with a grain of salt. I usually only trade on the TSX.
I would actually try to time the market, all you need is one piece of bad news to send a bunch of these etfs or stocks down several %Yeah, the only Canadian stocks I own are miners. Oh, and some TD that I got on a lol'y standing buy limit and a bit of cannabis exposure. 

The Canadian economy is energy, finance, auto, and service. Those are low growth and shrinking. Look elsewhere to park your cash. Or, if you fucking love Canada, go for a solid mid-cap miner with good fundamentals and room to grow.

Or, the smart thing to do is to just buy Apple and hold it.Agreed. I recently started adding XIT as it might be the one canadian equity that gets me anywhere growthwise.yep, but there are some. Enough that I see value in to keep me contentThanks :)Nothing. It's the bastard child that no one acknowledges despite a lower MER and higher US content.Hey, incredibly helpful. Thanks guy.He can own US operating companies traded in TSX like AQN with a lot of revenue from USA. Or US stocks listed in TSX. Don't need to go to US stock market. Besides, lots of Canadian firms have exposure to US.I have literally no savings (aside from an emergency fund) atm and I turned 18 in 2009 so I have the full 69k or w/e it is atm of TFSA room. I will probably contribute about $500/mo to ETFs until I hopefully get a higher paying job in engineering. No chance of filling it up anytime soon though!Why hold dividend in non registered ? 

I’m just getting under way with a dividend portfolio in my TFSA.to clarify I’m talking about equities. So if I buy and sell a US stock in my TFSA and make $1k profit, how do I pay the withholding tax on that profit?What do you guys think about ZUT.TO?

The MER isn't cheap, but I have a hard time making up my mind on a single stock.How can you be so wrong on so many levels 

Brb jumping off a bridge after reading your postUS stocks listed in TSX are US stocks. 

Canadian firms have exposure to US, sure. But it won't be enough.If the yield factor is important to you, here are the two names that frequently show up here, both decent: XEI and VDY. That is, after you finished your trading the stocks.Just want to be clear here: OP wants yield from Canadian companies. If there is requirement to have yield paid by foreign companies, particularly US companies, the answer will be different. 

Holding Canadian dividend payer in non-reg accounts allows you to take advantage of the Canadian dividend tax credit. If you do that in a reg account, it doesn’t matter because investment income in those accounts will be tax-treated differently. While your TFSA room is already limited and tax-free on investment income, it makes sense to keep Canadian dividend payers in non-reg account to make room to invest in other higher taxed investment.Don't sweat it when you start. Fill up your TFSA and then you can figure out where to put it afterwards.

It took me years to fill my TFSA and RRSP and then I started using my non-registered.

Some investors get way too caught up on details that have little impact. Only suggestion is to not hold REITs or ETFs in a non-registered unless you are ready to do some really good accounting for taxes due to distribution.

You can see my portfolio (around $1M) and where I hold what: [https://dividendearner.com/dividend-stocks-portfolio/](https://dividendearner.com/dividend-stocks-portfolio/)You don't pay taxes on the growth of the stock...so if your portfolio grows by $1000, you would not pay any taxes on that gain in a TFSA. The withholding tax is only on the dividends you get paid.From what I know, you won't pay tax when selling the equities in the TFSA, you pay tax on the US dividends which are collected by the IRS before you get the remainder of the payout.Withholding tax only applies to dividends, not capital gain.You don't it's tax freeFair point, I assumed he meant $CDN, as in on TSX not necessarily only Canadian companies. That would be stupid to not invest in a great stock on TSX solely it being in USA. Lots of great mining stocks are in USA and listed TSX.Aww I see.  Thank you.OP, I might suggest posting this to r/personalfinancecanada as this question requires a lot more consideration than "which is a better investment". I am by no means an expert in retirement (I'm 25 lol) nor do I work in finance, but immediately these questions, which I would be asking myself were I in your shoes, come to mind:

- How old are your parents? How many years can they expect to benefit from that pension?
- Do your parents have any other sources of retirement income or savings?
- Do your parents have any significant debt, such as a mortgage?
- Do your parents want to leave any money to their kids when they pass? Does their pension have some form of payout or transferability if one of your parents passes away?

All of these things, and way more, should be considered before choosing either option. Don't forget, the pension fund wouldn't offer the one time payment if it wasn't potentially beneficial to them. In any case, go ask PFC and I'm sure they will have some guidance for you and possibly some better questions than I could ask.630 a month never adjusting for inflation?

:/I'd take the 170K at one go and invest it assuming there aren't penalties for taking the 170 in one goroughly how old are they

also hypothetically speaking, they could get $858.14 dividend from XEI per month if it's 170k all-in at today's closing price and if there is no dividend cut. of course you should diversify and there are other things to consider, but i'm just using XEI as a benchmark sort of.Is your parent male or female and how is their health.Depends if the lump sum is taxed at once or not, big differenceNot adjusted for inflation, she will break even in roughly 22 years. I would 100% take the 170k. Worst case scenario, you leave it in a HISA and withdraw 630/m. At least you will get a little bit more than 22 years and will have more flexibility to decide later on to invest a portion of it if you wish to do so.How old are your parents?
In general the lump sum sounds better.If they can operate at a 4% or less withdrawal rate, the lump sum sounds like a no-brainer to me. Some people do like the security, but they would need to take $630 per month for over 22 years to break even with the 170k @ 0%....I'd take the lumpsum and invest. You can likely do abit better investing your self and also don't run the risk of your pension being cut.Take the $170k and invest. Take out $630 a month and gift their kids the $170k when they pass on.That payment is almost 4.5%.0Take the one 170. Put in Rio can and get 10 % dividend.I'm guessing this is choosing between an annuity or investing.

I personally don't like annuities, though they do have their place. For instance, if your parent is older or has poor quality of life. Otherwise, if I were in a situation where my parent was healthy, I'd go the low risk/dividend investment route. It pays a similar amount, and at the end of the day you retain the value of the lump sum.We don't have enough information. 170k 1 time payment into a rrsp, do they have the room for that kind of contribution? 

Is it an actual "payment" or is it a transfer? Like, is this a RPP, which they contributed into or was a benefit during their employment? 

You need the details, depending the nature and characteristics of the payment, and the tax position of your parents,  the lump sum may not be beneficial. As an example, if it's a straight up payment, and they only have, say 60k in RRSP room, then they will be taxed on 110k, could bring the payout down to 130k, easily. Keeping it simple, at 5%, you need a aftertax investment amount $152,000 in order to get $630 per month. And again, that's based on a simple calculation. 

If they are talking about transferring it from a LIRA to another LIRA, or a  LIRA to  a LIFF, then you have to analyse the regulations around the LIFF and the LIRA. 

It's not as simple as people make it out to be. Sure, if you can make more money investing it yourself, you should take the lump sum, but you don't know if you can. It's not as simple as "how much dividend can I get?".Get 170k, buy 12000 shares of REI.un , get paid 1400 a month plus 100% capital gain in 3 to 5 yearsParent is 57.Ya, you can do better than 5% all in safe bets. That’s the route I’d take. NWH-UN, CHP-UN, BCE, RNW... easy 6%>I might suggest posting this to r/personalfinancecanada as this question requires a lot more consideration than "which is a better investment".

Follow this advice.>Don't forget, the pension fund wouldn't offer the one time payment if it wasn't potentially beneficial to them. 

This.

Nails the issue entirely.Correct, no inflation adjustment.yepyeah, into some investment that pays better dividends and will grow over time.Only 1 parent who is female and 57. She is healthy.Into the RRSP. So I imagine it shouldn’t be.It would go into a locked in RRSP and would not be taxed.Thanks. Honestly the question was more about the stuff I did not know than the actual investment. I found out from here that it can't be a simple transfer as there is a max amount that can be sheltered which kills the whole thing.are they the type to piss the money away?

\- take the $630

are they responsible savers/investors?

\-take the lump sumTake the 170K. 

Solely into your RRSP will allow you to grow it by minimum 4% per year and you’re already ahead of the 630/mo. Plus you’ll get the tax refund.Again, that piece of fact isn't enough to make a definitive decision.  There are many things to consider. Just because it isn't tax sheltered, doesn't mean it's beneficial for you to get the monthly payments. 

Honestly, this is the kind of thing you should discuss with either an accountant, or an experienced financial planner (not the ones at the banks).  They can do a bunch of analysis for you, and they'll be able to use the actual information (RRSP limitation, TFSA limit, your parent's tax rate etc etc). They can come up with a plan where, they may pay some taxes initially, but in the long run, it will benefit them. As I've said before, these things aren't so simple that they can be resolved with 1 fact (ie. not all of it is tax sheltered), or by answering one question (eg. can I get more investing the money myself?). 

All I'm telling you is, there are some things in life that can be simplified, and some things that can't. I would not make a decision based on the information you receive from this subreddit, there certainly are a lot of knowledgeable people here, but the decision you and your parents make could cost them tens of thousands of dollars over the next few decades. Take feelings out of it, speak to a experienced professional who gives a shit about his clients, and make a decision based on the combination of facts that are applicable to your parent's situation.Best answer right here. Lump sum is better financially but if your parents are the type to burn through it, take the $630 a month.Thank you. I am not making a decision bases on Reddit recommendations and will be speaking to an accountant. However, I like to hear about people's experiences.Fundamental value investor. I pour at least 50-70hrs of work in to every name I buy. And to buy I answer at least 5 questions:

1. what does the business do? (walkthru and understand every revenue/cash generation process)
2. what does the business have planned for the future? (listen to earnings calls/investor presentations/read annuals and quarterly MD&As
3. Is this business defensible?  How likely is a competitor going to come in and ruin future FCF?
4. What are the risks associated? (ie where can I be wrong, where can the company falter)
5. What price am I a buyer/seller? This creates discipline on buys and sells.  Ive never been caught in momentum shifts using this method, daily changes and even large amounts of volatility dont bother me.I started investing in 2017 following the Canadian Couch Potato model portfolios ([https://canadiancouchpotato.com/model-portfolios/](https://canadiancouchpotato.com/model-portfolios/)). I started out trying the TD e-series with small amounts of money but as I got more confident with investing I switched to the 3 fund portfolio (ZAG, VCN, XAW) and have most of my money invested at this point. Since the virus situation back in March I've sold all of my bonds and switched to a 100% equity portfolio so these days I'm mainly trading VCN and XAW in my accounts.

My current strategy is pretty simple. Monthly I invest exactly the same amount of money and purchase either VCN or XAW whichever is lower in my portfolios. I try to keep the balance between 30% - 40% VCN and the rest XAW but I don't worry about exact %s very much.

I have 3 accounts for CASH, TFSA, and RRSP; I try to keep exactly the same asset allocation in all 3 accounts so I don't stress about optimizing that at all.

My goal is to max out my TFSA every January 1st so I budget for that near the year end and invest in my RRSP between Sept - Dec to lower my tax bracket. Otherwise I put my money in my taxable cash account the rest of the year (I don't know if this is the best way to go about it but that's what I'm doing now).

Finally I do dabble in stock picking and buy companies I like by selling my ETFs if I think there's a good buying oppurtunity. I find it not worth doing in small amounts so I like to wait until I have a larger amount before purchasing stocks.I personally do not have a dividend stock portfolio but it is something I might transition too later in life. I am currently at the point that I use all-in-one ETFs like XEQT to grow my principal because I know that I won't have to touch that money for decades. Also because of the strength of the American markets I choose to double dip and invest another 25% into VFV;(all in my TFSA).i roll a diceI am month trader. I decide on position once a month or so, analyzing the conditions for ticker (financials/company news) and related industry (trends) over last 24-48 months. With under 60 positions it keeps me busy enough to avoid major losses I used to have when I was reading online investment advise and "in-depth" analysis.

I found it pretty expensive lesson to learn that ALL of "analysis" are 100% paid for. No exceptions. No matter how nicely worded. If analysis is among top 5 pages of search results in Google - they have been paid for. And average reader is the one paying ultimately.Tried daytrading, investing in weeds, real estate, ran some optimizing spreadsheet.. So far Tangerine's growth mutual fund and tech index were the most successful. I have some dividend investing mostly because it feels good psychologically to see an amount deposited every month.I differ from the demographic here fairly substantially being retired - or maybe semi-retired?  My primary source of retirement income comes from my 3 rental properties.  I also rely on a steady income from investments, although very little comes from dividends.  

I'm not very good at investing generally so a substantial part of my RRSP's are in lower fee mutual funds like Mawer.  I like managed investing.  I have some of the remainder of my allocation in lower risk funds such as TD managed income ETF's, some conservative ETF's such as VCNS, XBB and VBAL and low volatility equity ETF's like ZLU and ZLB.  I dabble in my TFSA with some dividend producing individual stocks and such, but those have generally not done that well.  I really don't need more growth since in 10 years or so when I get tired of managing rental properties, I will sell them and have that cash inflow.  My income has actually grown in retirement from 2015 at 56 to now and my RRSP (now RRIF) / TFSA nest egg hasn't dropped much.  

This is how my retirement income works:

* Rental income: 50%

* RRSP's: 25%

* CPP: 23%

* Side gigs: 2%I invest for long term. The only times I will try to time the market is when important news come up such as when Apple announced in mid February that the virus was affecting both their operations and access to shipment from China. If Apple is impacted, so will the other players. I therefore sold 75% of my portfolio at that point and rebought the same positions in late March. Yes, very nice gains.

75-80% of my portfolios are invested in ETFs. The other 25-30% in individual stocks. In both cases (ETFs and stocks) I DRIP.

I use Simply Wall (paid subscription) and Yahoo finance (free) for research.I  am 50% indexing and 50% stock picking. I mostly pick tech and Momo stocks. Winners keep winning!I put 98% of my money in VEQT and the other 2% of my hard earned cash into stocks of businesses I recognize the name of without doing a lick of research.I started up with VGRO and became frustrated by its relatively small growth (due to it being fairly conservative for a young person) compared to individual stocks I wanted to own instead. Switched to owning large-cap stocks on the NYSE and NASDAQ rather than investing in Canadian companies as my personal belief is that the US ones are more stable over the long run plus I didn't fall in love with any companies trading on the TSX.

I hold about 15% of my portfolio in VOO and TEC but other than that it is in individual (mostly tech) growth companies.I thought we all just bought VGRO?If you want to learn about dividend investing, I recommend [this book](https://www.amazon.ca/Get-Rich-Dividends-Earning-Double-Digit/dp/1118217810)

I am a long term dividend investor. Yes, I played with weed stocks. Like you, and because of my investment style, lost a lot of unrealized gains. Growth stocks require regular diligence.[removed]I rebalance my portfolio to what I see.  During a run like we were on in tech i would have USD in risk assets such as ark funds and tqqq, with daily updated profit taking orders parked well below market. 

These days I am overwhelmingly fixed income an renewable power and Brookfield.Since you asked for make money strategy and not just investments I’ll share mine. Decided to move to the arctic in one of the arctic to more than double my salary. Im in my 20’s so I’m just dumping everything I can into WealthSimple, saving up to buy some real estate (income properties) back home in Québec.I’m primarily a dividend investor. I haven’t been investing long but I started with swing trading in the beginning, it made a lot of money but I started learning more and more about dividends and the power of compound interest. I’m really young and if I can build a dividend portfolio that can sustain itself over my life and change it whenever it needs to, I think it would yield more than focusing on growth or trading. I still struggle with being confident in my strategy ad my position is not the largest, but I think for 20 I’m doing alright. Based on what I’ve seen eith dividends, the returns from compound interest over a lifetime seem most favourable to me and require the least amount of effort.We started with rental properties back when they cash flowed and lending rules were more lax, 20 years ago.  We leverage a few to 80% with HELOCs, we own outright our primary residence and the rest are a mix of equity and mortgaged.  We use the income and HELOC proceeds to invest and pay ourselves according to a tax model that is the most beneficial to our circumstances.  

We own gold and silver as a hedge against inflation.

Our stock portfolio consists of 80% VGRO 15% individual stocks and 5% cash scattered through TFSA, RRSPs and taxable accounts.

We have an emergency fund and a DB pension plan. 

If markets continue as they are we plan to sell our silver and a couple houses and move into more income producing stocks and bonds.Got any tickers to recommend?Follow a simillar strategy.  Understanding the industry is very important too.I have pretty much the same system. It takes a lot of discipline and rules in place.

I dont day trade everything i buy i buy it long term. Doesnt mean i dont sell mistakes or compagnies i lost faith in or sell portions for profits in spikes.

 I invest 1000$ every 2 weeks and i bulk invest 10 000 (around once a year). I keep a strict list of 20 stocks in 10 different sectors (mining, industrials, consumer defensive, consumer cyclical, finance, tech, healthcare, utilities, real estate, communication). Each sector have a ratio of investment into its stock, and same for the stocks inside each sector. Usually i invest 2% to 5% per each individual stock. I have 20% in tech, 16% finance, 18% industry, 8% gold etc. Each sector is balanced between defensive and growth, large, mid and small cap, etc. I try to focus on what i deem are the best 5 stocks per sector using different caracteristics, then i shorten the list to 3 candidates. I always have at least 1 large cap, 1 mid cap and 1 small cap per sector in the major sectors and only 1 stock to 2 stocks in minor sectors.

I don't keep dead or struggling industries (oil, tabacco, etc.). I try to focus on growth potential compagnies so i dont do divident investing but i will definitly switch to divident investing once i'm on my 60.[deleted]Very underrated strategyI will look into it, thank you.Your account is not old enough

Let's go Canada!Too bad this isn't on wealth simple appInteresting company. Also in a field where there is lots of demand. Lots of things to prove before it's investable for me.

1) they need to get their patent approved (still pending as far as I can find)

2) they can deliver the volumes they promised for the test

3) their product can be used for different applications

4) will have to see how their finances look like when they do get the rest going. Right now it's looking horrible with expenses and debt that is way beyond their assets. Too riskyThere’s a lot of discussion of it on the discord channelThey’re up like 6,000% over a couple months. This still has potential? Newbie here.What influenced your decision to buy when they were at 0.68/sh?0.59 for me.  Been a hell of a ride hasn’t it?Feeling pretty good about that now, arent ya?  :)available on QuestradeYa i wanted to invest in SONA but couldn't find them on wealthsimple so settled with MIR i thought they had potential also but that one might be a pump and dump.I looked on WS and am also disappointed by its absence. :(Seems like most Canadian stocks aren’t :(Very much so. Testing will be key until a vaccine is widely available. The test has other applications beyond COVID19. Great technology.When I saw them on the Federal governments list I knew SONA was legit.What influenced your decision to buy when they were at 0.59/sh?It's been fun!  How high do you think it'll go?  I'm assuming FDA and Health Canada approvals soon.Holy shit. Nice.Yes! I even averaged up today at $13.50 shortly before it went up to $14plus at close. This is not in line with my typical luck with stocks. But let’s keep it going!Cool, thanks. I’ll read up on them. I have a couple thousand I need to place somewhere in a Canadian market and this sounds more exciting than the traditional Canadian companies.Partnership with GE Life Sciences was announced.  It spiked up to about $1, and it caught my attention.  Then I kept an eye on it as it dropped down to 0.50 cents again.  Decided to take a position after reading up on them.Market cap is still only at $528 mill.  They already have millions of preorders and tens of millions of expressions of interest.  They are supposed to announce sales and manufacturing updates by the end of July.  

If they announce 50 million tests at $35 each, that alone is 1.75 billion with no multiplier.  The numbers are staggering.  

Now that it has been validated by a credible lab, most of the risk has been removed.  This will easily sail into the 20’s.  Look at other tests market caps.  We aren’t even at a billion yet.  And a low share count of 60 million to top that off.Were you just watching news in all medical stocks?We might see a share dilution to raise more capital.Covid stocks particularly.   I had a common cold in March so I stayed away from work for 12 days and got tested (Im in healthcare and in and out of hospitals everyday).  My test results took 12 days and it was negative so I went back to work.  

During those 12 days I was reading up on all the companies engaging in the fight against Covid.  This one stood out to me with the GE partnership.  Big companies don’t partner with little companies out of nowhere for no reason.Management has said the 4.1 mill grant is enough to get them through till deposits on preorders come in, but it is possible.I’m long in RioCan and SRU. Huge dividend and I’m confident the share price will recover.Retail defaults are still increasing month-over-month and so far no sign of a slowdown. The odds of a second shutdown occurring once cold weather and flu season hits in October/November/December are what, 50-50? With that much uncertainty why in god's name would any rational investor go chasing a 5.9% dividend yield from a retail REIT when she can get basically the same yield from a company like NTR that is trading at less than 1x sales, has virtually no risk of meaningful capital loss and zero risk of cutting the dividend. And there are at least a dozen other equally good options.Fully agree with your comments. I was long RioCan and stepped away to cover some losses elsewhere. Now wondering whether to come back in before the Q2 results are out which I suspect will increase the stock price. 

Love the high dividend and potential increase in share price. I think Canadian companies have not only weathered the storm better than their US counterparts but have always had good management. 

For me however being so concentrated in real estate has got me thinking. Should I put money in some of the better oil majors. Tbh my only issue again oil is not only the prospects but also the moral issue due to climate change. 

REITS right now seem too good to ignore.Long rio as well, sup teamRio here, I think I'll round it out with Smart Centers unless someone has a better compliment.Great read. I'm also long on RIO and I'm happier being in it right now rather than just holding onto cash. Great upside imoRio here as well. They are pretty well diversified and have some very interesting projects in the pipeline. REITs will recover but I recommend doing some DD on their tenants.How's H and R doing?TL;DR: REITs are recovering! ~~I really hope~~ My investments will pay off!

---

Stop the arm-chair analysis for a sec: put your mask on, and go talk a walk through any of these REITs big properties (if they're even open!). Do it on a Tuesday afternoon. Afterwards, think about what you saw, and if you still think they're on the road to recovery -- by all means -- buy it all up.Old news ? Or did it come after market on Fridayduuh, CECRA.

rent is 75% off, employees are 75% off.

looking forwards to what happens whenever (if ever at this rate) printer stops printing.They better pay their fucking rent

But I'm not touching REIT (I also am not touching anything but VGRO or VEQT but I digress I wouldn't even if I was actively trading)

I don't think anything like that is worth it unless you have hundreds of thousands of dollars and cash to blow... it is not investing it is a business people pay rent

REITs are not the ETF of property they are more like time shares and everyone knows the problem with that

Right now it's praying if you're in REIT and the bag holders want you in so they can cash outHave both as well along with HR, love the long term outlook!I already own NTR, can you share any other of the dozen other equally good options?>The odds of a second shutdown occurring once cold weather and flu season hits in October/November/December are what, 50-50?

At least in Ontario, government and provincial medical officer already said there won't be another shutdown after Phase 3 is everywhere. Any second wave will be responded to with targeted closures. The economy and most people / small businesses will not tolerate nor accept another shutdown. They would simply ignore the directive since shutting down would mean bankruptcy for them anyways, at that point they'd have nothing to lose.There won't be another shutdown. At least not at 50/50 odds.Apartment and residential REITs are still trading low with the same div yieldOil over reit in Canada? It's like saying should buy lottery ticket or Amazon at $100

You are a fool if you don't buy riocan before earning 

Look at 2009 Riocan 

Riocan has 9.6 billion mortgage free asset vs marketcap of 4.6 billionDon’t forget about First Capital (FCR.un). I don’t see it mentioned a lot but they have some strip malls of the same quality as RIocan and Smartcentres. I own all three and adding to my position, the lower the better.I like HR to go along with the big retail reits in my portfolio. They’re not going anywhere anytime soon.50% of my portfolio, 4000 shares at 15.15 year, this is the crime of century, people still think it's the same riocan from 5 years ago.I drove by a few malls in the area and parking lots were packed

You are also trying to invest with a 3 months view mentality.

Whst about 5 years down the road,  10 years ?Same. HR and SRU here. No riocan but that’s only because I ran out of capital for now. With Walmart announcing they will be restructuring many of their Canadian stores to be more modern and competitive that can only mean good things for SRU. 

Love the username btw!As mentioned below, banks and pipelines are both safer than retail REITS but if I were investing mainly for income and capital preservation I'd want as much diversification as possible, so I'd get some ZPR or better yet build a small basket of high grade preferred shares - you'll end up with a yield of somewhere north of 6% with the only real risk of capital loss being a BoC move to negative interest rates. But probably my first choice would be to look at some ETFs with covered call strategies for yield enhancement. Something like ZWE will give you exposure to blue-chip European dividend payers that right now are still trading at very cheap valuations. You get a yield of almost 8% with downside capital loss risk limited both by valuations of the underlying equities and by the covered call strategy. Similar products exist also for sectors that otherwise don't offer enough yield for income investors but that really you should have some exposure to, like healthcare. Good luck!Banks, Gold miners, Suncor/CNQ. All great value stocks right now trading at CRAZY low price/sales or P/E ratios.tbh the banks all have very fat cash piles. i don't invest in 'em, but still.There's the pipes, all swimming in debt, but they also run a monopoly/olli on many of their lines. Telcos.

Not a single one i invest in though, but deff less risky then RiOcAn (and distributions from REITS are taxed, unlike dividends)The actual experts here, the epidemiologists, think that the odds of having a second wave during flu season are high and if that happens it won't matter what the government says right now, or what you think small businesses will or won't accept. Jesus Christ, man, in places like Texas and Flordia openings are being rolled back and you think Canadian governments are going to be more cavalier than Texas? Politicians do what the polls tell them is popular. As soon as cases start to increase dramatically the fear will be sufficient to shutdown non-essential retail. And guess what, even if there is no legal shutdown, the cell phone tracking data clearly shows that as soon as cases start to rise dramatically a huge percentage of the population immediately reverts to hunkering down again. If there is a second wave physical retailers get smashed, there's no wishing your way around that.Yeah I’m a big fan of all 3 companies and thanks!Taxed? So ? 10% dividend tax still pays much much more than 5% yieldNobody here will listen to you on the REITs because they're all neck deep in them and desperately want more people to join their bag-holding party. Anyone who think these are "on sale" is a fool. Also, interestingly, RioCan hasn't said a fucking peep about their real numbers, and I can almost guarantee they're pumping cash into making sure the retail market doesn't sour on them because all the smart money has.

If these stocks were such a steal then where are the hedge funds with all their brrrrr cash? What about the financial institutions, they're spending money like crazy in the market these days, where are their investments going? 0% to this sector. But apparently bag holders on reddit are a better tool for gauging future profitability than the banks and investment firms.Another brainwashed fear mongering doomer. 

It was the Ontario Chief Medical Officer, one of your so-called "experts", that said there won't be another lockdown. It provides limited benefit vs. the harm it caused, versus doing specific targeted shutdowns. 

Fortunately, epidemiology "experts" people like you blindly listen to, the ones who would lock down everything if they could, are only advisors, and not actual decision makers. These ivory tower academic elitists could care less if everyone else goes bankrupt or loses their livelihoods and life savings.someone with a 10% yield from a reit might have to pay back in excess of 50% of that in taxes.distributions. reits don't pay dividends.

makes them comparatively tax complex, and unpredictable how much tax you will be on the hook for, year in year out. (since the 'profits' being distributed fall under a couple different tax codes)Where were all the hedge fund in 2009?

Go ahead and answer that?

Where were all the hedge fund when AMD was trading at $2?

Or intel was trading at $60 before earning? Why was it at 60 but not 50 if your so called know it all and always correct coming back from future hedge fund knew it?Holy fuck are you a moron or what? Not that it matters but I have never personally been in favor of a lockdown, not even back in March and April - my comment history will offer ample proof of that. But I also am not willfully blind to the facts, which are that a) for the same reasons that the flu is highly seasonal, the risks of a much more severe second wave are real; b) people are highly driven by fear, including politicians who above all are afraid of public opinion and c) even in the absence of any change in public policy, consumers that are afraid of the virus will to a large degree avoid physical retail (this is an absolute fact - just look at the cell phone tracking data from Arizona, Florida and Texas over the past two weeks - a huge percentage of the population is once again reverting to self isolation).Ignore the use Dr.Meany he is a fking idiot 

Just ask him where were all the hedge funds not buying riocan at $15 back in 2009An unmitigated second wave will wipe out people’s savings and potentially their lives.Even the name is fucking stupid. Who thought facedrive was a good name for a company?Finally someone picked this up. I made a post about this a week ago. Stock is going to $1.I lucked out - bought 50 shares at $2.77 around the start of the pandemic and sold last week at $27.06. Never touching FaceDrive again.Thats what you get when you have a new breed of investors that buy the social media hype, twitter feeds and fake news instead of financials, balance sheets and  fundamentals. This is just the tip of the iceberg, there are so many stocks pumping their value with nothing by bullshit propaganda and people are buying it in bulk. The consequences won't be noticable in the neer future but the next 3 years will be pretty brutal for a lot of people.Bubble will burst on the tech stocks. There is no rational explanation as to why these keep going up other then FOMO.Motley Fool is pushing this stock like crazy. I went on the Facedrive website after and was like, WTF is this? It’s like someone’s college finance project. Good luck to anyone who buys shares.All the things said in the report are obvious without the supporting numbers. The supporting numbers and trail just seal the deal. I have no idea how anyone believes this is going to be a big company but I see a lot of people talking about it on Facebook message groups comparing it to Shopify.Same can be said for CNSX:SONAthey bought foodora? reminds me that i saw foodora CEO on acadium/gen.m (a website for "marketing apprenticeship") basically asking for free laborBoomers that think Facebook is the latest craze.Its likely heading for 0 if you can wait long enoughYou sir are a great detective. You hit on a multitude of points before the big research company did. Kudos to you!lets just say criticizing tesla, or amazon, or aapl on their 'fundamentals' a few years back would have been weak.

Innovation keeps accelerating and business designed with any form of consistent more and more getting left in the dust.Yeah don't know what's their problem with that. When I started to read about what Facedrive was, I was like: So their trying to be Uber, but their a smaller company who don't have the leverage to be Uber? My money won't die there. Moyhley fool is fool indeed.Thanks, credit goes to a few friends that were very perplexed by how this stock kept running.Problem is not everybody can read charts or is equiped to identify when to sell at top resistance so a lot of people end up bagholding useless stocks in the aftermath ... some brokers have transaction restrictions so people buy but can't sell afterward and need to wait, by the time they can trade again, its all over. Its their own fault for falling for it as no one is forced to invedt but its still taking advantage of people.Td isn’t really lagging, it’s all relative from when you bought in

From 52 week ATH 

Bns down 25%

Cm down 21%

BMO down 31%

Td down 22%

Ry down 16%

NA also down 16%

Banks will continue to play sideways, a lot of people are uneasy due to Covid / oil / housing. If your planning on holding long term than just collect the dividend and smile. If you want to drop a company than look into the institution to understand how the company plans on making you money in the future. I wouldn’t drop a company because it’s been lagging in price since March, esp banks. Just better buying opportunities. 

I would suggest looking into other sectors outside of financials / renewable energy to get better exposure to the market.The logic would be to get the average return of the sector. For example, the the avg annual return for the last 10 years, with dividend reinvested, was:

* BNS: 5.79 %
* BMO: 7.12 %
* CM: 8.3 %
* RY: 9.31 %
* TD: 10.26%
* NA: 11.78 %
* AVG of the 6 banks: 8.76 %

If you invested 10000 $ in BNS, you would have 18 095 $ today vs 32 330 $ with NA.I only own 1 directly, and a little extra exposure to 2 others in a dividend etf. Dont rly need to own all 5 imo.I own TD and RBC. 2 of the strongest in CanadaWhat do you mean when you say that the others are doing better? TD, Royal, and Canadian National seem to be healthier based on what I’ve found, but I’d love to hear what your decision making is based onIn recent memory, I think one of the banks had a data breach, which triggered a quick drop in stock price that recovered after a month. While the Big 5 is very much identical in their core operations, each has slightly different growth strategy like Scotia -> South America, TD -> US.etc. Basically, I think there is a timing difference between them in terms of gain/loss but net out over a medium timeline. Hard to tell if one will outrun another/ any difference over the long term.ZEBYou should be asking, "is there any reason to own a Canadian bank vs another stock?"

Hold all 5, if you don't know which one is better.There's really no reason to hold all 5, unless you're comfortable with a large position in the banking sector. I personally only own 1 of the big 5.

I'm curious to hear why you say TD and Scotia aren't attractive with respect to the other 3. Are there specific metrics that have caught your attention?Sure so some are more focused on income others capital appreciation. And whichever bank is #1 today may not be tomorrow. Hedging.I like ZWBI have td cibc Royal bank. Once things begin to normalize and level out I might consolidate them to just one bank? Or go straight to an etf. But right now it made sense to get these guys on the cheap cheap and collect the dividend while waiting for some of them to return to 100$/unit level> But is there any logic in holding all 5?

yes. In anyone period, one or two will outperform but over longer periods they do better than the market as a whole. Buy all and you're safer than buying one or two. 

See for example, CIBC and NationalNo.None at all.

Look at their accounts - you will find that the level of cross holdings is just ENORMOUS. So you dont really get much diversification.jus buy a bank ETFIs there a reason to own any of the banks? I think not.Just buy an ETF that holds all the Canadian banks. Definitely have to diversify outside of financials.Bmo has the most exposure to oil right? That's why they took the biggest hit?I wonder why Bns lagged so much compared to peersNevermind dividends were taken into account.>be to get the average return of the sector. For example, the the avg annual return for the last 10 years, with dividend reinvest

yep low risk with them as well, and the pay decent dividendsEyeing it but I think a singular good bank pick might be more solid. Less fees, potentially higher dividends / growthThoughts on this vs rbnk?I'm holding KBWD as well.Why when there are fees?I think it's more so anticipation. Everyone knows banks are bracing for defaults. Check this:

The recent wave of mass closings in some markets to focus on the Pacific Alliance is a reflection of that.Riocan for sure.I have equal shares of both and they’re both great companiesBoth are similar on a variety of metrics except 

SmartCentres has much higher insider ownership. Mitchell Goldhar, the founder and executive chairman owns around 45,000,000 shares and has been aggressively buying during the crash. 

Riocan’s CEO Edward Sonshine owns 500,000 shares and did not buy during the crash.Rio is my biggest REIT holding. If they can keep that dividend, I'm happy.I see others saying RioCan, but they're not saying why. I haven't looked at these two too deeply so I could be wrong, but I have a bit of SRU as I trust their main tenant, Walmart, to keep on doing well long into the future (3.5billion investment reported today). I also see that they own large corn fields on the edge of cities and they are developing the area around the subway terminus in Vaughan so they are doing long-term planning.  

RioCan has a much greater number of retailers, but many are gyms, restaurants, and theaters and I heard a couple months ago about some larger retailers like Staples weren't paying their rent. I'm sure their grocery stores will be fine though. 

Anyone with further insight?RioCan is great buy at $15 price point. The reason it got beaten down is the phase 3 is not open until end of July in Toronto region. After phase 3, it will push it further up to $20 fair value price point.

Disclosure: I do own RioCan stocks.RioBoth are good imoBuy both.RioCan. 

settled.I have 10% of my portfolio in VRE. 

Just index and buy everything.[removed]Why not take on both of them? They both are paying like 9% at the moment, so excellent values. If you are determined to increase exposure to retail real estate at the moment, you can’t go wrong with both and you get more exposure with different properties.Y'all sleeping on Granite 🤦 GRT-UN.TO. BEST REIT TO BUY. NO CAPNot sure how much this will affect decision making, but riocan has a much lower payout ratio than smartcentres. I have BPY.UN and HR.UN from pre market crash prices but started a position in Riocan recently. The CEO stated the dividend is safe so hopefully this means they have a good balance sheet and won't bleed into capitalRioI can't give you advice for either of those picks. TBH I would probably go a 50/50 split. But Its also because I have no knowledge on them, it would be like throwing a dart at the bored and hoping it gets close to the middle!RioBoth good. Sru has some hotel/ retirement home exposure which is why i didnt choose it. Q2 will tell the tailNeither, I don't see REITs providing market beating performance. I used to have RioCan and while I did not lose money, it was not worth it.RioCan is trash, there are many better REIT's out there which are not ran by Mr. Biden 2.0 dementia CEO and which half of their tenants are facing bankruptcy. Hell even dumping everything in [TEC.TO](https://TEC.TO) would be safer then RioCan at this point. Unfortunately, juvenile delinquent Robinhood investors on this Reddit will not listen until the Dividend Cut slaps them in the face. 

You have been warned friends :)Same, bought equal shares of both but I have about 20% more Riocan due to DRIP.

The reason I might go for REI right now is because they issued new equity in 4q2019 when their shares were at $28. On the other hand they are developing downtown Toronto condos which may not do as well in 2023 when they're finished.Its 50% of my account and if my other holding doesnt keep fking me in the ass it will be 150% of my portfolioLoblaws is a huge anchor for RioCan - they aren’t going anywhere. Shopper’s Drug Mart as well.

RioCan does also have Walmart’s at some locations - not quite as much as SmartCentres, though.

RioCan has a lot of the big name from all the different industries, so I wouldn’t be too worried about that. They also have a lot of the big banks.

Both are a good choice imo. I bought RioCan a few weeks ago. They’ve been able to maintain their 9.5% dividend, so that’s a big bonus.Riocan hands down, it's the best REIT in canada right now by FAR.

I wouldn't even touch any other reit when riocan is at $15Your account is not old enough

Going from 15 to 25 will beat any market return before including divvyYou sound like someone who got fked in the ass by riocan and you are here spreading bullshit to revenge your shittty tradeRioCan is a great company. 75% of their tenants are essential services. Most of small businesses are on deferral with support from the government. "Mr. Biden 2.0 dementia CEO" Ed Sonshine is planning to retire next year with Johnathan Gitlin replacing him. He got better experience than you and your family combined. While Gitlin takes over, Sonshine will guide him on being the board of director after he departs.

RioCan overall is a strong stable real estate that survive the recession without any cuts towards dividends. You are just throwing senseless information that proves nothing bad about this company and you are Trump 2.0 dementia if I may be wrong.Just wondering if you could source this info?Does Riocan currently allow drip on their shares?
I bought 200 shares of Riocan a few weeks ago, and I was told Rei.un is not eligible to set up a drip.  I’m with BMO InvestorLineI don't have any RioCan bro, I would never buy it with some of the other REIT that are on sale atm. Not gonna tell you which one is trading at an insanely low valuation, so you can stay poor holding your RioCan.REI.UN doesn't have their own DRIP. In this case my brokerage uses my distribution from REI.un to buy shares for me, no additional fees. 

For 200 shares I would get $24 in distributions a month and they will take $15ish for one extra share.Loool, so show me where riocan touched youWhich brokerage are you with?Redditor for 4 months, and majority of his posts are about CGX and REI.UN. Someone's got a bone to pickI'm with TD Direct Investing. 

I also have Investorline for my business but never tried DRIP. Ask them if you can do a synthetic DRIP.No I called BMO. They told me it’s not possible for me to get my 200 shares of rei.un on a drip. They had a link to a list of approved stocks they would do drips with and Riocan wasn’t on it sadly :(Prices wont hike. They're competing against cheap oil. Also, smart businesses will lower prices to scoop up market share while they can. China is loosing their manufacturing/production dominance with everyone being fed up with them. Ethiopia, Thailand, and Vietnam are scooping up textile/technological manufacturing from China at a blinding pace. This will be the most crucial turning point for the other international players.

All in all, with the current economic conditions in place, solar is a poor position to hold over the next 3 years. Green energy ETFs like PBD and QCLN are also in a bubble worse than the dotcom bubble.Where has your solar stocks input been hiding?? :)How about Enphase,  its has been doing absolutely phenomenal?When others dont hear their confirmation biases, they usually drown me in downvotes as their resolution to their problem.Are you concerned about the short sellers' allegations of fabricated revenue?Lol so we’re betting on a whether they hit something good in the hole? What are they gonna do with the land after too?Thanks zaddyWhat’s your position? 

Edit: BAN or postI'm betting that the people running this company know theres something good in the spot they're looking. They have the expertise.Ahh true! 889 sh @0.485I'm gay.This WEek WL

HIVEWhat do you guys think of PMED?Ive been glued to TSLA for so long that I keep reading TFSA as TSLA...Someone buy my stock please thank you...what are you sticking your dick in? We'd all love it if you'd share!JE because I hate money.I love how their financials that are in the negatives are in brackets... like all of the numbers except their dilution that feeds them their operation costs. 

Chart looks primed for growth. I'll have to watch it! thanks for the partial lead.What does this mean to the avg. investor?Looks like prem watsa on the move.Prem Watsa recovering losses by milking BB, while regular investors are crying in the shower after looking at TSX vs BB growth since new CEO brought by Watsa joined the company.Means your investments are safe for few more years.Price target $72-73Wow what a call. Teach me your wisdom.Very nice work. I am Leary of the advanced money destroyer thoughWhat's the timeline for this price target? Thank you!End of month hahaFast answer -No, AD doesn’t have VWAP. 

If you want to confirm for yourself, click the gear button on the right hand of the chart and you’ll see there’s no option for itEric Sprott (Canada's billionaire golden boy) also added some juicy ducats to [SVE (Silver One)](https://www.silverone.com/news/2020/silver-one-closes-oversubscribed-financing-of-9.5-million/) after buying in on it a few times before. It's almost as if he knew it'd happen. Get juicy deets like that and more and on the discord.I lurk on the discord but most of the people on there are self absorbed paper tradersGotta be at least a little self absorbed to smash those buttons just right XDI didn't come here to be personally attacked. If there is darkness, be the lightI didn’t mean it as a personal attack, apologies. /s ; )Open a usd tfsaWhy don’t you open up a USD side to the account? Just call into the trade desk and they’ll do it for you, makes it much easier

Edit- call the trade desk to open up the USD accountIt should be in the currency of whatever the stock is in. So if its in CAD the limit price will be in CAD, and the same with USD. Dont quote me on that, however. I trade with Questrade, and thats how they do it.I would go interactive brokers insteadIsnt there a ton of tax law shit that goes into this come filing season?That's how mine works and I use TDThank you!No you don’t do anything IRS related and if your fund is within your tfsa/rrsp then you don’t have anything tax related to doi believe the rules for tfsa and rrsp are different. i believe you will get taxed for a tfsaWell fuck my tits and call me shirley15% on US equities is taxed when you sell in your tsfa.You’re thinking about dividends. Dividends have withholding tax in a tfsa (30%) but they don’t have it in an rrsp. It’s withheld at the source so you still don’t have to do anything with the irsThank you, will open a usd TFSA account.  Have usd regular account for us OTC stocks not tradeable in registerd accounts.  
Appreciate the time it took all to reply as I learned a lot from the comment thread.  Look forward to becoming more involved in this communityok makes senseYou're not alone - opposite scenario happened to me today. Tried to buy a TSX listed equity and received the US OTC-listed version. TD platform has been pretty shit the last few months in general, i.e. unable to transfer securities or cash between accounts.I've done this a couple times by mistake because I didn't notice that I bought it in the wrong account (my mistake). Both times I've called them up immediately and they corrected the purchase.  

It may or may not be too late for you but I'd call them anyway and see if they can make the switch for you.That's brutal, I appreciate your reply, I'm just saddened by it's content lol. Was hoping it was something I was doing wrong.

I was completely unable to partake in after hours as well, whereas with previous US stuff I had sold after hours.

I apologize for your OTC US stock, that's so frustrating, get gouged on an unnecessary exchange for currency as well as a probably more illiquid version of what you bought.

I guess I'll just hope what I bought doesn't drop like a rock at open tomorrow 🤦‍♂️

EDIT : Am dumb as TSX doesn't do Premarket and post market? F, RIPThanks for the reply! I dug into it and gave them a shout as you suggested.

So to give a bit of an elaborate response in case anyone comes across this thread in the future;

My account is a Canadian TFSA and because there was an American and Canadian Ticker for this stock it bought the US version but converted to hold it in CAD. My issue with this was obviously the TSX doesn't allow any kind of premarket/aftermarket anywhere near as rich as the NASDAQ. However, when you call them, they can Journal it for you and have it converted to the American version and create a Sell/Buy order for you with the American one, then there's some messy settling but it works and I was able to get out premarket as I hoped.

Thanks again everyone!Cannabis stocks are NOT a buySorry though the Canadian sales volume (based on tax revenue) of legal weed are a tiny tiny fraction of the black market.  I don't see any immediate growth for any weed stock.So the fact that they have huge market growth potential doesn't seem promising? The month on month sales growth also seems promising. For me It was when I noticed most casual stoners I know switched to the stores recently. And it's only been what, a year and a half? This sector is in its infancy. And I don't even have a store near me in downtown Toronto.  There's so so so much more room to sell more weed. What other sector has that much untapped markets? I'd happily invest there then. What am I missing?So the issue really is 2 things.  Retail is inferior to black market, and has a reputation for being so the past year or more.  The other is the black market is pricing better quality weed (shipped) for what like half of what OCS is selling it for?  Why would you buy retail, unless you're in a rush and need a pre-rolled joint, when  you can just order online.  Canada clearly doesn't care about the missing revenue or this would stop tomorrow with strict enforcement and fines for black market goods.

Oh and a third thing just for laughs, you can grow more than you can smoke, legally, in your yard.  It's a weed at the end of the day, yes some are fussy but you can grow your own and save a ton.  Hell I know people who just sell or give away what they can't smoke.

Now please tell me how there is an untapped market for 2x priced retail w/ tax.Totally support this. I also am looking at smaller town Ontario, with older (boomers) folks. They're not going to have an ability to order and get weed delivered. They'll go into town for a booze run, and pick up some weed on the way. Look at the LCBO count in smaller towns. Huge amount for such a small population. If they slowly get into it, more than they already are, the retail shops space will grow. BM Dealers will slowly dissipate, allowing more demand for legal market. Plus all that BM stuff can get laced. People are currently lacing their stuff with fentanyl, etc. Those old boomers with retirement monry will want someone to talk to and have it regulated. They have lower risk tolerance than some teens trying to smoke out of a pop can behind their parent's garageI don't think it will be 2x priced for long.    I think the quality will increase and I think it takes more than a year or 2 to break people's black market habits.  As a grower I can near guarantee everyone won't be growing their own grade a weed to replace buying it. That shit takes time/effort that most people just aren't that interested in. Gardening isn't for everyone. Anecdotal but i used to buy from moms until I started growing at legalization. I've temporarily taken a break from growing and can't be arsed to order online when I can drop by the beer store/pot store next to each other on the way home from work.  Fair enough if you disagree but what other sector has a black market that big to potentially capture. I'd imagine there will be less new high school dealers or dealers in general deciding to start selling weed with legalization. And maybe mom's will slowly move to the legal side who knows what the future holds.I honestly don't get the hate this sector gets. It's Canada ffs near everyone smokes. And in 10 years most will smoke legallySo are you a reporter or a trader? What’s your position.Investor more than trader, don’t have enough capital to make the quick money per say, but the company itself has set itself up pretty well for the pandemic and subsequently post pandemic world....so you're a reporter. Also, try hitting reply.Hard passLmftfy: Bbd.b
