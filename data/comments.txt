Edit: for more clarification, I spend non-market hours on a b i t c o i n gambling site and just lost in roulette 3 times in a row and laughed instead of crying. I keep telling myself “no more” and then deposit more money later in the night. I need serious help.Sometimes I just wish I could hit a 10-bagger, break even, and go back to my naive and happy life before ever discovering optionsHey, my brothers.  If you feel really bad right now, please read this.  Everything will be alright.  You are priceless and mistakes happen.  They may happen many times.  It's okay.

This week is over.  The weekend is here.  Take your lessons and learn from them.

If you feel addicted, sad, depressed, lonely, hopeless, etc. please tell someone.  You are loved.  If you need someone, send me a chat message.  I have all of the time in the world for you.Even if you lose money boys. If you are healthy you are so lucky. I would give away all my money to be normal again. No questions asked.

Lesson: It is still gambling.Lol republicans know they'd have NO chance in November if they went against the $1200 paymentsAlright guys it was a good 4 months lost my entire savings over $45k and officially deleting Robinhood for a few months to get my shit together but ill be back!Anyone else retarded enough to hold their Monday calls over the weekend or is that just meIf you ever feel bad about your trading decisions or financial situation, relax, breathe and remember Bridgwater Associates just laid off people with +15yr of experience via Zoom meetings.I'm back boys. Started with $35 today ended at $150. One step at a timeIf you bought INTC shares today, went back in time to the year 2000 and sold, you would've made moneyImagine betting half of your net worth on roulette and having to wait three days to see if you won or not.My new favorite activity, here's what you do:

1. Make silly mistakes trading, but get bailed out by JPow and pure luck
2. Cultivate a list of rules you will follow going forward so that those silly mistakes don't happen again
3. Start getting behind on a trade that has months until expiry
4. Abandon all rules, buy FDs and plays in the opposite direction of your initial play (that instantly reverse)
5. Sell out of those plays at a loss, burn day trades, and be left with a smaller stack to average down with than you had in the first place
6. Come to WSB and try to get you all to make me feel better about my plays and subsequently be called a retard
7. Pray to JPow and the tendie gods
8. RepeatAttention new people talking about dix/gex.. that shit is comically fake and the people who used to talk about it are all wiped outI used to be a trader like you, before I fomo'd into tsla(Inb4, yes ik this a wendy's) 

My weekend game plan is to doing the necessary reading, studying as if I were in college again to become a better options trader. 

Doing research looking up possibly good plays for august/sept with a few leaps for october or later. Going to try my best next week to not be a sheep following the herd here buying into whatever hype is being discuss and thinking more independently and only sharing my plays if I deem it to be a good one for the long term. 

Being down 75% all time hurts and makes me want to quit trading but like some dude messaged me saying "don't quit at the bottom" so I'm not giving up. Not yet. I turned $600 to $9k in june before losing it all buying only naked calls, and then turned whatever was left ($750 to 13K between june 26th - july 10th) on pretty much Tesla, AMZN, FB, PYPL, Fastly and a couple other tech stock options. 

tl;dr , its been a shitty month but I'm not giving up just yet. back to the lab to come up with a solid game plan for august to make these tendies back and keep this time. 100K by December and Lambo soon.

I know why you're here, autist. I know what you've been doing... why you hardly sleep, why you live alone, and why night after night, you sit by your computer. You're looking for tendies. I know because I was once looking for the same thing. And when I found tendies, I realized I wasn't really looking for tendies. I was looking for an answer. It's the question that drives us, autist. It's the question that brought you here. You know the question, just as I did.

I'm happy to just listen, too.Did anyone actually make money this weekOne time I was at a bar with a group of buddies and we started talking to some chicks. One of the chicks was a fatty and we're just chatting and I order another beer for me and she takes that opportunity to tell the bartender, "one for me too". The bartender bro looks at me and says are you paying for both -- I look at the fat chick, she looks at me -- I look back at the bartender and he has a smile on his face cuz he knows whats up -- Obviously I say "nah, I'm good". Fat chick looked upset and had to pay for her own drink.

Moral of the story - I ain't gonna be pressured into paying for a fat chick's drink and I'm certainly not going to be pressured into buying dips by you autists.AMD is going to fuck up their earnings and it will swap prices with INTCAUY 👀What you just witnessed this week was a flight to safety.http://www.gamblersanonymous.orgWas math invented or discovered??If we don't hit breakers by this time next week, I will lick the bottom of a dumpster.

Second is that I actually have the capital to sell options instead of buying them. Those things make all the difference.I told you _____ was going to _______! Nobody listened.

Can you believe it’s 2020 and people still think you’re allowed to lie on Internet forums?30 Million Americans just lost their UI Lifeline. Gun sales at historic record. Let the games begin.This is indicative of nothing, but the last time we had two red days, the third day was June 11Well Sam just smashed the shit outta earnings my god the growth since MarchListen. AMD is going to 75 next week. If it doesn’t, I cry 😢 and we can’t have that, can we?Imma be honest we need some real red days. This weekend chat isn’t the same without bear doom and gloom “Many will be fucked”.We keep saying we’d buy TSLA shares when it falls below $1k....but would we? I feel like I’d pussy out AGAIN.this rally will be known as the SPAC spike (DKNG, NKLA, SPCE, NET & so many more)Anyone still play SPY? 

Lost way too much money to the spymanI had puts these last two days, but eod switched back to chad and am pretty much all in on 7/31 AAPL and AMZN calls 🚀

Tbh idk how some of you can be holding puts over the weekend and not be shitting yourself. Like I don’t feel greeeeat about my calls but it’s likely gonna work out bc of earnings and manipulated pumps. With puts though, you’re just gonna get fucked so often even when you’re right about the direction they’ll find a way to fuck you lolBear thinking

1. FEDS increasing interest rates
2. Stimulus won't pass
3. Earnings will bring down the market
4. Covid Deaths increasing

not going to lie... this sounds very familiar.

 I'm ready to switch to bear gang. but that's not till we break Spy 300 and 290.I hereby declare that it's time to change the WSB banner for our saviour, Saint Jerome Powell the Third, has abandoned us loyal autists during these trying times.Let’s open 300 Monday on fear of no stimulus and loss of UI benefitsso I was lied to... Mr. Beast didn't yolo 100k did he! and the market didnt crash :( RIPHad my best week in a looong time. Deposited 400 in my account last Friday. Turned that into 1600 (Spy, BABA, Uber). Pulled 1200 out to put back into my savings. And now I am only down 4k all time.With all the money I lost I could of purchased one of those weird looking green egg grills and a shit ton of steaks for my entire neighborhood oh and hot dogs for the kids[apparently the US just "legally invaded China"](https://twitter.com/breaking911/status/1286793921788616705?s=21)When do you cut losses on your option calls? Certain % down or other methodAUY 8/21c $7 or $7.5. Gold and Silver through the stratosphereGetting cucked by Elon again already and it's not even Monday yetSeriously tho... if it doesn't pump on Monday the bull run may be over, RIP to my callsDid I understand correctly that the US Government broke down the door to the Chinese Embassy today?So aliens bullish or bearish?Someone teach me how to take profits. I’m full tardPeople were scared today so you know what I did? Loaded up with calls on big oil and petroleumit's a Golden Monkey night 🍻At what point does USD sinking become a problem?Damn this sub is super bearish right right now. I guess we'll be seeing a bigly green week coming up.

When was the last time the dip didn't get bought up?Have a good weekendWhite Claw needs to IPO nowDaily reminder that the Weekend Dow is worthless and is traded by 3 people.Imagine being a Japanese citizen and thinking the Nikkei will ever make a comeback. That must be so demoralizingJust ate a huge edible. 

🚀🚀🚀🚀   ➡️   ✨🪐🌏💫Sipping on my Friday evening Cranberry KombuchaWait you guys actually have lives and dont spend about 4 hours a day on this? Oh shit ://Bought tech stocks on discount without realizing I could have bought QQQ calls on a discount for next week.I told a drug addict that he could leave his van at my house, but he cant sleep in it. He said hes not sleeping in it and is waiting on his ride and staying some place else. Its been 6 hours of it sitting in my yard running with him inside. What should I do, I fucking hate people.Imagine sitting at home all day playing Animal Crossing instead of lighting your money on fire this week.States are gonna be announcing full shutdowns this weekend. Mitch gonna end up just passing Pelosi's HEROES Act by lunch on Monday out of total panic. SPY 380 eow.u/CptTonyStark is doing alright :)

Thanks to those who asked about him.  Doing the best I can to love him like my own brother.>“Another government stimulus package is not in the best interests of the people.” -Elon Musk

Dude, how much of the last stimulus was pissed away on TSLA stock?Holy fuck, Sam adams makes Truly? If I knew that I would have been balls deep on SAMMy fellow bulls -

This week was not what we were expecting. Our fellow ally JPow has not printed or assisted us in this theatre of combat, but in times like these I ask for us to come together as one. Come Monday, this is our D-Day. I refuse to let these bears strike fear upon us. So what? We have two bad days? Fuck ‘em.

This battle for the week of 7/31 is all that is left brothers. Many of our calls will fall, and few will prevail with earnings. Let us pray as this is our fortnight, for we prepare to sacrifice our livelihoods to provide for those we love.

Godspeed my fellow Bulls. I shall see you on the battlefield.I'm holding 15G's of QQQ callls over this weekend. Decided life needed some spiceI can’t do online school any more man I’m so burnt out. Low key hoping for a revolution so that none of this shit matters any more.I played like a Grade A moron today and definitely deserve to lose everything.Anyone else happy watching NKLA plummet?  

Their CEO is a WMT version of ElonOPEN UP THE WEEKEND DOW.


IM BORED 😡Put on your tinfoil hats and gather around retards.  Just like we all have an FBI agent watching us (hi friend) we all have an MM that watches us and makes plays to steal our trendies. Not all of them are smart but over time they seem to be pretty consistent at doing this. I have confirmed my bias today because my MM closed my account out for the week at an even 34k. No other reasonable explanation other than my MM fucking with me.

Nothing major so far. Balance sheet is up $6BN due to FX swaplines shrink and mortgage backed securities and US Treasury Market purchases increase. Other credit facilities growing at a steady pace. No repo operations last week.

Mortgage backed securities are showing a bit anomaly though.You cant make this shit up even if you wanted to

I sure hope so or else I just pissed away a few thousand dollars.i love weekend because my money is safe from meI know everyone likes the stimulus checks, but I’m hating the idea of giving them out willy nearly to many of the ungrateful fucks. Plenty of anti maskers perpetuating the current problem, preaching socialism is bad, but also feeling entitled to more gov checks.

SPY $420 8/7I had 40 7/31 36C DKNG calls

Sold them for a 25% profit.

Took that profit for and bought TSLA FDs which ended at 0. Honestly the idea wasn’t bad just the timing was. If I waited until it hit 1440-1450 again I’d probably have doubled.

Then rebought 35 7/31 DKNG 37Cs which are up 25% as well.

Usually not a believer but was able to use to sell spreads on my puts anytime we dipped below 320 to lock in some gains.

First, let's start with Fed purchase of mortgage backed securities:

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WSHOMCB](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WSHOMCB)

After May 6, the Fed's purchases of mortgage backed securities skyrocketed and still continues.

On July 13, the New York Fed [published a list of asset-backed loans ](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/markets/TALF/loan-rate-benchmark/TALF-ABS-Eligibility-Determination.pdf)that it had approved for eligibility in one of its emergency lending  programs, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, otherwise known as TALF. Based on this list, we can say that JP Morgan has a lot of exposure on mortgage backed securities to a point that Fed needs to back them up. (not a good sign)

According to [its newly released transaction data for TALF](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/mlf-ppplf-pdcf-mmlf-cpff-pmccf-smccf-talf-7-10-20.pdf), it has made a total of $252 million in loans thus far – the vast majority of which involved commercial real estate loans issued by the biggest Wall Street banks at some point over the past seven years. In the report, Fed says:

>As described in the Board’s initial report to Congress regarding the TALF, the TALF includes features that are intended to mitigate risk to the Federal Reserve. The Board continues to expect that the TALF will not result in losses to the Federal Reserve.

TALF loans are currently set to mature on June 26, 2023 – which means that one would need an outlook that shows the U.S. recovering from the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression in a period of three years, not possible until a miracle happens. TALF will most likely result in losses in the near future.Shoulda gone all in to DKNG today. Ads all fucking over these NBA games.Accidentally made three day trades on ToS and got PDT flagged, so I sent them a message saying it was an honest mistake and the support guy said no problem, we'll lift it but you need to promise not do it again.

July only has a week left....If youre trading just based on charts, Intel is the better trade now. I went balls deep with 37.5C 1/22 today @ 50.20. That was a no brainer.

After two red days (and bouncing off 320 a few times), it seems braindead obvious to go all-in on calls. Which I think might be the problem.Surely the $10 drop INTC had will surely correct itself by Monday ^Right?

Intel, TSMC, and Samsung are the only 3 top-shelf fabs in the world. And Intel is already lagging.
China will swoop into Taiwan and cut off America at the drop of a hat. It's a massive gaping national security risk and Intel is all we have domestically. Samsung is cool but it ain't domestic.

Maybe not now, but Intel is gonna skyrocket when the government starts giving it short-term multi billion dollar contracts for new fabs.Intel calls?

I did not sell when it hit $4500, or set a stop loss for some reason, mostly because the big spreads and I would of had to set it so low to not get stopped by the second to second swings.  Did not sell on the second pump near end of day when it briefly hit 1450 again, expired worthless.  Really beating myself up over this, obviously made a ton of mistakes.  Don't know what came over me, greed I guess.For some reason I used conservative strategies in my paper account and do yolos with my real money accountImagine not buying calls. Green Monday.

TRULY FIST ON CHEST NO FEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  NO FEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!If congress doesn't extend just the 600 then I think we will be trading sideways and have some major red days. Republicans seem hell-bent on not extending the 600. That extra 600 gives extra purchasing power, and even to those who are making off more from UI are probably buying things and so money is going back into the economy. 

I just don't see us having any crazy green days without something being passed. We probably will need to dump super hard for us to get a bill. So all call holders get fucked.So many memes occurred.

TSLA - 2000

AAPL - 400

AMZN - 3500

MSFT - 230

AMD - 70

We have reached the top boys.Nasdaq will have a massive rally on Monday.i think its a lot easier for newbies to make money than veterans. cause people who've been in the market for a long time have developed biases. for example AMD went up 16% in a single day today. anyone who's been following AMD for a while now knows its a meme stock, but I dont think anyone who's been following AMD for a long time would've thought it'd go up any more than maybe like 8% today on intel earnings. And shit like TSLA. Newbies see it going up 10% or down 10% every day, but WSBers from late 2019 have seen TSLA trading flat and staying at 350, so they cant even fathom TSLA being at 1500. However, on the other side, you have newbies, who dont have biases in the market. So they're willing to throw money at random shit, and a lot of the time it works. Probably why they call it beginners luck. Veterans are more seasoned, but precisely because they're more seasoned that they miss out on the biggest opportunities because they're too scared to go in. Whereas newbies just charge in blindly because they dont know any better. And it works because theres so many newbies charging in that at least one of them is bound to strike gold. Same reason why people who lived through the dotcom bubble and the financial crisis like buffett are too scared to buy into the market, whereas newer fund managers and newbies are making a fucking killing cause they have no idea what its like to get fucked in an instant until they doHow much do we gap up Sunday open?Have a good weekend kings and queens

Come Monday, we prepare for the greatest challenge of our lives.

We are the 300 Spartans, staring down a sea of bears. I reckon the odds may not swing in our favor, but I've been both a bull and a bear and I choose to die a bull everyday of the fucking week.

GODSPEED.Just emailed Robinhood and asked them if I could get paper copies of all my options certificates so I can wallpaper my house. Will report backStill think TSLA got done dirty this week. Is it overvalued? Probably. 

Just crazy to see it $400 less than it’s peak during the ER run up, after ER was a huge beat. 

Haters can think what they want, name me another company that has the potential to pioneer multiple industries more than TSLA. It’s more than just EV car sales numbers.

Thanks for the fuel, bears. 🚀Prayer circle for AMD put gang ✋Next week will finish red too and we might get our first red monday open in a while. Reposting this for everyone to see as a reminder: 

Weekend Thread bears starter pack:

\-Sharing new case numbers on hourly basis.

\-Sharing quotes and interviews from Fauci.

\-Jerking off to Weekend Dow being down -0.2%.

\-Saying "imagine holding calls over the weekend"

\-Sharing news articles spreading doom and gloom.

\-Calling for rug pull on Monday. Saying that top is in.

\-Saying what they will be buying when their puts print.How do we find out if a company's executives are selling their shares.  Novavax exc.  need to be watched like a hawk.usually don’t beat myself up over bad trades but selling my AMD 60c 7/24s for a loss on Monday was the dumbest fucking move I’ve made to-date. I was vaccinated as a child and I’m going to get 15 Covid shots straight to the dome. Completely retarded.Dix low at 42 and Gex lower again to 1.2B. Someone will be bigly fuck next week.Today is the first green day I had in the last two weeks. Feels good.Spending this weekend spending myself into debt, because I know in my heart $AUY will print next week.I was surprised by what TD Ameritrade just told me. Or maybe I heard wrong and someone can correct me:

You aren't held to the day trade restriction (3 round trips within 5 days) if you stay away from a margin account and just have a cash account, regardless of being below the $25K total equity.

The only down side is that you do have to wait a day for options to clear and have those funds available, so maybe it is a wash anyway since you would only be able to trade using cash that hadn't been used that day and after you've made several round trips you will not have any more cash to use that day.OooOOOo looky weekend time....time for bears to come out and play only before getting their cheeks clapped on Monday by some sort of hopes or optimism.... 
And before you say bears feasted all week, there is nothing bearish about being 5% down from the height of this over-inflated lipstick covered pig of a market.Bit worried about amazon next week"Diversification" he says as distributes his money across various shit sectors that completely cuck his gains, not realising his entire money is in the US markets. You're supposed to diversify across different economies, not sectors in the same country.Next week NQ sub 10k for sureI feel like if tens of millions get evicted we might see some violent riotsAll the Newbie Yahoos better get their last minute YOLOs in now. The game is over now since administration not budging on $600 weekly UI Bonus money. Predicting catastrophic drop from support disappearing overnight.Man sometimes i just feel so low. Feel like im stuck and life doesnt ever improve, every day is the same shit, feel like my life is just wasting away. Stock market is the only thing that makes feel alivewhy isnt there more people talking about AMD puts. It looks like free money lol

Create a stock exchange where you can sell shares of YOURSELF. Since corporations are treated like humans according to the law, we should be able to sell shares of actual people as well.

One big problem is that the lifespan of a human is finite vs. a corporation. Therefore, for shares to actually mean anything, 10% of your annual income will need to be paid out as dividends every year.

A 24 year old law student in Hardvard will be like TSLA. A janitor in McD working on his acting career is like a penny stock.

Any thoughts??AOC is baePissed I left about 4K on the table this week by not getting out of my positions early enough.

I think we’ll pump next weekWFC all inMy portfolio of SPX strangles, with long dates OTM GLD calls as a hedge for dollar collapse, did very well this week.

Got a call for a bounce. Too good to passDRV (bear real estate etf) and FAZ(bank bear etf) park a lil money in there whatever your willing to lose. But it generally lives in a 12-15 range.

I’m trying to figure out how to take advantage of big dips when you want to enter into a long positon, but don’t want to get in too early. 

Could you buy a short term put to ride momentum, and at the same time a long term call for when it reverses? You could ride the put down for max tendies, and then sell it when it starts to level out, and then ride the call back up?

Does this have a name? Is this a completely dumb approach?

I did this when entering Apple yesterday, and the puts paid off big today. Like an idiot I sold both sides (calls and puts), and then rebought my calls later for about what I sold them for. I don’t know why I sold both legs, should have just sold the puts.I'm going to create a change.org position to have MU declassified as a tech stock.

Need a smart far out playBecause Netflix showed poor guidance moving forward, and everyone knows the entire economy is driven by Netflix subscriber growth.Stimulus package progressing slowly, this morning’s FED operations were short lived and didn’t have much lasting power, and the DXY approaching lows of 2018 are the obvious bearish signals.

Potential future bearish signals include the upcoming high numbers of evictions which if they come true spell for more riots. Potential for trade war with China over the recent Chinese nationals arrested + South China Sea tensions. Earnings coming in more grim as Texas, California, and Florida become the new Covid Hotspots, that could put a damper on some Q3 guidances/projections too. If Trump really does go through with his price fixing pharma executive order, and it really has teeth, then pharma is going to dump.

Losing hurts many times more than winning.Those are people who have been taught that your worth as a person is directly linked with the amount of money you have. Therefore if they have a negative amount of money they start to believe they're less than worthless.  


I've been in debt and on food stamps for most of my 17 years of adult life. So many people out there who would just choose to off themselves if they were me. It's dumb.Depends on how they got that 500k, what if it was inheritance? But the answer to your question, in general, is mental health.Mental health as already stated, possibly drugs. 500k to 100k is one thing but try going from 500k to broke. Not saying it’s something to kill yourself over but I imagine I’d go into a pretty deep depression.People freak the fuck out and panic, especially if they have underlying mental health issues.Probably most difficult when you're fairly new and not used to it. Once you've been in the market a while and especially trading options you are used to these kinda swings.I'm a stable person with a decent sized portfolio and I felt like shit yesterday going down 5%, 60% of that in realized losses not equity. I can imagine being younger, more immature, and less stable and putting my portfolio on that fd instead of 4k and losing everything being a lot worst feelingNothing is the end of the world, but if you are going from 500k to 0 as evidence that you are an irredeemable fuckup, you might feel like it’s better to end it.

You can only claim $3k per year in losses but the rest carries over. If you use Robinhood and TurboTax you can auto import everything pretty easy.If you've never filed your taxes, you may as well go to a professional. This would not be the year to start lol. Also, read up on wash-sales. You may not be able to write off all 9k if all your losses are considered wash sales...

In short, if you sell a position at a loss and buy back into a similar position within 30 days, you can no longer write off the initial loss. That's the essence but it's a bit more complicated, thus a tax professional needed.It's super easy you tell your CPAGod I would nutbeen like that for the past 2 weeks but it's so hard to just sit out lolWish I could go back in time.Onboard, except with 9/18s and LEAPsOn the share train, 60 would be great, but I'll settle for 55. u/BluntsVideoDump is clueless.We’re not hitting 60, but 53 or 54 is possible."Hey so we made a profit and beat revenue a little bit!

Might dip lowerr first if markets start falling.Gonna be a massive pump MondayThat kid has a very punchable faceWaPo and CNN got got.There are so many ways to get rich in this world!!damn that's wild you can yell random shit at me for quarter bilhe sued for a quarter billion, probably settled for 10 bucksMillion*Lol he didn't get 250m, that's not how settling works.That’s crazy. Set for life now.Yea. If there was gonna be another trillion dollar company id say walmart is in the best position to make it happen. I wouldbsay tsla but they dont make enough moneyYeah, but Walmart's online UI sucks balls. Besides, you can't get anything even remotely specialized from Walmart. They can't be beat for high volume items, but if you want something that's not a lowest common denominator good, Amazon has you covered. 

It's almost like they're in different sections of the consumer goods space. Walmart is a fucking warehouse of whatever generic shit you want and it's right next door, but if you want something even slightly non-standard they don't carry it. They can't. 

I don't actually see them as being in as much competition as many people do. When you want a 12 pack of toilet paper, a carton of eggs, and a shit tier Chinese made hammer, Walmart is just down the road (or delivers same day, lol). When you want a roll of kangaroo leather, an iPad Pro, and a Ron Jeremy themed fishing lure, that's Amazon territory.I have Amazon prime, I can get literally any product sent to my door in 1-2 days, free shipping, plus streaming movies, ebooks and other random shit. I also have a costco membership to save on bulk stuff. I won't buy another membership for no extra benefit. It doesn't matter if Walmart is close. If I need something from there I'll just go.10 miles is 16.09 kmSPY rouletteSame here but with AAPL and SNAP lmfaoAaanndd it's gonebut why do you think it would go back to that?Damn, that’s a good point and one that we should all forget and get the market back to ATHsWHAT HAPPENS NEXTLook at Mr. Stamina here, lasting a whole 3 seconds.

Now we’ve got j pow communismLOL u think those tesla calls are going to have a good weekend?Lol get reckt bro!what did you start atCongrats and fuck youPeople in here are the 1% that feel the need to communicate. The extremes.. like myself, hehe.Famous last words.Solid DDI'm so deep in SLV, AG, and GDX manThe past is the past, learn from mistakes. Document them. Keep positive.Winning strategy right hereI stayed out all week and then played Tesla and fucked up my clean record. FuriousSomething something falling knife, INTC and shit. SPY will probably moon Monday.What's your plan for the weekend?“Literally can’t go tits up” is the basis for my entire worldview. If that’s a lie then...I’d be shambled.Lmao if they haven't been saving it then that's on them. They were being paid more than they were making originallyNo no that’s next week rightDidn’t we have like 4 red days following TSLA’s dump after 1780? That entire week was the big gay.Thought about this but then got worried my puts expiring next week would get screwed by a stimulus pump.No, it wasn’t, the second of the three was 11th, the third was June 12...Fuckin Seltzer shit

We shouodve known this :(Seems like you already are crying?Next week is going to be a mixed bag of volatility but lots of red is on the way don't worry.I’ll buy at $250SPACs and EVs. Is it a coincedence that when we combined them into SPAQ, everything started going to shit?NET was a Spac?i keep coming back to VXX after he fucks me up every other dayUsually ODTE spy puts if I’m feeling itI play SPY 90% of all my tradesSpy theta fuck or dumpI'm up more then I'm down, but it's never a fun rideEarnings next week.

Won’t last forever but the past month it has been super relaxing holding themUh you said it right there "they'll find a way to fuck you" lolYou buy both you tard. Puts or Vix calls as a hedge. Not a fuckload of them but enough that if a big red day comes in, they’ll more than make up for the difference my calls and stonks lost in value.At current market prices, bears only need any one of those four to happen in order to win.SPX/ SPY 150-MA is the best bull bear designatorLmaoI hate that guy so much for being so successful in his algorithm exploits. Blows my mind you can acquire such wealth with simple, creative YouTube content. Very punchable face, not sure of his talents besides his genius in exploiting views.If he did, he’s probably reading your comment on a recording right now and saying, “what an asshole.”I lost $6k

Could have got a 1980 SL convertible to drive around 5 times a yearI could have bought a new motorcycle from these last 2 days alone.  
Don't need another one, but I wouldn't say no to one either.That’s not any fun though.Yeah, but you wouldn’t have had thousands of retards to argue with about brrrri need this shit to calm downChina is here, Mr. Burton 

What does that even mean, China is here?This pleases my puts.It's OK. We sprinkled some American dirt on it first, so it's our territory now.Usually at -98% I can usually get a couple dollars for a drink at Starbucks.What's a loss?I've decided to do it at 30-50%, did it this week.Mix of % and time left and evaluating opportunity costIf you wouldn’t buy the option then you should sell it. Consider if it’s still a good play and disregard past losses.I'll use option profit calculator, and then draw a line from current stock price to the ending break even stock price point on like a 1h chart of the underlying. If it looks possible, my stubborn ass holds and loses. But when you can just see that there's no fucking way, find an exit point.

That said, I ignored the rule with AMD this week and got saved by a miracle. But that's like 1/1000Buyers are definitely getting lower in numbers but it's not over yetLink or it didn’t happen[Consulate, not embassy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consular_immunity).  The link describes the slightly lesser protections for consulates.  In particular, there is no immunity for those under consular protection if they are accused of certain crimes.  The Gyna consulate in Houston was operating an organized spy ring at local research universities and that is a definite no-no.

The action follows Chinese insistence on searching US diplomatic bag recently when US State officials returned to the closed US consulate in Wuhan to retrieve those items.  Searching diplomatic bag is tantamount to an act of war, so this retaliation isn't unexpected.Bullish , intergalactic exchanges babyProbably bullish if they haven't killed us yetplace a limit sell on an optimistic exit. like, as soon as your buy fills, turn around and limit it sell it for 25%/50% profit.

The Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider should start going to work in the next few years and there’s speculation that the B-2 was developed using ET technology so maybe keep an eye on aeronautics agencies.

As far as politics are concerned the UN is (I think) the only world power with a division explicitly dedicated to exo-politics. I don’t know what could be made out of that but if the US keeps pissing the UN off then they may would cut us out of some deals seeing ET as the bigger player.Bullish on FLIR, that’s what they’re being filmed on.3 days and we have a trend, I don’t think Donnie would like thatStoically reflecting on the impending massacre that will descend upon the bulls.This needs to be the official bear bannerfun fact black bear populations are growing, grizzlies are stable and polar are decliningyou wont but god bless youyoure gona be rich relax

Tesla pulled $400m worth of regulatory credits from the EU forward to sell and sold FSD tech that Elon himself said needs to be redone to make a GAAP profit this quarter.But when TSLA is up 50% for no real reason...it makes total sense, right? 🤣"Positive"Figuring intel went down 16% does it really make intel look like nothingIt's TSLA, moving it what it *does*. The *only* play on TSLA is a strangle. It's literally free money.Hard to say. As long as the government extended unemployment benefits it might have been okay. Probably way more bankruptcies, but then companies would understand the moral hazards of spending all of their cash on hand buying stocks and taking on huge amounts of debt.  

The fed helped the market, but did extremely little to help the citizen.Owners of capital would have been fucked, but otherwise still the same shit.

So this was just to bailout people who own stocks, bonds, etc. People are never the goal.Long long term way better. A more stable economy, a more equal and fair society, etc. But in the long long term we’re all dead. 

Who knows how long it would take to recover from scratch? Rebuild consumer confidence? 5 years, 10 years, or even longer? Think about all the opportunities that vanish, all the careers destroyed, all the years of life gone. 

So we put off the reckoning for as long as we can. Everyone knows the current trajectory isn’t stable or sustainable, yet we continue on and kick the can down the road. Let the next generation deal with it.I was wondering the success rate of those DD threads earlier 😅

The type of DD I want to see is someone saying, “I work for SAM... we killed it. Buy all the calls you can afford. I will delete this in 5 minutes.” I don’t think that’s too much to ask.Good luck.

Bought in yesterday before the big slide.I think the yearly liquidity bottleneck in October is going to be interesting. It's also worth keeping in mind that a crash into the election is a preferrable outcome for Democrats. If they get to sweep in during a crisis and "fix things" it would look good (They don't need to try actively to wrech things for this to happen). September/October is also when a lot of the corporate stimulus runs out. Edit: crash into election win and then rebound is actually much preferrable to levitation into election win and then crash.Long term puts get destroyed even worse by either theta or pumpsWhat is the fed gonna do?

Plan to sell before noon or buy Monday options if you’re trying to scalp the option until Friday closeYou can call and have it removed I believe. Use to happen to me but told them nahhhh.Did you buy those using margin? They sometimes liquidate positions if you are doing extremely risky things, usually right before the market close.The auto sell happens sometimes and other times it doesn’t — I think they do it when you don’t have the cash position to cover any exercise.

You can always buy it back immediately and it won’t be liquidated again, but this has happened to me at unfavorable moments where moves happened after to shake out more retail.

https://youtu.be/A-tNkuYV4_QDepends on your date. Weeklies? Could make a quick flip short term in a sell the news situation even if they bring dick Or lose it all. Long term it’s going up. longer dated calls is the safe way. But if you want to gamble I see nothing wrong with your plan. Idiot for sure but can be an idiot with moneyWoah. This isn't a typical recession. It's a depression with wfh.Last earnings it tanked after based on shitty guidance, which I predict to be the same.MSFT was highest two days before earnings, so....Tuesday?Probably MondayToo cheap/poor, just going to wait the day of for FDs lolMonsterbear bloodPussyAdrenaline shock, 0 sugar and 300mg of caffeine. Plus it’s not like redline where it’s a 50/50 chance that there’s a chance you’ll get the runs or shit yourself mid lift.Red bull and rockstarFat lines followed by a glass of waterSame. wait decreased 1% actually lolBid/ask on options go wonky after close. Last night I had debit put spreads on AAPL. Was up 30% until close then showed I was down 50% right after the bell. Had a quick look and the short strikes were suddenly showing a mid-point higher than my long strikes. 

Could be something like that...Stimulus checks droppedGood luck. I bought 10 shares. 
I mean uh i bought 100 calls. Yeah. 17.5c and all that shitcalls? any others you eyeing?Good luck I got out with +5% lolBRK.A because i can sell it and buy all the stocks. what kind of question is this?SpaceX at IPOGoogleBerkshire AQQQAmazonMVIS - they're gonig to b e bought by microsoff and be worth $100 a shareWhatever Trevor Milton is running cause that guy can adapt to anything.

Kappa, GoogleMan that chart looks like amd before it broke 60! I’m in Monday! ThanksYou’re fucked. The $150 and $160 calls way too out of the money. I’ve got September $135s and I’m starting to doubt this garbage stock will get to even that by the then.It didn’t even move thoI hope you didn’t bet on Walmart+. It’ll do literally nothing.Y'all need to get on level 3Right here buddy. WMT is going to do well over the next month or so, I am very confident of that. We have the 2nd stimulus package coming in, which it seems almost definitely will include $1200 checks again based off of news from the hill/WH. That alone would be good for WMT, but it is also back to school season and WMT is expected to launch Walmart+ soon. I think that the timing of this second stimulus check will make for a very strong launch of that service. It's a one-time annual subscription payment, I might add.

Might want to those higher strikes early next week and purchase some with the same strike but further out expiries though. Two weeks is asking a little much for that much of a rally right now. But also keep in mind that earnings come out 8/14. Maybe aim for mid September or end of August.Why can't they just release planes that aren't shitty hazards?Because they were on saleNclh and RCL too- I hopped in this week, really think there's something to this notion that money is rotating out of tech and into value$25 haircut $5 resumes $50 new shirt $20 weekly bus pass, go get a jobFifth of whisky, rental boat with anchor and rope, CD player with linkin park.JNUGOh he high highIn a rather round about way I think that’s kind of what the dollar isI just found out if you cash out with lite coin you pay less transfer fees.

BCEKF, AG, EXK, JNUGYou definitely have callsNothing to worry about... until Monday anywayEarnings seem to be more or less priced in at this point. You'll probably have a good dip Monday to exit that put.Bullish on DE, BUD, CVX, DFS, PORTheta gang here mostly, CZR and DFS have about half my capital tied up, a bit in the cruise lines, and then some Sept bud calls down 60%.plus my spacs, but most of them are being little bitches this weekputs on NKLA MRNA WYNN QQQ SPY

AZN was my one good play.

agreed - i bought into RTX cuz i dunno why it's been down but forming higher highs. my dd is shit cuz i feel like it won't matter much cuz defense is gonna be ++ super long term. I wish i just bought the calls for LMT cuz i held half a share but felt too poor to purchase evne spreads.AZN call holders would like a word. lmaoSell half your contractsI sold mine a bit after open and then bought more during that dip at like 10:30am and sold those later in the day. Could’ve held my initial ones longer but the double dipping makes me feel better about it. The ones I sold early in the day I bought for around $200 and sold for 800$ each. Edit: they were at like 1k each later in the day but I double dipped so didn’t feel as badI like to wait for signs of flattening/reversal before I cut my winners.

Like IOUs?I'd be looking to sell the biotech some time in the next month or two and viewing the uranium as a year or so investment unless it explodes. Sell anything if it goes below the 150 day moving average and or dips on big volume. I don't know if I told you but generally it's a good idea to enter half the position and then add more shares if it pullback close to 150-day moving average, especially if it's on big volume. Btw if these investment fail, it happens. There's a new hot sector every other month and if your stop loss is 20-30% percent below the entry price you won't have lost that much, you'll just be reverse compounding.what if they beat both EPS and revenue bigly and raise full year guidance?NoAOL usersdouble RC-P90Proof?

Basically yeah, contracts more than a yearThey’re technically the contracts that trade for January that aren’t weeklies, but some people here use the term to mean anything longer than a few months.Nooo not yet!

Oh waitFuckkkkk that’s savageRIP the poor and non-white people.I stopped correlating the impending worldwide crisis with the market. It will get corrected at some point, but not when you expect it.I have applied to so many jobs and have been getting low balled by employers. It’s bullshit they just don’t want to give us an alternative. Economic times are hard we can offer you this much compensations and I’m suppose to take it.The only way out is inflated prices for inflated wages. People will complain too much if there’s more gig or low pay jobs. I reckon the government get brownie points for raising minimum wage then use the inflation to help pay off their debts.Some people are just going to have to accept that their 600/week stimulus is going to end sooner or later. Another approach, online learning or so can help them open up some doors to new opportunities that pay more. Possibly.Nothing in /r/Economics is "worth a read"Happy birthday!Happy Birthday fam!You want a cookie?

Don’t get fooled by the amd hype either ok 

U sound like a stupid noob laughing at a blue chip that is over sold 

Big cocks like me love to fuck u guys of your retail money 

Amd$ hell even I got a put at 52 week highs hell all time highsIts all about your expectations. I'm really only looking to go up $75 to $100 then sell. But if you keep holding it expecting a 10 bagger...wellNopeLol okAlwaysopening has to pass visible light to be considered a doughnut under international standardsTopology is destinyBro Americans spend as soon as they get paper they’re not like europoors keeping it under their pillowsIt will "force" a lot of people to go back to work. Might hurt spending in the short term but the whole economy will be better off.99.5% of people on UI aren't spending it on the stock market.It matters because our economy is spent on people spending money on shit. We are almost entirely a consumer based economy, if people don't have money to buy shit, then everything suffers.You do realize that poorer individuals are more likely to spend their money than richer individuals, right? This consumption is essential for the economy to function. Without it, aggregate demand plummetsI had 10 August 2.5c been chillin my account for like 3 weeks. Today they went up by 160%. Loaded up on some September calls for Monday to sell. Last time they pumped was over a $5m contract, and they went up close to 80%. Today was a 35m contract and only up so far like 30-50%... I expect Monday they will shoot another 20-30% maybe break 2


I wish I would’ve yoloed like 1k worth of calls 3 weeks ago.Yes. August and Sept 2.5s. This will prob dump before earnings. Hopefully monday is continued pump.China & us growth was well stunted I thoughtNo one is going to Starbucks my dudeTQQQ master raceI averaged down and am now holding an uncomfortable amount of qqq calls. October though so I'm not stressing yet. Big week next week let's goooooWhy is pton a good call?Strike and expiry?Damn that ain't cheap. At that point why even bother with 8/7s lolBeen thinking to add but I doubt they will announce too soon so probably will have time to add. Kinda hoping hype fizzle out so I can pick some up at under 21.

Thought about it at 21.5 today tho.How did you buy them? I can’t get it on thinkorswim or robinhoodIntel has been on life support for awhile. I’m nervous tooIntel's not going back to $60 anytime soon bruh. It's going to trade in the lower 50s range for sometime. The news yesterday was extremely bad. They will have no competitive product until 2022...Works until it doesn't!They might even do what AMD did and sell off their fabs to TSMC or GlobalFoundries. Reduces R&D expense, brings in cash, reduces capital expenditures as well.What’s the retard summary of what a horizontal spread isDamn. Didn't notice this. Luckily I sold most of mine for a profit and bought AMD FDs in the morning.FYes. Then buy gold when your done.[deleted]And with 5 seconds left in the day i am now long USDHKD lolGyna. Printer.

They sold my position at a shitty price so I wouldn’t get assigned 2 hrs before close like WTF. If they would have waited 10 minutes I would have saved $50, if they waited an hour I would have saved $100. So pissed.all earnings plays are pretty dumbcancer

They'll probably do their morning pump and afternoon dumpThey sold a lot of toilet paperI wouldn't play walmart unless youre getting a good ITM option with a decent expiration, could play until it runs up to earnings. 

Maybe UPS? that'd be a good oneNoswbi > vsto > rgr

in that order

You could make 20% on this pretty easily probably but it's not going to take you to tendie town.So Robinhood doesn’t even display if that’s a call or a put?  God, what a shitty app.7/31 $60c was at $0.07Does anyone here care about the next 12 months?It would be everything, but especially companies that are overvalued, such as tech. You could see the market as a whole go down 10%, but tech stock could easily go down 20%.I hope ur asking so u know when to buy calls and not puts.I got calls3300Nothing good💀I don’t have money in it but I feel like calls were the safe play.Maybe I'll scalp some FDs, got some PFE thoughDon’t touch overtraded stocks, iv is pumped too much and risk is unfavorable regardless which side you take420Yeah all gains wiped this weekNVDA 7/31 435cJust hand me your $13; same resultAmd$ putsAAPL puts before earningsMPCSLV 25c 7/31Intel $60 calls late fall.SHOP puts if they don't live up to the hype at earningsTesla 500 or 2500By August bro 

Just stop being so poorI say yes bc Donald wants the election and markets going to be highYes because I'm all in on SLV and AUY.Yes.  Because Forbes said soLooking iffy.  Senate recesses Aug. 7 tho so whatever is gonna happen has to happen before that.no, id save it though since silver has a decent shot of reaching 50 dollars an ounce, especially if you look at historic gold/silver ratioThe raw value of them are increasing. Any intrinsic value you would have to look up.The silver eagles carry about a 4 or 5 dollar per coin premium. All coinnshops I've spoken with can't keepnthem on the shelves. Anything from the U.S. mint is always a better investment aside from maybe larger bars.QQQ is not a representation of the NASDAQ, it is weighted more heavily to large cap tech than the average Nasdaq stockFuck that must have cost some money 💰Doesn’t mean anything. They work and don’t work when they want to.Bitch McConnel said they would definitely be going back on vacation the 7th.basically all the tech that reported earnings Friday will either bounce back or correct depending on how they reacted to earnings. This is a Monday play. 

Unless everything is down. Then all bets are off.I think PFE will do something next week. I also think AMD/INTC will have movementDirty Money, season 2 just came out tooAmy Schumer, great wildlife stuffDown to Earth was enjoyable for meBusiness of drugs(maybe called drug inc dont remember), mafia v nyOperation Odessa is a must watchAmerican VandalKazaamAny Given SundayFinding NemoWhat if the aliens have ray guns that turn you gay?

Starting to doubt the play tbh.Not there^ 

Ha! Rhyme[deleted]Buy 3 months outThat’s a hedge, time spread, calendar spread or whatever you want to call it. It’s good to reduce potential losses and winnings. Too much complexity and if you dont got no phd and are calculator geek - you would be better off just trying to buy calls once it “starts to level out” as you said.I usually open calendar debit spreads. E.g. I sell WMT 7/31 135c for .59 and buy the 8/7 135c for 1.37. This trade costs me .78 and it gives the ability to eat the shorter-dated call whilst allowing for longer-term upward speculationWell it does have tech in its name also so does UBER.  Why?I'm selling 7/31 BYND Vertical Puts, Shit is probably going to run up before earnings in 2 weeks. Nice risk/reward with retarded IVEasy.

If he pretends like he gives a shit now by November a majority will be like Trump was amazing during covid.>He disregarded bat soup for awhile

You mean like back in March when he was trying to shut stuff down and Pelosi and Cuomo were saying go outside because its nothing to fear?

Or did you mean Trump disregarded it and that is why Cuomo sent 4,500 COVID possed geriatrics back into the nursing homes?

&#x200B;

Doesn't the responsibility for dealing with the Bat AIDS lie with the state governors anyway? Isn't executive branch power essentially limited to closing the borders and that's it? Even Nat Guard deployment needs state approval.

Hate to tell you this, but...uhhh....you're in that majority.

Even ignoring the news: look at the deaths/case stats on a case by case basis. Something like 3 of the top 3 and 8 of the top 10 states by death rate are states with anti-Trump governors.

Long on automakers and motorcycle manufacturers because all those people who used to take public transport in the COVID decimated areas are not going to be getting back on subways and busses to go back to work.

Go for a run or do some pull upsI did nsuns531 until I got my 1RM conventional to 200 Kg. 

The deadlift days were hell but doable with enough sleep and food.

Trap Bar is great for extra volume and keeping the spine safe under fatigue.

You can do a max effort day working up to your conventional deadlift 1RM on day one and then do a volume day were you do 50 reps of 70% of your weekly 1RM with the trap bar.

Lifting is a skill and learning to max out is important.

Edit: If you are a noob and lift under 1.25x your bodyweight, you should go to r/fitness and read the faq with the recommended routine.

Don't work up to your weekly 1RM when you are new to the game.Leave major compound lifts to one day a week and then other days do accessory lifts for your back and core. Deadlifts are 90% core strength and make sure you pinch your upper back/keep your lats tight while progressing thru the movement.NoYou realize there are straight people that are attracted to ugly, smelly, hairy, disgusting guys.

Indian is less so (though they’ll likely be getting heat soon. Chief wahoo going away for sure). 

Can you imagine if the Detroit lions were the Detroit blackskins? Or the Cincinnati reds were the Cincinnati whiteskins? Shits just unnecessarily offensive. 

Washington should change their name to the bulls. And Cincinnati can be the bears.Washington owner slaves, so eventually they will just be called “football team.”Redskin's logo was designed by a member of the Blackfeet Tribe and grandkid of the chief pictured in the logo. The team and the tribe have had great relationship for decades. The tribe even performs at games.Atlanta braves?Chief Wahoo has been getting phased out since 2017.They’re next, but, “redskins”.

Why has EA, a fucking powerhouse been kanging?

Riddle me any of this.Any positive news about vaccine or declining case rates will make travel stocks rise. The market is forward looking... These prices reflect the known fact that October is the earliest (and that could change positively or negatively).

Ruminating will only hurt youyou sir are a bitchWhat? Just cuz you missed out? So what? Always next time. I missed on more than ive been in.Doing a lot of drugs seems to help meBuy Intel calls instead! The dip will be bought!!There is no answer on predicting the future man. Don't dwell on the past or you will miss out on the next move. I sold my amd calls when they hit 58 and thought i was a genius then realized i missed out on 10k. But im not losing sleep, just trying to learn from mistakes.obviously no one can predict the future and exactly when AMD would pop.

Do your research, notice how successful TSMC has been, and who has been using TSMC to manufacture their chips. Hint: AMD

Look at AMD's products, compare specs against INTC, you will find out that AMD is competitive at a cheaper price.

Once you know these things, start buying into the company, huge, with shares and long dated calls. And you wait patiently. If you're right, you will make money long term.Yup sucks, won't be the last, move on to the nextThis will help.  A few years ago (when I was single), I put $20k in to trade options.  I was YOLO almost every trade and rolled my acct to about $300k in a few months.  Had a small losing streak so went almost all in on BA and MGM puts that expired in 2 weeks.  Over $200k worth.  Plan was not to do anything for a week and just hold.  In a day I was up almost 20k so I sold and switched to calls.   The next day t the market absolutely crashed and BA and MGM both dropped about 15-18%.   If I held I would have had $2.5 million and would have cashed out that day.   Instead I lost about $160k.  A few days later was appl earnings and this was when every quarter they exploded. Put balance on Apple calls and it tanked for the first time in years after earnings. I felt sick for about 2 weeks thinking about how close I came to multi millionaire status.  That hurt more than the losing of the money.  

I learned don’t dwell on it.  It’ll eat you up and there’s nothing you can do about it anyway.  I took years off from options.  I’m still a degenerate but a much much much smarter one now  😉I’m straight and I get aroused when I touch mineBanJust when they wipeIf true then I might turn gay, sex with yourself sounds awesomeWtf are you on mangtfo you fucking creepHello this is Chris Hansen.Some 16 year olds look physically the same as 25 year olds, doesn't mean I wanna fuck em, because like they're 16I really

“Ok time to delete Robinhood. Wait, AMD is finally mooning after months of watching it do nothing?! *Make money on AMD calls* okay I guess I’ll delete it another day”Thank you.If you reply to all my comments like this, I might actually stopI honestly think I wouldn’t have this problem if it wasn’t for the boring pandemic.Yes this is the way.Huh, interesting.Must do this.Fuck 😂😂😂Time to smack my meatYes I’ve been thinking of doing this with BA and AMD.


Except AMD has taken flight and now I’m butthurt so I’m trying to catch the action with calls. 55 was a really good entry price, ughI have AMD calls expiring 8/21. HehI made money today. With AMD calls.

I think its all just about getting in on momentum. I responded to u/Kaith8 that kinda just outlines how I like to trade. The market is just unpredictable as fuck rn. No doubt you could easily do the same.Maybe more TSM, I didnt re-enter my positions with them today because who tf knows where they might land after a day like today but id their gains stick I’ll probably pick up some long positions with them.  I’m also looking at DIN because its a fraction of it’s pre-covid price but their recovery is almost solely based on vaccine progress. If I had the money to go long on them I would.lmao that's why you don't mention that other shit. Just the fact that Intel still outperforms AMD in gaming on a larger chip and the next shit will be even better. The point I'm making is Intel executives are fucking retardsLmao Intel would be at 70 if Bob Swan had said exactly that on his CNBC interviewlol I fucking know that. I'm just saying Intel could've handled this shit a lot betterThe best box, believe meCmon babe.Pretty sure everything from TB is already served reheated from yesterday...If he keeps up this wild ride to the top, he will be at 68.6% in a year.No, YOU have a better one!Thanks pal!

Just because you have a trading account doesn't mean you have to trade it to 0 like all the retards here.I’ve seen my account hit the lowest of lows in late 2018 and back in February. I’m just so desensitized to those feelings. Maybe I’m just emotionally and mentally capable of withstanding losses that I’m willing to keep all this money in rhFor my HS graduation when I was 17 I asked my parents for $500 to invest and I started with AAPL and it all started from there10 -> 20 -> 9 -> 28 -> 12.

Sounds like something I could kill some hours with.👍This is the way, but let the dust settle a little longer.Fair enough. I just want to get 30-50% and I'm out. Up 15% EOD so should be alrightI meant it did the last two days. I think we see people pile back in immediately. Especially if AMD doesn't blow it out of the water on ER 7/28Most likelyThats why my strategy isnt necessarily to win, its to not lose. Keep it green, fellasI feel you dude, I’ve been broke broke too many times but have been on the up for almost a year. I mean like you said, once you hit rock bottom anything after that isn’t shit. I just couldn’t imagine killing myself over anything less than 1mil to be honest.Oh 100%, it’s just delusional to invest everything you have to hope you make it. I just don’t understand the mindset I guess. I get gambling addictions and such, but it just baffles me when people will take out loans to trade then be baffled when they lose it.True lolcoolantnever raced one but in a straight line roll 100%. camrys are fast af and really nice.

I'm on the verge of cancelling prime because delivery has become hit and miss. Don't use music or movies, literally just for shipping. I know it's USPS or UPS fault, but if I can't get 2-day free shipping consistently, I'm letting it expire in September. I can't be there only one eitherWhy?

Thanks man.I coulda made 40% on intel 0dte this morning and I didn’t and let it expire worthless.I Like that flair.This was my feeling as well. Losing 2% in a week and 5% in a month is huge for the world’s reserve currencyWith states reentering lock-down how do you come up with the velocity of money increasing? The latest M2V from the Fed shows velocity falling off a cliff, and commodities, which are highly inflation sensitive, have recently either leveled off or started reversing their trends. The only inflationary impulse we have right now is mortgages, but everybody agrees that it's a combination of historically low supply and urban flight, neither of which is sustainable. I expect 1Q21 to be a deflationary bloodbath as all those mortgages currently in forbearance start getting evicted and the houses go up for short-sales. We delayed the crash, we didn't stop it.*who could have saw this coming?*its really gonna blow when markets crash and the dollar doesnt go upLmao I've heard that 11 times since MarchFalseI concur that Truly is betterTrue they’re about to run out of peopleYAY, GIRL POWER!6hrs 43 mins yesterdayYou gotta pump those numbers up!Im not the only broken oneYou sleep fuck that noise been up for two days, going to sleep tonight though.

US wealth inequality has gotten to the point where civil wars usually happen (estimating with Gini coefficient). Civil unrest has gotten to levels we’ve never reached before. This left-right conflict just needs to turn into a top-bottom conflict. I think another financial collapse might do it for us.Its a rare trade where smart money have been piling in for years, and now dumb money is finally giving it attention and piling in to thrust momentum forwardThat's not until the pandemic is over IMO. Probably wait till 2022 for that.

If it gets past that it’s 26 nextDon’t really dive down too far into conspiracies but Joe Rogan had a really interesting podcast with Bob Lazar who claims he studied the energy harnessed and used for propulsion in UFO’s at Area 51. Really good listen if you’re not familiar with the story. I think the article I read about the pentagon said they’re releasing some classified material on UFO findings across the next 180 days. Going to be a fun couple months to close out the year.He’ll have all weekend to titty-twist Moscow Mitch into caving on the $1,200/week stimulus.Look at the sub you're in. They expire today.Fuck you fat guyYeah same here. If nothing happens over the weekend, we’ll likely gap up Monday from the relief and AMZN will be the first in line.I did the exact same thing blew $20k but mine are October expirationI’m good.Cup of cocoa will make it better.NiceGot a ticker? I'm inWhat positions do you have currently?Damn that’s rough :(Ouch.  What was your mistake?Wow! -$375k to $78k how did you do that?Basically always in green right?What are you waiting for with the 80% cash?Wow quite the journey!Basically quite in the green!BullishI’m also balls deep in MPC august calls so... no2008-2009 was amazing. That was my intro to options I was in my 20sNot surprising. It’s also why it’s an especially good play because most people haven’t heard much about it, or they think it’s a boring steel company that doesn’t move very much. Expect big things though in the next few weeksImagine the balls selling a naked 50c 1/21I'll try to believeI'll try to believe!Priced inI can't. This is the ultimate margin call manWifey matters are traded 24/7 you silly goose!Black matter lives.I wasn’t aware WhatsApp was that popular. In Japan they use Line, Korea uses Kakao, China uses WeChat. I’m assuming it’s big in Europe?Its currently in a strong leadThis crowd can't hear the logic around teslaWhat is the FsD tech?But intel was underwhelming.The FED helped the owners of capitalDamn. That was depressing but true.Yeah, hard not to think that we have everything we need.

Yet, there’s that one breakthrough that changes society.

I like to think ahead, like 20-50 years, what’s something everyone will need or flock to.As long as it’s not the middle class. Except it will be.Fuck that. They already robbing my checks and I got my 401k maxed literally half my check is gone before I even get itJust have a wealth cap of 1B or like an income cap of 50M or something. Who could even disagree with that fr.

Edit: Threaten war with countries with offshore accounts holding untaxed American money and take that shit back. Like we can't get tiny island nations to stop laundering money lolBITCH GGGGGG UNIT✊✊✊😍😍SIR I can to buy the Wendy’s

Now go add bacon to my burger bitch 

Or I’ll fire u and no more 600+ unemployment 



Good go feel bad about your worthless degree and life chooses bitch and blame everyone but yourselfI literally just learned of her yesterday.Silly goose. Student loan debt can't be discharged. That whole "forgiveness" thing is only for businesses.

(Hint: start a business. The SBA about beat down my door trying to give me a loan.)I’d even be cool with them padding the bankers wallets in the process.I can see that happening too but you have to remember that a lot of Dems are up for re-election too and if anything bad happens, their district might blame them for it and switch to republican which they don't want to happen.No they dont lolLong calls on inverse ETFs with low theta.They will soon buddy. It's either that or let America crash. I predict they will probably wait until after election and then they will raise interest rates and just start buying the S & P.Dude, we didn't know about infinity qe.

This is not the Fed's final form to put it simply.Doesn't really matter. The alternative is raise rates and print less and let the market crash which they are absolutely not going to do because that will wipe out massive amounts of real wealth in the country and we cannot let china win.I moved my stop up as well but I thought it would close the gap today because the market was heading downSame. Still walked away with 30% though. Was a pain to get back from lunch and see it at 118% loolStill made some slave mastersFuck forgot all about that. Kinda don’t know that worksPretty muchPoot credit spreadsLike 17k lol, like 5-8 bucks out depends on the dayAre you saying SLV and GLD weren't good plays?I bought spreads, but yes I agree. IV definitely doing down after most likely.Are you talking about AUY or SLV lolliterally couldn't go tits upWatch these crooks report a loss at earnings and the stock rebound to $11..this. Their beer gives me nasty hangovers even with just 2-3, but those new Truly lemonades...good shit, especially in smoothies. They straight up gashed into Mike's Hard Lemonade profitsI had qqq calls I bought at close yesterday. Thank god I had more LVGO put contracts than qqq calls. It hedged nicely this morning and I didn't suffer a terrible loss.Great way to end the week I can tell you that.We'll see if I can hit that 20k mark again in 2 weeks. If not I may just hold longBetter than an old fashion IMOYou think they’ll hit 3300 by EOY?Touches 2500 after earningsWait I can pay for this with Doggycoin? Hallelujahyou’ve been?that’s what i’m thinkinDamn that would’ve been legit today...Thanks, you too!🚨 this is going up 300% follow me for more great tips buy buy buy 🚨Still bag holding, Msft calls 7/31 and 8/2190c lol holy shit

I have 76c 7/31 lets all make itCCJ is pretty goodthat just doesnt seem importantHell yeahYou on 8/6: GUHThe overwhelming majority lmaoNo shit. 22 million budget to study technology from another world. 3 trillion to keep the stock market afloat. If they really wanted to find out more they would have spent shit ton to research them. It’s classified USA tech.No, we need to disclose because there is a credible threat assessment that China has 'hacked' several SAP program research and there is a race to get patents on it. Pentagon has to disclose to prove they held the tech first. https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/28729/docs-show-navy-got-ufo-patent-granted-by-warning-of-similar-chinese-tech-advancesSweet, my wife just asked why I laughed and now I have to read her this.How many?No. Inb4 is old internet speak for "miss me with that"Third times a charm? 🤷🏻‍♂️Me too. Well one Sep and one late Aug but next chance I get I’ll push the Aug to a Sep. hoping for a nice random +5% to +10% day where I’ll probably sell and then wait for a nice dip. Or just hold since timing is impossibleYou sell?I enjoy listening to Netflix in the background while I monitor the market. I never actually watch Netflix but it’s always on.congrats, 8 months for me, never going backwell done sir, keep up the good workI might have had it in January had a horrible cold where I coughed so much I couldn't sleepCan you explain this in english?I don't trade ASX but our market generally follows the trends of the USlol you must be newCash gang > buy daily dip > sell at the top > rinse and repeat 

No need to be a bearWe need some mega shit posting sometime soon. The market hasn’t been mematic enough lately to get some great content. And my dumb ass isn’t creative enough to be a content-creatorI haven’t played any video games since early March, but I’m thinking about getting COD and just spending 8 hours a day on it until I start my new job1400 seems reasonable, maybe more or less. Could even be worth $2,000.. but the speed of the gain is absurd. TSLA isn't worth 40% more now than it was a month ago. Just can't gain 40% monthly forever.MSFT's hit a ceiling for now. I exited one of my short puts for a slight gain. The rest of them expired worthless.Turned $220 into 30k thanks to amdLoud music apparently. It's Friday evening at 6 pm so I'm ignoring. Fair no?How dare you, his mother's bosoms are saggy as fuck, puts on that doctor if they're artificial!Wrong answer, bro. For the 1% of the country that owns 85% of stonks, it’s about wealth preservation mainly. So yes, the wealthy having cash sitting on the sidelines makes perfect sense. RE crash will happen and when it does, they’ll be a waiting for all the fire sales happening.Agree, I wont catch anythingCNBC is STACKEDYeah but AOC got POWERBut we could fit a lot of our tiny dicks that largemouth at onceShe graduated cum laude from Boston University, retard.Its the power, dude. Shes got intangiblesNah man, her intelligence and badassness is what makes her so attractive. 

She's gonna moon once she turns 35. $AOC 11/2024 calls 🚀🚀You upset that I’m pretending to be upset on a gambling subreddit? 

Which one of us is the pussy now?The worst part is that it was a position I had held all week in the hopes of it working out and I had so many fucking chances to get out but I had faith in myself and the position. When it finally works out I just decide to wait a little longer for some more and it fucks me overIdk yet. Probably pick 3 tech companies that have had the largest run ups. 10-15% otm fds. Entire portfolioStale or not, it's comforting.Usually downside, cough cough theta lolNo, I just think it is interesting that the CEO dumped all of these shares right before news that the company lost a patent lawsuit to ABUS. Smells oddly of insider trading. Also, if they really stood behind their vaccine product and company, they might re-invest those funds into R&D and manufacture of the vaccine--maybe just live off their multi-million dollar salary until the vaccine is released.Inverse?I'm done. Convert a couple, but it's not worth it. People think you are selling cancer.Just push the date out and looks like a good first play!Don't know if Reddit is around when my account is 20 years old, but here goes: RemindMe! 10 yearstrue or not... a white person today cannot be blamed for a structure that was built 300 years ago. All they can do is recognize the difference to hope for a change, although I get it; some do take advantage of this structure as well.You are the winner.  I will rain 1% of all my tendies on you.Let's hope it good faith :)Nice! May seem like a pussy trade but I lock in the following percentage allocations in the portfolio:

\- 50% stocks

\- 40% leaps

\- 10 % play money on fd's. 

I did get screwed on some weekly's today. What can you do?Thanks and I agree. Will be monitoring closely.Damn this takes the cake if trueDamnThem overdraft fees be adding up too lol😂😂It seems earnings always cause stocks to drop. Microsoft beat earnings, stock dropped. Nike missed earnings, stock dropped.

It's like earnings is the anniversary in a relationship that was on cruise control and it forces everyone to think "why am I with this person,.where do I see this relationship going" and then they panic and sell.But BUD is a much bigger brand and felt beaten down. SAM is well past ATH now and anyone who saw it gaining more than $100 today is nutsI know man it’s nutsWhenever I’m in Boston I always have some Sam Adams. But Truly must have been a huge boon for this quarantineYeah in retrospect it made way too much senseWell shit I hope it was a spread. If you are new then it’s good to know that spreads prevent you from taking on risk that exposes you to theoretically infinite downside potential.Here you go buddy. https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/goldman-spots-historic-inversion-market252 million is hardly anything thoREITSINTCAt least RH has a start over button.Once you open an account they will call you and see how you like it, if you have any questions, etc.  And it's not some guy from offshore, the guy who called me was in the same city I live.  They are a real brokerage.Why would that cause a sell off? Especially leading into earning which are expect to kill it? That doesnt make any sense.Thin crust best crustHonestly I’m down for either one sitting on 2x 9/18 AMD 65 straddles sold the 80c for 9/18 to lock in gains on one sideI should rephrase.

Market value of NKLA is 2/3 that of the market value of subaruStill being extra nice in after hoursBought calls before close yesterday just for a lotto play, worked out great.Might have to nowI definitely would regret making that play. You think they're going to bounce back quickly? The stock had 1 day to digest, it very well could go down further next week. I'm definitely going to investigate maybe some shares, since they are a huge player, but that company has got to figure it's shit out. The fact they are 6 months behind on their 7nm chips, while AMDs are out and the new Ryzen core chips are crushing Intel's performance and are cheaper... INTC is a lonnnnnnng term play here, and probably just a shares play because dividends. My 2 cents, but best of luck, I sold my 63Ps at open for 300% on them. Lucky gamble, but makes total sense after they dropped the roadmap info on call.nah some stupid day trades I paper handedI thought it ended Monday when Amazon gained 8% but nope it lost all the gainsA possible shitty stimulus , and unemployment slightly upticking again mixed with trimming profits could make for an interesting week ahead .Me two my last 8k is in a 3200creading too many stories of people getting caught, not worth the riskLmao my buddy just started an unpaid AM, he’s not allowed to trade options, what a fucking scamOnly flat because the USD dropped. It basically inflated a red week by 2%, which happened to make it flat.

If we continue  on this trend but the USD stops drilling, it won't stay flat.And CA isn’t?Send me pics of ur RAM bbyLol huh?But you're not a Chinese saboteur.But I don’t wanna be smart, I wanna be rich!  Waaaaaaaaaahhh!!Show me da wae sirDamn. That's brutal bro. That was a surprising run thoughI miss all the DD for SPY 180p and TQQ 30pearnings estimates being low would lead me to believe they beat earnings and pump a bit tho. callsYou’re not wrong. I keep hearing about services from Apple but the only good one they offer is Apple Music.

If it wasn’t for the iOS Apple App Store they would be in a very bad position. And depending on the courts they very well may be.I need it to pull back. I wanna go in stronger lol. Can't now.The stocks i have are down 70 percent since the beginning of the year lol. Wtf are you talking aboutPshhh ride or die with my robinhood chumps boyoI'm an air traffic controller and no joke the military has been using their military operation areas to practice with their jets and shit ALOT recentlyWell, no, IV is the only difference, they are the same amount OTM.Market isn’t rational right now. Smart money has caught up to that.I don’t, but volatility in option pricing is symmetric, doesn’t that mean there’s a “can’t go tits up” play? Something, something put-call parity...I was new to options lolIf things start going real bad, you don't think Taiwan will be the very first occupied country? China already owns Taiwan in their book, it's just a matter of time before they pull a Crimea.Intel is the only domestic fab. The government has no other choice.It's just a matter of time. 

Either China collapses or the West stays stronger .But right now China is growing in leaps and bounds and the west is cracking. Once China gets confident enough that they can scare off the west, Taiwan is occupied.AAPL uses TSMC though.Yeah and TSMC is in China, or not China but still China.

The government will bankroll Intel to catch up.Maybe backstop was the wrong word, but they're gonna give them fat contractsAye aye cap!So everyone here now must be loaded, congratsThe videos are always grainy AF like 1980s technology. Meanwhile the Air Force brags of crazy high def cameras that can see the stitches on a football from "space". 

..which one is it? Where's the high def UFO footage? Why has the number of handheld cameras gone up exponentially while the number of UFO sightings remains relatively flat over the same years ? 

Common sense is so rare these days.Otherwise I’m just going to fuck a box jellyfish or blue ring octopus . That’s alien and deadly enoughYou must think I am a 🌈🐻GrafIf they’re actually gonna come out and reveal this tech, we’re talking over the next few years. If they DO go through with it, it would be a miracle. This tech would change everything and secure America’s military economic dominance, as space based industry would be very straight forward. 

But I kinda doubt they’ll disclose, because it would be admitting to other nations that such tech is possible to build and not just fantasy.It fucking looks like a pokemonThanks! I always appreciate the support. You can see other subreddits trending tickers on /r/RedditTickers.I bought them before it was coolLife*I called Facebook a weak ass bitch today multiple timesHahahahahahah👊👊👊👊✊✊elon will just announce that theyre working on ventilators again.In a rare showing I actually got straight puts instead of spreads. A 5%circuit breaker would be an instant 7 bagger 🤤No that would be insider tradingIm swinging dix over the weekend>Also big boy earnings next week, if they hit that’ll pump

Just like Microsoft and Tesla did?I find your offense at his offense highly objectionable.SLVThey already saying to slash down to $200 from the $600.I’ve seen a lot of people I wouldn’t usually see out in public recently. Like people buying $40 of Starbucks and walking it back to their $1,000 car in the 18-23 age range. That’s gonna go away when the $600 goes awayClam down deal will be struck this Sunday night just in time for the market to open green.Always been 🤡.They still haven't. Everyone is banking on it's election year. It expires next week.Oh please tell me, who's hiring?OR perhaps employers should start paying fair wages. Keep licking your boss’ boots if it gets your rocks off, but some of us would like a more equitable society.Pretty sure the virus and no ability to afford treatment if you get it keeps people from having jobs and the 600$ just keeps them from getting evicted but you can get angry about it if you want.Spy can do whatever the fuck it wants. I need TSLA to gap down again.New week, new opportunities.Mortgage defaults are on the way too.Didn’t Powell say a month or so ago he wouldn’t consider it until 2022 at the earliest? Maybe the situation has changed though with the dollar tanking.Is this even on the table?why would they raise rates early? lolGood, my bank account could use a pump up in the interest rates.But suit man I was told that it LITTERALLY CANT GO TITS UPweekend sexNice drinking game15.85 a pieceYeah what he saidCheck your inbox.Same reason I don’t say Messi’s first name125 7/31 same. FedEx took the fuck off. No reason ups should be different.F. Typo. 400.I lucked out and ended up down only 20ish.that was my exact calculation as well.Thanks for the heads up on CLDR. I’ve added it to my watchlist and will hopefully add some on Monday. I opened my leaps on NET today, so my plan is to sell the 45c 1/15/21 when we see some decent green to lower the cost basis of my 38c. Good luck to you broyes, corrected.

how much premium did you have to pay for those?Yes, expensive lesson learned.No, I don’t think so - I certainly have the cash in the account to cover the premiums, but I suppose they can’t count on me to sell the contracts before they exercise, if they wind up ITM.It seemed to sell JUST before the drop - they sold my 320p’s for $0.26 per and then I watched them jump to $0.60+ while on hold with customer service. Was a swing of like $3-4K.

The weird thing is they even liquidated my 315p’s that had just about no chance of being ITM (guess it was better to get $0.01 per than nothing).I should have repurchased the 320p’s after seeing them start to run up but was annoyed to have to pay another $1.30 commission per contract. Sigh.Yes it does lol. I’m already up about 25% and not feeling great about my decision to let it ride.The online sales are what I’m expecting to boost this.This guy gets it. It’s still not to late to get in. Silver will boom after all/during all this shit.This is the way7/24 ‘market gets fucked by big red dildos all day’Why?in the end it will all just be armed bands of young men fighting each other over the last bits of foodFar OTM SPY puts. I tried to flip them with a day trade. They lost value throughout the day, but not much. But Monday morning they’ll be worthless unless WW3 really starts.Always wondered this myself but didn’t wanna google cockringsThey're supposed to help my boyfriend's dick stay hardKeeps blood in your pp if you have limp dickThey stop blood flow so you dont cumwsb would probably solely be responsible for 4.20% and 6.9% gains everyday.what the fuck, 6k = one month of quality? Most people in America don't even clear 3k a month lolI felt like I went from using an iPhone to a jitterbug.  Luckily, I just put a couple hundred in there to try it out.  Gross.29th is fomc, amazon reports the day afterNot convincedYou’re god damn right it is. Even getting a bitch for the poochShe in her home town. So she’s with all the exesMy European broker only does vix calls for some stupid reason. Vix puts is clearly the way .Last weeks Thursday/Friday pull back it $58,this week low was $60.  So hopefully that means a higher high next week. It hit the 65 resistance and 64.75 resistance multiple times and got rejected this past week. 

Was also encouraged it didnt bleed as bad as the other nasdaq stocks. You?No big deal at all just surprised it didn’t get automatically sold before close since Robinhood usually sells itm contracts like an hour before close automatically (Lol why am I still on Robinhood after all this time)Also it could shit the bed over the weekendif u can afford 100 shares of a company that you think is good it’s quite a good strategy 


watch videosThere is a case for theta, if my understanding is right, either vertical call spread or calendar call spread. I hardly lose money on those and easily get 10% and forgiving for missteps and let you play with the big boys as oppose to sub $50 stocks.BothNo shit. In this day and age, knocking on someone's door might fall under the castle doctrine.Glory days.I need to look into that. I keep slacking and get caught up in all the daily noise.Make or break ur acc.So all I did all week was buy my options right before close each day. Then sell right around market open then next morning all while not using a day trade! I’m looking forward to having my day trades free Monday so I can get some quick 20 minute scalps. It’s stressful as hell holding weekly options overnightIt's probably gonna be the same story where they guide additional expenses involved in covid related shit.

At current valuation it probably won't be forgiving. But I'm sure it'll continue on to be over 3k after whatever drop happens.Mnst was a fun play when it was pinned to $69 now idk what to do with itYeah I feel that. I sold a covered call on this week and like 10 mins before close it showed 99% loss and then fixed itself, so my chart now has a massive dip showing in itDon’t tell anyone but 8k of the 10k is shares. I made 13k on AZN yolo Monday I’m not trying to give it all back yet.Yea I’m up about 20% from entry. Hopefully those online sales killed it like I’m thinking they did.I meant to say you can only buy stock in one company for the rest of your life what company is itThis guy fucksLGF! 🚀🚀🚀 three rockets means it can’t go tits up.Am I going to be okay next week?unemployment gang🤑LolI've transcended and am now in florida... please continuethis>>I think the dollar is based on a lot more. How come the dollar does not have large swings or increase in value. What if everyone just invested in the dollar? Wouldn’t that just make it more valuable?Ouch 🤕🤕It’s weird cuz it seemed like he was excited about ita classicAlmost 12k, so -75% basically rnYeah and this reddit is basically a casinoI have 18 months of theta idgaf about weeksAG FSM are the two I like the mostnah back to the old Doug, jokes about kids getting killed and gofundme'sHis last one was terrible, I don't know what happened to him.QQQ strangles, gold and silver monthly leaps, industrials stocks and sell calls, Intel ITM monthly calls,

VXX weeklies.

Note: don’t do just one of these, this is a strategy best played as a whole.You have a point my good sirGreat selection!

Good luck!It’ll dump.Yeah, nothing has popped on earnings in months. No reason it will eitherThanks, can you tell me what the fuck they areI grabbed some 53c and 55c 7/31 and 52c Aug 7 looking for a quick flip on the weeklies. All bought .20 off the bottom of the day.  Sept. has action for sure.thanks, Ill just look inside myselfhow lolYes, for example the stock market.I did that shit in college, didn't enjoy it at all. Getting blackout drunk or so high I can't tell time moving gets me sad af knowing how much time I missedoh ffsI live in Seattle bro chill. I used uni as a short for university lmaoThis is a terrible take.University of Kentucky my dudeNah... Only 299 of them do. That one guy went back and told their story.THE SPY 300

waitBest estimated eps is probably what they meanGrowth during a pandemic? How much have other automakers grown?yeah, I think there's a strategy that's like overwhelm your opponent with speed and information.  who knows if what he's saying is actually good or accurateThat's what snakes do.

They talk fast to overwhelm you, they expect you to give a thorough reply to one statement so by the time you complete your single retort host such as himself moved onto 5 different statements.

It's why Fox news is a dying format because people actually like lengthy debates.I only found one and he was owned in that interviewDid you see what happened to MSFT? Could be a sell the news kind of thingmy man said put positionMaybe 325.Indeed. I have concernsIll be in a cardboard box soon bagholding my apple callsI had applied for a margin account almost immediately after I started trading since I hated that my funds would take time to clear. So I didn't realize that there are different rules for cash accounts as far as day trades. All I knew was the rules for margin accounts I guess.

It does suck though to potentially be limited in how many day trades you can make simply because you are waiting for the funds to clear which takes a day for options. So really having a cash only account isn't probably all that great regardless.What you got. I'm still waiting for the Somali stock exchange to get back to me, also looking at the Pakistani and Tokyo exchanges.At the height of the recession in 2009 there were 6.5 mil continuing unemployment claims. We're still at 16 mil 4 months into this and a lot of states have reversed course on reopening.Wasn't there a federal eviction moratorium?Reality is a tough pill.If everyone is saying  earnings are gonna be bad. I don't think there's gonna be a run up. It might just start selling off on Monday/TuesdayVxx 7/31 29C wish I did Vix instead moved way more

Some where quick flips. Missed a Tsla call by .1 and that would have been a 40 percent increase in 30 minutestrue 😂

it did seem like good idea thoThat’s what I got boiiiiiiiit was a 7/31 c

i should’ve waited till EOD to buy tho imohonestly i started thinking about it and was like 


who the fuck wants to buy intel instead of amd?


and sold it.Thanks been holding amd$ for about 8 months 

I bought at all time highs to 33$ after the google news 

Been my bae every since 

But I always exit at 52 week highs amd$ has Sirpassed that I don’t wanna stay for earningsThat and invest in metals. Way ahead of yaFuck 7, bitch ate 9I think they did... it didn't go as well as you'd hope; people under contract were never worth more than 60% of a person not under contract, at least for voting purposes.It never stopped. People now live paycheck to paycheck and work for huge corporations you can buy "shares".

Very little has actually changed. 

We've just continued to create insane ownership models to hide the fact that this never changed.Don’t ever think like that

On the bright side it’s market cap is under $1 billion at the moment so it’s not getting too over valued right now (for this market**)The most consequential trump executive order is his Mcdonalds order.Basically what I read was:

First order lowers the price of prescriptions so that it is comparable to other countries.

Second order allows prescription imports from Canada.

Third order stops middlemen from profiting from  discounts.

Fourth order allows Medicare to purchase prescriptions at the same price as other countries. He wants to establish an international pricing index for prescriptions so that they stay in line with the rest of the world.No, indicators point down.

Edit: Also I’m a degenerate that’s why I got them so close to earnings if your risk tolerance is not that big get some late August, September ones.1140.50I bought my LMT calls back when it was $365/share. There’s no reason for covid to effect their business, they never should’ve crashed back in March. Still growing sales, still growing backlog, still delivering hardware as if nothing happened. But they were worth 30% less than Feb prices. Defense just isn’t sexy right now for a lot of investors.

RTX is a solid company it just trades with air lines now. I played them back at $52/share and will play them again if they can hit the 50’s again. After the election I will load up on shares

LHX is still undervalued I just saw better opportunity for NOC. If you like defense then they’re still a good play. Also Kratos is probably going to be bought out by LMT, I’m sure those shares and options are cheaper. Though they mooned today because of the Skyborg inclusionI know right!  Selling at open was the move for AZN.  

My AMD calls were up 250% at open.  They were 500% at close.How well did you do??I am but this was especially specific and baselessSeems like it’s always been doing well though might hop inYesterday morning and again eod yesterday to average down. Didn’t think it’d get even more rocked today.I will. Remind me next yearYeah, im parking like 10% in each got them low 15.30ish. it's a long term thing for me make money everywhere possiblePaid membership for only 1 month. Guess theyre only trading FDsAnd he's gonna buy on MondayTech really fucked a lot of us good this week.Shouldn't definitely hold until 100% gain or 100% loss, whichever comes first7/31 I was hoping to get the run up before earnings, but they barely moved. I figured I could get a continuation play after earnings, if ANTM bombs it first I might grab some CI puts.

Probably not worth it though.Both are fatFasho thx, thought so too so thinking puts MondayI’ve done a lot of research into the company, they’re a disruptive force in insurance. I was convinced enough by what I saw to switch to them for my insurance.VanguardSpreads let me be so much more retarded and still make moneyWhat kind of profit do you get? Been watching YouTube videos but on TOS or tda it won’t let me set up a iron condor reallyIdk but he put 2k in itPfe. LolI’m very bullish on LVGO, I own stock and have been buying options on every dipI think this has potential for explosive growth. Their business model is for patients with chronic diseases which make up a huge untapped market (~20 billion for liver, another 18 billion for kidneys). It’s also only offered in the United States so a lot of room to grow. I’ve been accumulating shares since it was $50 and will continue to do so. I’ve been buying calls a few months out and have been averaging down every red day. I started doing this when it was around $70 per share. HAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!! Also Teledoc Health reports their earnings next week and its expected to be positive, which could boost this stock as well, since virtual health has become more important in this pandemic. But my very bullish price target has this stock being anywhere from 400-500 in 1-3 yearsIf I’m charging $100 day surely they can’t be shitty people... right...RIGHT?!Hollllyyyyyyy fuuuuuuucckkkkkLevel 3Yeah I bought some gld leaps. Kicked around a bunch of ideas, but that's the only one I could think of with a good chancePoor guy just wants to be twitter verified. Lol. He was shilling for the blue check mark like these jamokes shill for a flair.I have seen 8/5, 8/12, 8/30 (rh), 8/7. Hope next week they confirm when it is. My calls are 8/28.Expiry will be same day ofcOh fuck for sure it will. Probs gap up to 270. It just kept stepping down I couldn’t do it. Paper bitch hands I tell ya. I stuck my L into WMT for a bigger L.September? Easy win.8/7 $135 callsCOVID will shorten my life even if I don’t get it. DepressingLoses or gains a GM market cap per hourThink I should dump the 8/21 ... ? It’s down big and I have 13 of themCallsLike???Haven’t seen it but probablyI like oncology space. Still have VBIV. TRIL and MYOV. But was hoping to catch another one before it blew up. I guess the data on July 30 will let us know if GNCA has legs. I don’t like chasing (could’ve bought back in past couple of days). I know it is getting pumped a bit

Edit: data release on TRIL expected sometime soon. Bought a few hundred more shares today and have a mix of $5 and $10 strike August calls. Hopefully data next week. Company should be double the priceah i see, the good ole double dick smackdownAh okay. Would always get roasted on Monday morning but probably more so because I was buying AAPL puts two months too early...Are you basing this on something that I can obsess about over the weekend or just a random guess. Give me something, anything.Sleep in, make some breakfast, try not opening the 🅱️eekend 🅱️owLmao nope we are honest over hereApple tendies didn’t come through this week. If my 8/7 400c prints I’ll upgradeSo we are due for a red one 🤡Yeah I think today felt like a bearish setup for Monday.

Bear flags and downward trend since Wednesday.My puts hope soRinse and repeat.

Can’t wait to see it in person.Fuck it worst case I stop out Monday and try againMore than fucking?

Cause I’ve been hoarding actual goldYes I figured that. Not 2 weeks lolFine, but only if they throw another one at the Federal Reserve while they’re at it.GrossThat's exactly when metals sky rocketChart is identical to when we've sold off bigly in the past. We broke the major ma that we've been trending up on since March. And the fuckers in Congress haven't passed any stimulus. Monday is gona be a 3% down day or more. Easy.Nothing of value was lost.Employers have had the upper hand for decades now. I'm rather old and I lived through the 2009 crisis. I found that they were nakedly offer half of the pay that they would years past. I'm assuming entry is now bent over a barrel because more kids have degrees now plus outsourcing. 

My best piece of advice is to fight fire with fire. If they low ball you start to lowball the world. Don't eat out or do anything fun. Make them feel the pain when the revenue isn't there.

There's always two sides to every transaction. If they're forcing you to take an L then you shouldn't reward them by living that lifestyle.I'm curious as to what happens long term with the $600. It's almost like a defecto UBI. And one that isn't backstopped by anything but bonds or government tax power. 

I can't see them raising taxes in the short term to cover it and it's unlikely a wealth tax would help. Alot of wealth is on paper. Even if we were to tax Bezos for 97 percent of his wealth it's not like there will be enough buyers willing to pay sticker for his shares and property.I said thread. Lots of ad hoc examples of what's happening for jobs with degrees rnWhy would you wait for stimulus...then VIX will go bye byeDamn haven’t heard of it till now, looks legit. I’ve been trying injecting test cypionate once a week for almost four years. I’m 22 now but I’m only on it bc I broke a testicle when I was 13 lol.

How's that for a lmaoI’ve seen some stuff that says next business day so I guess we’ll see.Honestly it’s hard to say if it will or won’t break out again. I just know VXX likes that $29-30 support and it looks reasonable that it’ll pop back up above $31-32 this week which should yield some tendiesSame thoughts honestly. Especially if earnings disappoint. Also I thought msft crushed earnings and we see what happened to them. Amd hit ath today, they were like 55 precovid. Hard not to see them fall off a little.Sometimes you need something very specificOh it's real easy to average down, check this out:

So you buy in at $10 CPS on Wednesday, since you have free floating cash and it's down a little. And then it drops, so you sell a few other dog positions and average down to $9.50. Some losses, but that's okay, it'll go back up.

And then Thursday happens and it completely shits the bed mid-day. Fuck, now your super cool can't-go-tits-up call is ATM instead of ITM. But... resistance? You look at the historical trend. QQQ has support at 255, if it goes lower everything has to be on fire. And we still have a week of tech earnings to go. The worst is over! It has to go up! Stonks! So you sell all some other positions for moderate gains (I had fucking **INTC put spreads**, r e e e) because it's obviously just a little baby dip before the big green earnings boom. And you *gotta* buy in before power hour, because you gotta ride the ol' pumperoo.

But... It does not pumperoo. It does not pumperoo at all. And now you're down $7k. But this is the bottom, for real this time. Holy shit, $5.50 CPS, as cheap as this call was last week! A savings! So you dump your GE LEAPs and your ITM F calls and try to catch the falling knife. And now you're at maybe $8.50 CPS.

And then you hold overnight, because with AAPL, FB and AMZN earnings coming up, after a dip like that, "dumb retail" is going to buy back in (and we aren't "dumb retail", no sir). Sure, futures are down and Germany is dumping, but they're just doing what we already did, so it's priced in, everything's Gucci.

So you wake up 5 minutes before open today, Friday. And shit is not good premarket. Shit is not good at all. But I still have some backup cash in the ol' piggy bank, good ol' TDV and SPXL. So... I could cash those out, but let's see open. How bad could it be? Maybe green by lunchtime!

And then it's 9:30 and I gap down $6k. Hrngk. Check the call, check the call, HOLY SHIT, $2.89 CPS, LAWD JESUS.

Okay okay okay, SPXL is looking kinda flat, let's dump that shit, gotta average down.

So you dump everything, buy as much as you can (at $3.80 CPS because you're not a computer and you have no chance of getting a good bid in), and put in one last comedy limit buy for $3.30 because that's all you have left as a rounding error. It's not going to execute, but it's like... a middle finger to the market gods, or something. Yeah, that's right, come down here and grab my paltry offering, you fucks.

And then you turn your phone off because otherwise you're going to look at your all time chart and you won't be happy. But, lo, a Robinhood push notification! "YOUR ORDER TO BUY 1 QQQ CALL EXECUTED AT 3.30". Oh, fuck.

And then you're out of things to liquidate, sitting on 37 calls for QQQ that expire in two weeks, and praying we have one green tech day before Theta gang guts you like the Tauntaun in Empire.

tl;dr - I'm down $13k this week, bagholding [37x QQQ 260C 8/7](https://i.imgur.com/P4nPPEo.png). I've seen my all-time go negative a few times. Whatever you do, don't be like me.  


If you want to learn from my miserable performance, take the advice I obviously couldn't follow because I'm a dumbass: **Until you're sure it's going up, it's still going down.** If you want to average down, do it 10 minutes after open or 10 minutes before close. Watch the volume, RSI, MA and EMA on the underlying stock. If you're not sure, wait. Better to catch a rising wave than a crashing one. 📉Thanks! Gonna give it a shot.Like the fedbois can’t get around that lmaoooooooo

Even though they are way behind on their processes, they are still the juggernaut in the semiconductor space and they still have very profitable lines on their 14nm/10nm nodes.  If they were foolish enough not to partner with TSMC, it would take them at least a decade to bleed out enough market share to AMD to kill the company.Same strike, different dates. Sell the short dated one, buy the long dated one. Use profits from the long dated one to buy back the short dated to avoid assignment or let the short dated one expire so you’re left with a cheaper long-dated callIt’s a way of reducing cost for longer dated options. Reduced risk and profit below strike, but “infinite” profit potential if short leg expires worthless.

Edit: instead of buying 2x 7/31 AMD calls for 5.08 total, it cost a total of 1.10 for 2x 8/7 calls.TSLAHa!Same bro. Worthless or profit.  No in between.I still have my aapl 9/18’s too.

Don’t take this personally but That actually kind of pisses me off. The trading days since early June have been anything but easy and all I’ve been doing is losing money. I’m down 87% all time no matter what I do. I can’t figure out how something is going to move because I don’t know any indicators. I don’t know how you ppl pick correctly and no one will fucking tell me. It really pisses me off that I can’t win.Just dm me your plays next week 😂❤️I got you.I also wanna lose weight tho and when I go to taco bell I can't help but order like 4 thingsHey PAL, I hope you a fantastic one.IM BACK BABY

FIST ON CHEST NO FEAR!!!!!!!!

T4P!!!!!!!!!Yeah I get that too, losing money really doesn't matter and neither does making it. But take out a couple thousand so you can hold it in your hand, I guess that can help you realize its a lot of money.Shares was probably the moveHang in there dude!The fundamentals are too good at this price. Even if AMD had a great quarter Intel remains a money printing machine for years to come.Yeah that’s the addiction part of it. It’s a similar to drug addiction and I’m a former/recovering drug addict. The high from making 3k and 5k in a day for the first time from some crazy options plays was comparable to hard drugs for me. It doesn’t feel the same now and I’m getting more or less numb to being up or down a couple k in a day so in theory I would need to go bigger and bigger to achieve that feeling. I have other things going on in my life now though and I’m able to recognize the thought patterns before they play out so I’m being a little smarter with my investing.how tall are you? why the switch up.The opposite brotherI try to give advice when someone asks or is being dumb but I definitely contribute to the filler shitWhy?

Account gewt da fuck outta hereaaI'm confident that while the government continues to kill the USD commodities like gold and Silver will rise. Other than that your guess would be as good as mine.Yeah but way more risk than you need to take for a small difference in gains homieYou're gonna lose all that moneycalls on my social life 😎Where I come from it’s both thoughAyyy, nice!! My buddy used to live at Lytle tower. He felt about the same. LolDamn, I don't use Apple products, but $220 for earbuds is highway robbery. Definitely going to beat earnings considering how many people wear those daily. Stand corrected, you could probably find an ITM call at that price haha.AirPods Pro or bustBut they only have two options for iPads, at least at my local Walmart, and if you have to wait for fulfillment they're losing their edge. I've been shopping for tablets recently. Checked Walmart and Amazon, plus direct from the mfg. Even on the website Walmart lost out in every way. BUT, before I made my big money purchase, I popped over to my local Walmart and bought a cheap-as little tablet to test what I wanted to do. 

I don't know much about Walmart+ TBH.Amazon has 112 million members of its Prime loyalty program in the United States as of December.... That's pre COVIDPls don't... I have November callsYeah take that metric shit elsewhere.« We don’t use kommunists miles in America! », he gurgled, before cashing-in the cheque sent to him by the federal state to all citizens.Not bad at all. I enjoy bullit.Lol someone downvoted you for that. I’m not big on bourbons but I enjoy a nice angel’s envy.. woodinville comparable?Nothing, just working out, drinking champagne, bbq and shopping. I have a surgery coming up in a month.Right so in 7 days we worry“You have SPY calls expiring this week”https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-consulate-houston-backdoor-idUSKCN24P2OTSpider-Man memeWould not surprise me, and then we somehow turn it massively green> or at a minimum worthy of life

Probably not, thoSounds like you need to learn when to take losses. Set up some hard limits for yourself and stick to them.F that's the worst lolStates exited lock down to produce this dollar fall. some interesting numbers though.Only?Power puffI don't lose sleep over options anymore. Once I started seeing the contract price as my stop loss and only trading with what I could deposit every month, it became more exciting and less anxious to watch my account balance look more like a series of higher highs and highers lows than like that M. C. Escher painting with the upside down stairs.Every morning waking up at 4am EST like...

https://youtu.be/labWIzcsaQQCould be the Costco factor. I have seen trusts instead of white claw a few times and it was always bc it was what Costco had. Like weekend boat trips or BBQs where you need to stock up on hot dogs and platesWhy not just buy amzn calls?There are many more weekends till Dec, not sure why people are giving you shitYou're probably safe then with that time period. You know AMZN is going to run before earnings.The only stamps you'll be able to afford are for food.My puts bought near the peak of retardation did just fine..which one? you and i will go broke trying to get to each of his mansions.

if youre a gay bear, go find his printer. we gotta burn that down firstIf the S&P 500 goes below 200 we’re due for some real conflict which could lead to thatYeah, bank and airline LEAPs are a good play if you can dodge bankruptcies.I said i want a fuckin LITER O COLAI consider myself an open-minded skeptic and have followed UFO, paranormal and occult lore for entertainment for years now. Bob Lazar is an interesting case but I can’t give him any more credit than all of the other ufo-nuts out there.

Personally, if we’ve had any dealings with ETs in the past then it was wi-fi and B-2 tech and then they split. Several instances where ETs offered the world a chance to get in on the fun and we failed to meet their requirements are in ET lore/history. No reason to think we’d all of a sudden be able to join now.🙏🤑🙏You'll get a second chance at it then! Although, shit man, if it pumps before earnings, you gonna gamble on holding them in this crazy market where beats go down?I hope u learned from
This 

And u got 3 years of 3,000 tax write offsNiceOk, but promise you won't bet your whole portfolio on any one.

SPY 29 Jul 322 Call

SPY 29 Jul 327 Call

And a bunch of AMZN, GOOG, EURN, GLD, SPY stocks. 

I'm up 21% this YTD. I have made a couple day trades on TSLA with much larger portions of my portfolio, but never over night.Yea, after the 85k to 61k I switched to theta gang primarily. Then this week I got cocky and bet 4k at the top[basically this](https://memes.getyarn.io/yarn-clip/4752f605-f3c9-409a-9997-6ff65f179a2c)Basically, but could have done better with setting it and forgetting it in VOO. Oh welPlaying the long con. I like itOh god, this will be me in 10 years.Well doneYea huge in Europe.When I was in India/se Asia everyone used whatsapp. Met a few Brazilians that also only communicated through WhatsAppFull Self Driving technology upgrades for $48m this quarter. They are years away from the reality, 3 years at best.Whatever life choices I made, at least I didn't get a yellow car 🤮Last I saw her on here was when someone clipped her "anyone know what stonks to buy" insta post back in March and then we cratered the next day lolYeah, that's more of a side theory for me, I think the euro banks are likely the main culprit if we get a big crash in Sept/Oct - just saying the dems probably have the most to gain from just watching the world burn until the election.Been holding 8/21 puts for a while and they go bye bye 😕More Qe ain’t gonna do shit for stocks. If you actually think they’re gonna do infinity Qe you should go all in TLT>  we cannot let china win. 

are you 12 ?

You need to look up what gives the US real economical power... it's not the stockmarket, it's the acces they provide to the reserve currency of the world, the USD. And unlimited printing will undermine that power. If tomorrow Oil and minerals start getting traded in Yuan, Yen and Euro, the US loses most of its vast soft power and just becomes another asshole superpower with a big military it can barely afford, like Russia.

[even Trump admin knows this](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/we-want-a-stable-dollar-says-u-s-treasury-secretary-mnuchin-it-is-the-reserve-currency-of-the-world-and-were-going-to-protect-that-11595512747)

 *“We want a stable dollar,” Mnuchin says. “The dollar reflects lots of money coming back into the United States… it is the reserve currency of the world and we’re going to protect that,” he said.* 

if the market "crashes" (\~correct -30% to some more appropriate valuations ) very little bad really happens other than some Boomer retirees will need to work longer or withdraw less...US companies will still be just as strong, just with lower stock prices, which does nothing for the actual performance of the business... most of the money will flow into US bonds of all sorts, not China.Exactly what happened to me. I was worried it wouldn't hold because SPY was being a bitch. Kind of funny too, by moving up my stop loss I was being greedy, but by being greedy and getting stopped out early, I missed greater gains.I sold at over 100% but it kept goingOkay so you play it right. I get so close to the money hahaThey were if you bought them earlier than this past week. If you plan on holding if you have leaps which might a while to print if they're too deep otm, then yeah they weren't that bad of a play.Silver, idk, as long as the fed continues to print money the value of the dollar will continue to deflate hence gold and silver will continue to rise so theyre good long term investments as stocks. Idk about as options w theta decay.RevisedI bought in late today, still hoping for a big runup8/21 is decent.. I hope of like $215’s? 

Those 7/31’s are risky.. but could pay offIf he goes ITM, I retireHmm, you're right. I'm going to do absolutley no other DD and add that one to my watchlist.LolJust 8. Something to keep me excited for mondayAh... TIL homeyAMZN has done the same thing 2 weeks in a row. Rallies hard on Monday, then sells off the rest of the week. Wondering if it’ll do the same thing this Monday.Nah, I think it bounces to 55 next week, holding thru AMD earnings at least to see. 8/21 exp so got a little timeYou gotta get your mind right so you can get the tendies during the week.  Weekend is the only time you won't have fomo.  Use it wisely.Congrats to you as well. Shits hard but we got it.Like wise 💪😤What state are you in?Just tired of the daily thread overreactions on price. Everything is mooning or tanking.Fuck the gators. Go dawgs.Disagree. I think MSFT will hit $220 by September. Lots of colleges are taking on contracts to use Teams and a lot of businesses are contracting to use Teams Enterprise, including the Big 4 firmsNeighbors blowUntil next time they call the cops. Just turn down the music bro be a decent human.That’s simply not true.  Cash is expensive right now, the dollar is rapidly losing value, which will continue as long as we keep interest rates where they are.Big factsYour jokes suckYou need to change your outlook on investing broskiTrue they cannot be blamed. Its built into the system and now it's not a level playing field. Social justice is asking for the level playing field with the same opportunities, privileges and reparations for being oppressed and not being able to accumulate generational wealthInshallah shaqiqWhat was the premium for those aapl calls?I’d wake up in a deflated bed every morning 😂. I also had my card decline at the store and couldn’t by ramen that day. Unfortunately they didn’t feel sorry for me. I’d buy the 5$ Safeway giant sub on Friday’s and make it last me the week. Fast forward and year and a half I got a six figure job and don’t have to worry about food for nowDon't worry, I can afford milk nowIt's not even like there's no buyers. There's 16 rn. If my math is correct these calls were worth 0.01 yesterday lmao. That means if you bought 100$ worth, you'd be sitting on 600k provided you can sell all of them.think about it too, the only other hard lemonade on the market at the time was Mike's Hard. Bet you they sniped a shit load of their profitsFor now, yes!

But this will continue for months (June and July data supports it), we are just at the beginning.I'm glad I signed up years ago.   That would single handedly prevent me from signing up today.  Hate fucking people.“Buy the rumor, sell the news” seems to happen a lot. Earnings probably will be solid though.I got 10/16s that I got in at .65 because the .63 wasn't filling quick enough for my 25 contract order.  But I was off reddit today and I see it being pumped now. Wonder how much these autists are going to pump it next week.PE is 10
RSI is 30
Earnings were beat
Dividend in 2 weeks
AMD earnings next week
It might not hit 55 next week but soon.I did VXX calls this week. Dont panic if VXX goes down, just pick a good low to average down.🙏🤑🙏CA is super gay.The air you breath can cause cancer.No, otherwise I'd probably have access to a plant genetics lab :(I was fucking dead. Bought for 1.40, held for a week, sold for .75. The one that got awayall the blown up accounts. It was like the desk pop scene from the other guys. "They were so convincing!" LOL!No reason for gold to slow up. A new stimulus bill could slow it up, but this shit is headed to $2500 unless we get a vaccine soon and the FED stops printing.That's what you're buying..I'm sorry, are you trying to say that you learned ANYTHING AT ALL?Not for all products.

Imagine how much INTC sucked dick for AAPL to go ahead and say "fine, I'll just add a new business model"I mean they don't have those cameras on a heads up display for fighter jet pilots

But I get what you meannice one to choose for warrants, keep seeing that they're currently severely undervalued. wish i could have 50k like you instead of the 500 i have lol.These future tendies lookin’ good be a shame if someone FOMO’d into your position 👀"squirtle" 😉Just hold for now. Gold uppie today while the Dollar plummets even further. I have a good feeling for Silver next weekAlways remember: it's not a bad day, it's just a bad lifeBrah retails and big boys activities are down. Nobody is buying anymoreLook at NQ 1 day chart. Looks exactly like the beginning of the feb-MarchMicrosoft earnings were underwhelming, Tesla hit and jumped for most of Thursday but fell after cuz of China tensions and other shit, rest of the market fell with it. Also next week has Amazon, Google, And apple earnings on the same day, if they all hit, obviously that’s going to pump.My wife has been spending $10/day on Starbucks drive thru. She spent $0/day before the pandemic. I can't fucking say shit though because I'm gambling hundreds, and besides it's her retail therapy and she's been getting the $600/week. But now I might say something and I might stop gambling.Well thats what i am betting on. But if not it wont be prettyImagine thinking you deserve a certain wage...maybe learn a skill? Maybe negotiate a higher wage?The bigger bubble this time won’t be MBS like in 2008, I think.  I have a theory it’s going to be auto-loans.  I know so many people who are currently underwater on car payments for a vehicle that isn’t worth what they still owe on it.  The banks who guaranteed these loans are about to get a wave of defaults when people who couldn’t afford to pay off their cars before all start failing to make payments and those banks become the bagholders of reeeeeeally poor investment grade debt.He did indeed.yep, he said he learned from 2008 crises and the US will not raise rates early.Thanks! Looks same as her mumLIONELLEOSo what’s the reason hmmMonday will be better! Congress needs to stop fucking around and pass that stimulus. 🔨To you as well. Tendies be with youLet's hope so! It's always a gamble even in the perfect storm, lol.Because they have a real chance of falling down to AMD’s price a few years ago. Also their only realistic save at this point is to get TSM to fab their chips for them which means that either way TSM will be the better deal. Also, such a recovery will take far longer than a month. Keep in mind as the US deals with corona and Intel falls even further behind on fixing their problems, TSM which is based in Taiwan, which has handled corona spectacularly, has been running their R&D and factory expansions at full capacity.God I wish not. But things are looking pretty uglyIn expensive areas like urban centers or coasts yeah sureOh god not another FOMC. I have done nothing but lose since the last one jesus fucking Christ.Fucking time travelersRoger. Have a little experience but am new to wsb terminology. Appreciate the answer.

Get him!!Great usernameI’d like to see it cross 126 for confirmation then I’ll throw 1700 in calls at itDepends, how stretchy is your anus?I'll go job hunting with you I need a new one for septemberThe dollar is more than that but I think companies are still a contributing component. That’s why I said in a round about way. 

And I think you can Invest in the dollar. Just not how you’re thinking. If you could then the dollar would fluctuate waaaay too much to be a world reserve currency. It would also leave us susceptible to external manipulation be hostile states.Retards gonna retardHow could you buy 100K of contracts without understanding the concept of IV, or, quite literally, the meaning of IV, before entering that trade. He should be king here.these retards aren't smart enough to buy deep OTM, most of them buy extremely shallow OTM on margin because they see a pattern lolok yeah I might check that outYeah, that one was really bad.

Earnings are AH Tuesday. 
So I hope they run up until then, so I can get puts.You gotta hit up Zimbabwe for the real returns


Just stacking FXI and CQQQI mean the riotsIt’s over and now they’re getting evictedI sell options, I could give a shit but you’re wrong to think that’s what is holding up this marketBut I don’t think everyone is saying earnings are going to be bad$35 is a great price for this lesson tbh...

mine cost me $3k (snap puts at $6). seemed like a good idea, but i shldve inversedWell we’re going to the moon on Monday man, don’t fret!Sentiments for ER? I'm SUPER bullish long term on AMD. Used to be Intelgang but been using AMD for my builds and they've just been knocking it out of the park with CPUs. 

That being said, this has been a crazy run-up and so I've got puts ahead of ER next week. Hoping for a pull-back and then gonna go back in on LEAPs or somethingPentagon acknowledged we have aircraft that’s not from this planetSchools remained closed throughout Fall, which must have explained the correction for the last 2 weeks lmaoYeah these things get sketchy the further away from 10 they go"...with the most beautiful diet coke.

We coming back down to 52-56Subscription service to just log into their app.According to RH, < 10%I was super leveraged so it would be life changing money had it gone up 5 or 6 dollars.  It was hard to give it up but needed to lock in some gains.Nothing surprises me anymore. I am considering using a magic 8 ball and scrabble tiles to pick my stocks and decide when to sell them.It's been fucking me for weeks.I'm at 50% now, if I sell now I'd consider it a 50% loss lol nah I'll probably sell soonI didn't find a good entry. I expect up next week, but I'm retarded.It might run a little on monday if we are green market wide. But that shit is coming back down to earth after earnings.And I was convinced after five minutes in the sign up process that it’s a meme.  Progressive did the same thing and is probably the worst well-known insurance company around.What are they offering that's differentOh man I don’t even remember that they have a trading platform, I think of them as an investment instrument producer and manager.Not much but I have a small account. I play the 2dte contracts, aim for $125-150. Do that for Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Just don’t fight the market I’ve left cash on the table if it starts looking badDang that’s wildWould pay $100 a day to destroy a Model 3.That's such a low amount for the risk involved plus during a global pandemic. Why bother unless you have money issue or something?The ones by me rent for closer to $200 a dayI had people offering 500 a day for my uncle’s Ferrari and Teslas to rent, but every single person that asked was someone I wouldn’t trust with a 2002 SaturnAh cool. I don’t even have Level 2 lol

Is it worth it?Previous earnings were 11/5, 2/5, 5/6, so I'm assuming it's sometime the first week of August. I know what you mean though, 40% of my portfolio is stacked with 8/21 and 9/18 callsThat’s what I thought too but it’s been all downhill the last week.What’s the Breakeven?Till we make a fuck ton of money and fuck off on some island where everyday is fucking models and snorting coke. gotta grind to achieve that dream, another reason why weekends suck--i need to buy calls dammithow big is big? whats your strike and cost basisDoesn’t the $80M pipe suggest it does?Also any thoughts on IMMU?Don't matter to me overall, I prefer green, but if we're red I'll buy back my covered calls and sell more puts. I'd just like a green Tues and a sustained rally so I can get assigned on about 35k worth of covered calls and free that upBro let me know what’s up I lost 2.8k this week, didn’t realize the trend was red this week, kept thinking it go upMahomes couldn’t even play the entire season last year because he was already getting hurt.

Personality. You are missing personality.Etf. Sold out around me for now but I'm looking around for physical.Just curious 🤗relevant usernameWhen the manger tells you “ I’ll be honest with you we have done a lot down sizing recently since March and are trying to hire back top talent”. 

My old manger also called me asking if I would like to comeback to work and that I’m 1 of 3 people out of 15 that they would like to hire back. 

I straight up told her find someone else.Agreed, I can't imagine an increase in taxes or even an increase in interest rates, that would crush the market. Although, one thing does come to mind, remember Elizabeth Waren's tax plan. I think it was 2% above 50m. It could be a possibility, but at the same time, there are endless other solutions.A thread in /r/Economics is not "worth a read" and economists are bumbling idiots.Exactly, bagholding a vixx call when stimulus passed. Money will go bye byeBetter price point for the next pop.Gotcha. You’re just following the trendMaybe. I'm trying to visualize it. It really depends on what rims you're using and so on.👿👿👿That may be, but I couldn't tell you whether Sisqo was alive or dead today.

However I am expecting a correction next week which will be short lived though. Same also for Gold.

However in the long term, bullish trend will run.haha fuck off, that's good for me.Thanks, I’ve had far too many cracks and heartache along the way to make thatYo lmaoWait til you hear her voice... she’s a singer. Hot AF. “Melim” is the name of her bandBut but but .. AZN is in .... naaah neva mindWhat can I say I know what I likeHa maybe on a good dayDown about 30 dollars.

There were deep otm calls up like 65000%If you bought puts Thursday morning youd be up 500%My dick will also be 1500% in your assFck that. Saved 75 per cent of mine and tightened my budget. 
Free time > overtimeI think I’m just gonna keep finding stocks like these and throw 1k at each one leaps and just let them explode like volcanoes throughout the months. It’s more fucking reliable than playing this market I swearNice I got 8/20 70C, might be fuktNah 7/31. I guess you're planning to hold thru ER?Yeah that's a big position for me on speculative shit. Too bad it's priced 2x typical SPACs.

Think the most I'll do is like 300-500 shares. Enough to sell eventual options on them hehThat's true. TD was giving me issue and I have to call in or download ToS

Ill add a few hundred shares next week and try to forget about them. I can buy on Ally and Fidelity but I decided to wait as I want some buying power in case weekend throws some interesting curve ball to the market.Monthly active users should be the highest on record and future outlook will be very bright E commerceDude they have been spending like crazy 9B cash deal for stake in JIO 400m on GIPHY the integration with $SHOP whilst everyone else cutting back

Their main competition has been banned in India and soon maybe USAI’d probably sell and switch to some 205-210 callsThey'll most likely beat. I'm just not going to deal with them.It's money I can afford to lose, not a yolo. There's a share split or something in August, you get one American Outdoor brands for every 4 SWBI, so I'll see what happens with that. Earnings are September, should be good.PM me if you want I’m like a fake lawyerI mean, I’m not a lawyer, I just know hostile workplace is a way to prove harassment. You can’t sue on the grounds of hostile workplace. And to sue for harassment you have to be a legally protected class to have a chance. And arguing who is legally protected group is something I’m not knowledgeable about as a white male.I’m in 😂😂😂😂hahaha I love this sub.  When do you know to cut your losses?  Especially when half this sub only trades FDs and you can lose 50% in a day.  If you go all in every time, or even if you do it 10% of the time, you're not going to last a year in this market.  If you go all in on leaps you'll probably be fine.This. If you're YOLOing just make sure you cut losers and don't buy expiries too short.No stimulus till week after next, good luck w that bro1420 what? No idea anyways lol. In both bear and bull scenario stock should retrace some of this leg down

I think it will consolidate in some channel and volatility will start contractingreason?Yeah...dude asked for a potential 10 bagger. Lol.Yeah that’d be wild. Do like September.:oSo a Folex keeps time a little better and I only have to reset it 4x/year? The compliments I’ve gotten on my Shinola are worth the money alone lolChoose a close strike and Just keep rolling the date out as you gain tendiesSame bro, I love everyone of all colors, but sadly not everyone agreesGotcha. I'm bullish with theta. Trying to be bearish = get your account blown up lolExactly ... less dip buyingI think we are in agreement...Wow. I invested 2k. If it goes above 40, I’d make bankNice. I’m still up pretty nicely too with a couple months to expiration on my calls so I’m feeling fine all things considered. Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely should have sold and reentered because it sucked too losing 30k+ a day for 4 days in a row.Dude are you ok in paying 3 or 4 times more for tech? That's your answer.That’s the idea. But Sichuan, Guangzhou and others would. Split the shit up. Same with US. Better for everyone.China fluIt still could have been, but should have played it longer. SLV still has a lot of upside so keep your eyes on itI ain't playing it. I've learned that it's nearly impossible to make money one way or another on NVDA earnings lolStill overvalued imoIf you share, a care, we'd probably get marr-ied.Not exactly. Unless the IV of the short call increases bigly relative to the long call, and the stock moves aggressively ITM, it really shouldn’t go against you if the underlying moves towards your strike. If these calls were months apart then it could. But being weeklies, the short call has a similar delta to the long call, but a much higher theta. So time decay works in your favor. On Thursday, my MSFT 7/24 7/31 210c was up 70% that I’d bought Wednesday. Even though MSFT dropped from the previous day, I profited because of the IV drop and theta decay of the short callThey count double!double pointsSadly I blew up this week lol so I'm sitting on the bench for a bit so I don't actually blow outYep. Time and a placeYou gotta catch a pull or two every now and then in the V8 though it’s only rightUr momBought Wednesday, expired today.

They said it drops 5% whenever it hits $58.

Chart matched up.

Reality though, fuck dude lol.Polls are really unreliable right now. They use RV screens instead of LV screens. Also with cell phones it's hard to find the LV's. I don't see a different outcome from 2016 right now.To be fair the north East has been relatively successful in keeping the virus numbers down for a whileNice90% of the words are 3 letters. Imagine thinking that was "top tier literacy"I hope so I've got callsYup I'm talking about youNext levelTrue. It’s been trending lower for a bitDepends on whether your broker charges a minimum fee for processing options contracts and what the price of the contract wasMake money? No.

Options have intrinsic and extrinsic value. Intrinsic value is what the option is worth if exercised right now. The extrinsic value is the premium, which is determined by your Greeks (mostly theta and vega).

The option you bought had an intrinsic value of $2 per share when you bought it (price of share - strike price) and the extrinsic value was whatever you paid for it above $2.

The option now has at least $1/share less in value because the stock price went up $1. Theta or time decay will also cause it to lose extrinsic value. Vega could increase or decrease depending on whatever deity you believe in, but doesn't mean shit at expiration.

Edit: I realize you asked about at expiration specifically. Edited everything like 5 times to fix it.

At expiration that put is worth price of share - strike price. So $1/share.You'd lose money but not all of it. It would still be worth $100 at expiration.So, I have been selling since it was in mid 30s. Have had to cover most weeks and then resell, but strike price reduces as well. Definitely making a few hundreds every week. I also sell calls against my shares hah, and have diagonal calls too - selling aug call and bought sep calls.It was deleted LOL clearly was fake newsMurcia, España?🇪🇸Lmao the one closest to me is fort CampbellR    E    N    D    E    R    S

Syeahlets not get ahead of ourselves but given it had a +16% run up, some pull back is expected. Profit taking plus being EOW also has to be considered.So many burned before the reverse split lol

Up huge the last month but no reason it won’t continue if jpow keeps this shit upSome stocks only offer monthlies. Other than that not sure.But you said outside 🤔Thought I was being smart by switching sides for a quick buck.  I was getting lucky that whole streak,  to be honest I had no right having all that money and was a dumb ass once I had it.   That realization the next day though when I saw what happened was crushing.  I don’t think I ate for 2 days. Literally made it on coffee and water.  That old saying don’t cry over spilt milk is true.  I’ve had near misses since then and they are much easier to get over now.Good. Rule #1, don't buy shit you don't understand. No shame in asking questions and getting that knowledge though. But this isn't the best place for brand new beginners to be honestThank youI like this. Thank you.I think about that every day. Every single day, after every single loss. Doesn’t work for some reason, makes me want to make it back even more.I just wish the gym wasn’t closed :/It's not about the EOD move it's the intra-day. 

I don't try to meet everyone's expectations when I take time to post and make sure everyone is doing well.  I do the best I can and know it won't be good enough for everyone.Nah something else. Basically I have lived with a chronic daily headache for 2 years including various neurological symptoms. Google CSF leak if you are interested.Imagine paying for 3 PHD’s when you coulda just been literate trash and make 50k. /sYou really love Dix. Teach people to use it then. it is not predicting a market collapse on Monday like people are saying but I don't see you disputing those comments.Thanks for explaining, usually all my best posts get downvoted and shit on by salty retards, I'm all for  accountability

WSB tattoo chalk it up for Monday.FYea they’ll sit in my Roth it’s for a whileI'm sorry, my brother.  I think you're worth loving.  I love you, but not like her haha. 

Maybe do you need to work on yourself first before you're in a relationship again?sure thing bud. Sign up for a few of the internet dating websites. pay the subscriptions. It’s a numbers game. Worst case it gives you a sense of perspective. women can sense it. not claiming to know anything about women, but smash as much ass as you cant go wrong. You will regret if you don’t. Maybe you even meet woman you love more. In the meantime she is getting dick every time she wants it. And a lot of the dudes she is banging this weekend aren’t half the man you are. They are just scumbag internet dudes on this same website like us. And buy some decent quality hookers on eros or whatever local mid tier equivalentGot mine set for September coach am I gonna make it?Got mine for Jan 2021Yeah last night was pure luck. TSM just treats me like a good sugar daddy. He gives me free money and I only get fucked sometimes.  😉

But for real just holding your money until you see stocks rise with momentum and just try to hop in, some run ups last 2-3 days and its always great to have the cash to jump in instead of being tied down by something mediocre. I was in the middle of swapping brokers for the last 2 weeks because I got PDT banned. Missed the crazy ass price action on TSLA. Just don’t feel like you ALWAYS need to be in on a position. Be a sniper, don’t spray and pray.

EDIT: I feel like this goes without saying too. If you have good profit, take it. I sold my TSM 67.50s at open today at 71.40 a share. The share price almost hit 77 an hour later so I could have made a shit ton more. But 100% profit is fucking bonkers on one trade. Theres always more trades in the future when you dont diamond hands you account into the ground.I kinda just said easy because if theres any time to make a load of money its right now with the way the market swings. Im with you on the early June shit, I just about got wiped out with mgm calls in early June. I’m not gunna sit here and say I’m not lucky with this I just want to share my “sort of” strategy/mindset. In no way am I skilled or nearly well informed enough to give professional-grade fiscal advice.I would but if you lose money I’d feel like shitWhen in RomeHere’s how I lost a fuck ton of weight. 2 good meals, 1 cheat meal. 

Skipping meals doesn’t count as a good meal. 

Basically I ended up cheating every 2 days. I think it’s doable and I went from 230 to 180 like that🔥🔥🔥👊👊Thanks manAbsolutely. Intel this week was the same as when BA or DIS dropped under 100. Won't be there long6'2" liked my 27.5, but rode it less as i got more out of shape. i had no need for a downhill bike given my fitness level when i started riding again. decided to get a hard, tail just more practical/useful to me and still pretty comfy offroad. never compared the weight difference between the wheels, but i feel like the added rotating mass on 29er makes it a little slower than a  27.5 when it comes to direction change. maybe just in my head, idk.Damn you didn’t get the 60C 7/31 for 0.01 this morning? I loaded up gonna be a massive payday👁👄👁They want to see your RobinhoodI'm in Oct 7c8/21 7$I like your positivity, thx brother.YessirUnless the market opens up -3% I'll be fine. I'm not going to hold for the whole week. I didnt get the cash to gamble 90k on calls without at least knowing somewhat what I'm doingExcellent. I meant this for OP but I'm glad to hear itWell, I'm not from Kenya.Your point? You ever heard of competition? By your stupid logic, HBO should’ve stayed on television and never launched HBO GO as Netflix had millions of “loyal” subscribers already. Get your head outta your ass or you gone be broke son 😂Ok, for you I will keep thru December Xmas shopping. Then I'm outVery high end. I pass angel’s to get this local shit so maybe I need to compare. I don’t know yet. Downvotes mean nothing.i doubt someone would yolo their last check. lol.Right, so when they re-enter lock-downs the velocity would decrease significantly just like it did last time, which is deflationary. Or am I missing something?

Furthermore, outside of stock speculation, debt repayments were the largest use of stimulus bucks, and in a credit-based systems such as ours, that means that the principle is destroyed, so both M2 and M2V both go down. If Americans do that again with the next check, which is the mostly likely thing they'd do, then not only are they not increasing the velocity, but they are actively decreasing it with credit-money destruction.

Despite the best efforts of the MMTer's to will it otherwise, at some point the system becomes so overloaded with debt that deflation becomes inevitable. The only choice is between a controlled demolition or an uncontrolled collapse (as was 1929)

If ET’s were making trades with us would it be safe to assume they hold some sort of value in Earth? I mean what would stop them from theoretically just coming and taking what they want, burning the planet down and moving onto the next galaxy?Im holding three contracts, 10/16 $4100c. Bought them at different times. Up on one of them, down on two of them. If it pumps before earnings (which it fucking better), ill probably sell two hopefully for a profit and just hold one through earnings. After eanrings if shit goes south, ill roll into November or December calls. 

If there is no pump pre earnings, well then fuck me. Ill prob cut my losses on two of them and hold the third. So strategy doesn’t change.😂Yes I don’t bet my entire portfolio. Tbh, I have quite a large portfolio myself, al of which is stocks, I just have some spare cash which I thought I’d play options with.Did you buy calls at the top? Btw, what’s a Hubers57?LolAhhh, thank you!If you think that is long term you are a jokeThey can do more and yes, they can do infinity qe and if they did, I would not go all in on TLT as that isn't the best play.

You've go to be extremely simplistic to think that's the best way to play a low interest rate environment.

Go ahead, fight the fed though. Really no point arguing against any person who doubts the fed.As long as u did not lose any money you still good but I know it sucks leaving money on the tableAll it takes is one bad dump for it to wipe out all my gains though haha.The theta isn't that bad at all on options out a few moths plus. I definitely see it continuing up with the fed policy. Silver and gold popped on EU stimulus news, and with US considering more stimulus that could push it moreYou think it’ll be pumping on Monday too?The 8/21s are 240, stupid I knowhow much would you be making if it hits 90 next week?Agreed. A lot of people seem to be underestimating how many campuses will be online this Fall. Microsoft thrives in that scenarioBut they’re not going to dump into this highly volatile market right now. Everyone talks shit about Buffet but look at his mentality. He’s hoarding a bunker full of cash, just waiting for the bargains.I need to be coddled through this cold world.30.55. TSLA is my least confident trade as I fear it has some gaps to close back in the 1225-1250 range. Will see.That’s a good turnaround though. Amazing how you can go from rags to riches. Everyone had their own pathThat’s the kind of shit that keeps me up. But usually when you see it being .01 before, a lot of the time there was an MM selling the option for like 2.00 and there’s no bid which usually defaults to .01They killed earnings and props to them. Wish I had even perused any companies outside of tech with earnings this weekHmmm...  what do you fuck then?Hopefully enough to make me richVery solid points, but PE will only increase when the competition is stealing the marketplace and you have to rededicate a huge amount of cash to catch up to the competition from a technologic standpoint - $$$. Did you get in sub $50 or right around there?

I'm gonna keep my eye on the shares play.You talking about Cali or Austin? I can't tell.It happens. There will be another. Just gotta find it.Gold is a really crowded traded now. Could easily pull back 10-20%.Volatility is symmetric from a pricing point of view, though.Yeah, stonks only go up usuallyCan't disagree with that!!Most of them have sept and Oct expiry. I have also some leaps. Long term plan was to roll them over, I just need to reduce exposure I think. Didn’t have enough cash to buy today’s dip in techtsla never rlly depended on sales/retail for their valuation... they just need to BS some growth story for the goldfish market to think "ooooh growth tech company... buybuybuy"I thought the same thing about ES a month ago. But then it just went higherAuto loans and Commercial Real Estate.Dey 🐐smm I picked up some $55 Jan 2021 calls but I might scrap them theni dont know if its gonna happen soon but i got a good feeling that's how humanity is going out

that book "the road" really fucked me up. I think that Cormac really understood the depravity of humanity. 

the only differences between wsb and the guys running around eating people are tendies and timeMarkets been abysmal since Jpow spoke that day. Hate when this fuck speaks.I got into iwm recently. Will look more into it.I like that!Dude you’re gonna get me banned shhShould see a couple nice days this week, I’d guess. Once we have a couple green days. And once we cross that line it, there’s a lot of room to run!126!?!?  It’s got 🚀🚀🚀. Can’t lose. Fuck it I’m in! Can’t go tits up now.  Stonks only go up!  ↗️🌙lol posted this at my job actually, but only part time since I’m a broke college student •.•Aaaand?Might check it out actuallyYou can’t do this with 1.5 k.  You might be able to buy a single monthly QQQ strangle, though.fair enough, i guess I don't have any connections to illegal shit so i automatically went to stuff that's easy to get loldude... spoilers.It's likely they got it scripted or planned ahead so they know what they will say while the guests come in blind & expecting a thoughtful conversation.

Any of us could be blindsided by 5 questions for every intellectual  retort that we invest actual energy into.

Even worse is that they'll just say something like "That's bigoted" if they're backed into a corner, and before they could explain why they're upset they'll move on to the next 3 questions.

It's why Joe Rogan's format so popular.You happen to know a decent broker for Zimbabwe?Hey man, if it does, I’ll discoed call you and we can have a shot together via discord. Good vibes my contract friend.I been holding it for 8 months shit never stays above 59$ 


I don’t trust itAMD will be worth 200$ + eventuallyCmon, I don’t think it’ll pass 60 by Fridayautomatically applied to all accounts.Perfect the odds are in my favor then :)I rode AAPL and MSFT up and got out only to dump some into TSLA and NFLX....might as well have just gone outside and burned my money.Exactly what I’m saying lol. Mfers would walk on it for the ‘gram like it’s a runway bruhExactly what I was thinkingWasn’t thinking about doing it rn. Just figured if I could make 1k a month from it that it would be worth it.i think level 2 is free on webull....... Nice way to track order flow for day trading or when to make entry.Are you holding through earningsgoddamn I need to get back to work, reminded me what I’m working forI have not looked into this one, but will try to read up over the weekend.Trend was definitely Flat/ Up until it reversed EOW. Looks bearish to me but who knowsHow would there ever be any greats if you say that about every qb. You could've just as easily said that about Brady after he got injured for an entire season in 20085th richest person in the world:( 

YouTube bitch no excusesI have a GT350 that I bring. We have a ton of different stuff that comes to ours, from old MGs and classic Ferrari’s to new exotics. Always a fun time.And in some ways taxes might not resolve the underlying social issue. We have a significant imbalance of labor in America. we have people who barely work and earn hundreds of thousands at a desk job while people toil away in the heat. there's no way to really compensate them for all the hours that they put in without sentencing Des workers of the same kind of misery.Agree with economists. They are idiots but honestly the comments are a better window into the opaque world of hiring.Yup following but not participatingBro I didn't think anyone knew 50 was alive until the will Smith thingChick-fil-A is the best. But 10k maybe just for franchise license, how you gonna afford the monthly lease? If you put down for a lease contract I will open a Chick-fil-A.DoubtKinda hotWith the way the markets moving right night, that might be the best bet.Don't count yourself out, analysts are pumping it. Just saw another article come out that was very bullish on it after closing bellNah I wasn’t that’d be too much theta fuck. I just wanted less volatility in case thing go south it’s up 20% tho so maybe I should’ve bought 7/31 lolNot a typical SPAC tho. No 20% founders share, no huge discounted promote up front, $20 floor (if they don't make a deal) and a tontine warrant system wherein you don't get 2/3rds of the warrant if you decide to sell before the merger (and those warrants get distributed to the remaining owners).

Basically, in this one you're in on the ground floor about as much as you can be.

Edit: I think word is going to get out about the huge difference between this SPAC and all the others.I really hope so brother. My calls need it.At this point I'm just trying to time the. Est point to get off these calls.They’re not gonna beatWouldn’t be surprised to see people dump AOBC.Calm down, you don't know any better than I do.  I think if the market goes down any more, they'll push it through early next week.  Congress goes to recess in August.  Regardless, I doubt we'll have three red days in a row.  My bets are placed. We shall see.Prob gave him like a 20 there. HahaI couldn’t believe he broke his arm last year because it required him to let a motion reach the floor.AUY 8/21c $7 and SLV 1/21 $21... I could use a winnerThink I got down voted...would love to hear bear case? Maybe its just someone with moderna calls🤷‍♂️Right on. I felt the same way, but at the same time, my conditions for sale had not been met. I’m in it for the long haul.Yes. Absolutely.Yeah I’m not looking to play earnings just looking for the run up next weekA thousand times 

I refreshed to be 

1st in line

To flair theeUr dadSo no Pulitzer Prize?Interesting. I think I might go this route myself for other stocks. How long have you been doing this if you don't mind me askingThey lecture soldiers in AIT telling idiots not to get these car loans - though they do anyways. Then let the scammy for profit “universities” run the education centers on bases so they can take in all the GI Bill money, lol.You would think that but someone was trying to convince me that it has another 9% to run up Monday as wellLmao I thought going somewhere indoor was impliedRunning and cycling are good options too. And homeworkouts.Sorry to hear man, be wellBy the time I see any price increase by momentum, it’s usually already or near the top and about to fall tho. What did you use to find those stocks and follow their action? What metrics or benchmarks told you to buy calls or puts? I’ve been trying this since March and all I’ve done is lost money. I’m down 87% overall and nothing I do works. Nothing makes sense. Or when it does make sense Murphy’s law kicks in like this week and kills me. I should have been green this week but then silver and gold got dragged down.So if i understand you’re strategy/mindset, it’s basically:

1) buy end of day sell at open

2) buy based on action right before close. I.e. if it starts moving up kinda quick in the last 10 minutes of the market, buy a call

3) do the above with higher volume stocks (I.e. stocks discussed a lot here), since you can use that momentum for the by at close sell at open strat 

Is that correct ?Order tacosgotcha, not much of a mountain biker never enjoyed it compared to just road riding. I may get a damane SL6 (maybe 7) soon. I live in a super flat with no good trails so I think might just get a good road. Working at a trek dealer helps too.Ok I’ll bite. Why will they moon on earnings when everyone else is taking a major dump with a few moons here and there ?Shit gotta make the next weeks money somehowI yolod my account today because I thought it was gonna get changed to 400/ week.... not month.   :(.  Still got gonna get another 2k, but yeah.Good link imma watch rn. The flip from deflation to inflation is def nuanced. My perception is the new lockdowns won't last and won't be nearly as severe for wall street or main street as the first. As far as deflationary pressure my thought is that it primarily depends on the global printing of money and dollar denominated debt. If the us prints more than others the flip will be quick.I bought 10k in September QQQ calls between yesterday and today. I'm with you man, hoping for a nice week upcomingThis has a thousand answers. Everything from “they do business with us at secret bases like Area 51 and Dulce base,” to “they’re part of an intergalactic treaty that prohibits harassment.”

Until now the only source we’ve had about any of this is either from a group of disgruntled Air Force personnel or several decades of psychic housewife testimony.

If they’re so advanced, they’re harvesting stars, asteroids and unpopulated planets, no need to impede a developing world.I think that's a solid strat. Hopefully we scavenge back some profits!Nah I had 7 17s on that June 10 week I was already up big in, that 5% drop day after a couple little red days destroyed my positionsFor real tho I was 100% cash up until yesterday afternoon. I’ve started nibbling back into some Apple and FB positionsHow is that fighting the Fed? They’re buying billions of dollars in long duration bonds every week. If anything, going all in bonds is actually following the Fed. Why not just buy what they’re buying?Well, the thing is I lost a good amount of money with puts on AMD that, due to theta, were sold for a loss even at the bottom of the AMD dump yesterday. I had also bought those calls at the top of yesterday, so I didn't get in at the bottom like some others here. Overall, it ended up being a wash. The extra 1k would have helped me a LOT because these last two weeks were brutal. So yeah, the trade itself made a profit, but the series of trades up to that caused it to be a wash.I know man haha I love myself some condors. Shit had been flat lately and I’ve been getting more and more willing to move towards the moneyMaybe, maybe not. I'm betting that it will though.All it takes is one or two decent green days and they should pop a bitYea TSLA I can see it going back to reality at $1000Na don't try to make yourself feel better. You were probably getting that contract for sub 1$ lolJill, my right hand ( gal)It’s a small play, I have 3 calls I averaged down to .78 I’m currently at break even. I got in at about 50.5

I honestly didn’t listen to the guidance and am just playing the technicals. But I heard it was bad, they could put out some better PR, especially while AMD is doing their earnings next week.I’m ready for it brother20%? It only dropped 12% in March. 20% would require a catastrophe. Gold is just a currency. Gold isn’t spiking so much as the dollar is crashing.Not this time look at the dollar valueMessi is godThere’s a bunch of much safer and potentially profitable trades out there imo. The risk to reward factor is abysmal because even if it recovers it’ll probably hit $60-63 in best case scenarios a few months from now. And that’s reeeeeeeeeeally stretching it btw. Much more likely to just stay flat or even dip more.I’ve literally only lost money since then. I don’t know what to do. How about you?Why don’t you wait a year or until you have a quarter million dollars in capital until you trade options on futures?

By “low capital requirements” he means that the value of the underlying contract he is trading options in is currently ~$75,000.  Futures and their options are highly leveraged, *e.g.* /RTY is a 50x multiplier.I can sell a /RTY .20 delta strangle a month or so out for like 2 grand and it only holds 3-4k in buying power unless it moves against me.Forget the paper trading, You only learn with cash.I’m cash gang this weekend and this looks like the perfect play for next week. But I want it to cross 126 before I go balls deeplmao like you said, a casinoand I was only half joking, because while obviously hard drugs have limited benefit, there is a lot of evidence that limited psychedelic use can be beneficial to depression and purposefulness/connectedness.Joe Rogan will just let you grind yourself down on your own opinions and very calculated interjections to play to your emotional side. A lot of people fall into that trap and its hilarious to watch.I’ll bring my sombreroThat's the spirit!Use a stop-loss lolHmm yeah I don't like others using my car but I mean if you barely drive why not i guess. 

Depreciating asset and all thst. (No matter what Elon says heh)Interesting... might have to look into that. Retarding on RH over here. Thanks for the replyIf it gets above $66 before earnings, I'm probably going to sell half. Mostly the August calls and keep September calls. If it stays below, 💎 hands...what?  I said QB’s that play LIKE HIM don’t last.  Brady plays nothing like him.What state?That's funny but it has truth to it. I previously worked in an IB and HF, there were many aspects of the job that you don't really need a degree to be able to do your job. At the same time, the learning curve is steep for certain things, so education does justify the difference in money that people earn.> he comments are a better window into the opaque world of hiring.

It's a bunch of redditors sharing anecdotes about how they don't get callbacks. It tells you more about the people that use reddit than it does about the world of hiring.Well no one's seen Sisqo since '98 and his one hit didn't come out until 2000.Actually Chick-fil-A covers literally all startup costs except for the $10k fee. In return they take a larger cut of your profitsOr you can google it like I did you absolute retardThis was cuteHopefully, we get a pump and pre-earnings run-up with nice IV spike, lets see I got time.

Appreciate words of supportYeah you're right. Everything is as investor friendly as it gets. Ackman isn't in it to milk even more from fees like typical SPAC sponsors. Dude just wants to score a win for the prestige imo.I got off my calls awhile ago. They can stay at that 131 range forever.Me neither although wouldn't surprise me if they pick it back up after the earnings in September, I might try some complex strategy based on thatYes I do. Congress has session scheduled through August 7. Don’t expect a deal till the last minute. Its only how it works every time everNot diamond hands but smart hands. HahaNow go ahead and convince the lakishas and cletus of this world.

You can't only pick the good parts of a cheap labor shithole without expecting that shithole to start growing into an overfed global octopus.You'll pull out your hair 

For a flair 

Is that fair?

Most wouldn't care 

Dare? 

Me, nah, I can't compare

I have a flairYou found him? How long was that line for cigarettes!?The dark side of capitalism always makes me chuckleMonday might be a stretch. Tuesday could have another run up though, after earnings.Thanks dude. Appreciate it. You be well too!A lot of the stocks on my watchlists I get from here just because people hype them up. TSM though I got from looking up ASML when they launched this big promo video back in like January and it was a recommended stock that competes with them. Also, I rarely ever make money on puts. People meme that the markets are rigged because they sorta are.  Idk if you tried to play earnings or not but a lot of people here get hammered by holding their positions through earnings instead of selling the day before or earlier, i’m sure you’ve heard “buy the rumor, sell the news”.  Limit your market exposure too. Although I do make money through momentum stocks most of my profits come from the buying in the last hour of the day and selling first thing in the morning. The less time your money sits on the trading floor when prices swing like crazy the better. You may miss out on that phatty 10 bagger but a 3-5 bagger is just as nice.Exactly, also its sorta nice to learn how to read candlesticks. Not really as a means to base your buying off of but sort of a good metric to see how things are moving.bro that thing looks like a screamer, nice. seems like a no brainer if ur livin in the flat zoneFirst earnings since their IPO and supposedly have made a major shift to e-commerce. Obviously not a guarantee, but they have a lot of room for growth with not too much downsideThis guy's wrong. Nobody's gonna learn anything from the pandemic and won't save money. There will be insane borrowing at 0 percent. In fact I think people learned the opposite lesson. The government will print a paycheck if anything bad happens so they'll gamble on fds.[deleted]Amen brothaFb calls you mean?Agree, certainly possible after this run up.Damn it this is all I have hahaMessi is a pantheon he created the godsI lost 11k in unrealized gains this week on 2021 Spy/qqq calls 😂😂Trading options on futures is *not* for the novice and you should *not* be painting it as simple and easy.Yeah I’ve never done paper trading. And learned many lessons with options the hard way as most have. I always lock profits regardless of the situation. 15% gains all day are completely fine with me because I can invest even more on the next trade.Didn't know that.PennsylvaniaHe runs the weekend Dow nowLol that’s just the franchise fee not the startup costOf course! I've been saying I think we see $65-$68 pre earnings. It should move next week. If not, I'm 100% holding through earnings. They're going to blow away expectations, literally everyone I know is trying to buy a bike/tread right nowI just need one decent green day. I've managed to keep my average pretty close. But I hear you, I'm done with this shit next week.Others have flair and so I stare

At all the fun while I sit in my chair

So please mod

Grant me flair

And then I’ll feel 

I’ve been Here like a WSB aireSo most of the positions you listed were buy at EOD sell at open? If so how did you know what direction they would go before you bought?I know how to read them but I don’t know what I’m looking for. What am I looking for ?...yeah it's crazy to ride, only bad part about all bikes is they're all back ordered until December this year.Will keep an eye on them thenIt’s just taken too much of a beating last few days. Has to be some big buying coming next weekYes I have some spreads that I turned into calls todayJust got to think of the next one. This one happened cause everyone is buying alcohol cause they stuck inside. If you think about it, that makes complete sense. Now what else makes so much sense...Messi created the universe and galaxyBetter than me. I haven’t had unrealized gains in weeks. Literally nothing but losses.You can define your risk just like you would with equities, but you're right. People should know shit like /es is 50xSPX so if they sell naked they can get royally fucked and I should definitely be more clear and cautious.No one ever went broke locking in profitsYou keep digging your hole, and it’s just continuing to show how absolutely fucking retarded you are:


Startup costs: $0

Franchise fee: $10,000

Minimum liquid asset requirement: none

Ongoing fees: Chick-fil-A charges a fee equal to 15% of sales plus 50% of pretax profit remaining, the company told Business Insider. 

It's also important to note that Chick-fil-A prohibits most of its franchisees from opening multiple units, which can limit franchisees' potential profits.

Chick-fil-A says this limitation is meant to enable its franchisees to be intimately involved in the day-to-day operations of their restaurants.

Average per-unit sales*: $4.2 million[deleted]Yeah, at least 12k came from TSM which is just a strong as hell stock and it was on a run so even on down days if it sold off quite a bit it just seems to return to above or just around where it the day prior. This month overall was just wild, in the first half you could just about count on any tech stock recovering from a drop. It’s sort of just intuition but also believing what you’re tossing your money at is even the tiniest bit predictable. When I shorted tesla yesterday for like 1.3k I was telling myself I was retarded the whole time. About 2 mins after I sold the stock price jumped hard af, I damn near lost 5k. I refuse to fuck with that now unless its on a retard run like it was earlier this month. As for holding overnight if you see a stock go near parabolic prior to close I sorta see it as it at least gunna continue a little into close and maybe the price will stick through the night and into open. Even if its a few cents to a dollar rise in price, hey its profit 🤷🏼‍♂️This is gunna sound really stupid. So the way I imagine it is the candle is a rocket ship 🚀. The candle is the ship and the wick is the thrust. So I may be totally wrong on this but from what i’ve seen before big jumps you’ll see little green candles with pretty massive wicks on the bottom. Smaller ship, massive thrust = big move. It seems if you see 2 of those with minimal or no top-side wick you’ll usually be heading up. Obviously the bigger the candle the better but large bottom-side price rejection is a pretty good platform for the price to go up. Alternatively with red candles I imagine top-side wicks to be like boulders, the bigger the heavier, which drives the stock down.  I guess the simple answer is just to look for good bottom-side price rejection when the stock is going down.DD’s haven’t really worked since the start of June. Seems like 90% of the time, stocks dump after earnings. This was a gamble unless you really knewput your bets in the optionsprofitcalculator . It’s Based on black-scholes options valuation model , you should look at that wiki entry. Don’t need to understand it but that’s the basis for how options algos autotrade . If you actually take a few days to study b-s and, learn what the Greeks are you will know more than 99% of robinhood users.If it’s only 10k how come everyone doesn’t own one?

Why be a chic fil a employee when you can start one with on a credit card?

LolThanks bro 
I feel completeFirst thank you for sticking with me and my questions. You’re the first person to really give me insight that makes sense. Like your example with the rocket ship. That example actually made sense to me, Though it seems counter intuitive. I would have thought a green candle with a much larger wick going down would be a red flag, cause that means the price is dipping down. But you’re saying that if that happens near EOD, it’s likely to rocket up the next day?
What time unit are your candles set to? 5 minute candles or what?

Also, earlier you said “ large bottom-side price rejection is a pretty good platform for the price to go up,” but at the end you say “ look for good bottom-side price rejection when the stock is going down.” which is it?That's true. Though this was an exception in the sense that they blew out the expectations. Didn't just beat it. But you're right, like I got delta calls before the azn news came out and that shit didn't move unlike the other times vaccine info was announced.Idk retard ask Chick-fil-A, I didn’t actually conceptualize their franchising agreement structure. But yes keep acting like you weren’t entirely wrong. You’re embarrassingNo problem dude, if any of this helps you out I’m glad. So I typically use candles for the shorter term stuff like 1,5,and 15 minute candles. If you’re using Robinhood you have 10 min candles only I believe. So what I mean by bottom-side price rejection is that the candle is showing resistance to the price going lower. I think a wick usually represents the range of that candles price action for whatever timeframe you have you’re candles set for. I believe a wick shows rejection on whichever side of the candle its on. So, if you have a green candle with a large wick on the bottom it shows that during that time frame the stock price may have dipped to that level but that lower end was rejected, showing momentary bullish sentiment.  So if you catch something like that at the end of the day and you catch it early enough then its possible to ride it into closing where, hopefully, it maintains that sentiment until morning.Depending on whatever index the stock is tied too it can change though with futures, sometimes it just powers through. I try to wait for an extra candle to get a better idea where things are going because if you go and look at some charts you’ll see individual green candles with bottom-side rejection, but then the next candle is red. However with price jumps you’ll end up with a couple of green ones and the wick on the bottom will sorta fade out as the price run up reaches its peak and you’ll see top-side rejections on green candles.https://thehustle.co/why-it-only-costs-10k-to-own-a-chick-fil-a-franchise/Ok I think I get it. So I would look for two, three, or more candles in a row with larger rejection on one side maybe...what 15 minutes before close? Or should I go as close as I can to closing bell?Are you trying to prove my point or something? LmaoYeah pretty much, usually towards the end and beginning of the day you get a lot more volume so it should be a little more obvious which way the price is going into close. Always look at the day chart and see what the trend is. Sometimes on days where things sorta dump you can catch calls on sale but try to watch the closing action pretty close, people like to abandon ship. I usually look for like the last 30 mins or so for the day, I dont think its so much the case anymore but when the fed was doing repo ops when the lockdown started you could almost always count on seeing a price spike one way or the other around 10 mins before closing. Also, I never hold over the weekends unless my options expire over a month or so out or I have a REALLY good reason to believe the price will go up in the coming week(s). Overall though it just seems to be way easier to make money when the market is bullish for days at a time. Trying to time the top is hell and has bitten me in the ass more times than I can count. We seem to be in some sort of correction/consolidation phase right now though. I’d say the next big thing coming up that could make pretty massive gains is playing the presidential election if you want to buy that far out. I believe Joe Biden is in the lead which, if elected, would probably make the market overall go down. Some people are saying that his victory is being priced in as we get closer, but just keep an eye out on the news. If theres a time to be a bear its Sep->Nov.Will try this strategy next week with smaller positions/observations. Thanks again man. First real god damn useful advice I’ve ever got since starting this shit.No problemo dude. Hope it works out for ya’!I bought Intel puts last night 5 minutes to close on whim from a random comment here. Not a good strat at ALL but I knew about Intel's current issues and have been long on AMD for a bit. Woke up to see the my puts over 100%. Love itI owned amd at $15 in 2018 and sold at $18. Bought HEAR at $32, kept it in my portfolio this year because I enjoyed the 2 year landslide of pain, then sold this yr at $5Man.. its almost like someone talked about this in a long ranting post that may or may not have been cocaine-fueled.Play Intel calls next week. Its going to gap up after AMD earnings reportMy portfolio: AMD puts and Intel calls+shares

It's gonna be a fun week next weekhttps://ibb.co/5LnfwCS

keep for reference to know how it looks when AMD squeezes up on days like this.It seemed to stay balanced most of the day too.Remember we all use to look at AMD years ago in the single digits$Made 1k this morning loading up on Intel at the bottom and selling puts. Cashed out a little earning, could have made 3k. Im thinking Intel has one more day of fading all day. Looking to buy in EOD Monday/ Pre Market Tuesday. Target is $48.15.If anything the balance of the post is going to swing way towards amd because they are so much smaller that Intel's shit show is a huge positive for amd.What this shows is that Intel future price chart will look like AMD’s chart in reverseWe'll see how long this lasts, then you AMD owners can get back to playing minecraft at your jerkoff station in your moms basement ...calls on intelNot the biggest bet, but I did it boys. [1,000% GAINS](https://imgur.com/a/kTAQ54w)My balls aren't balancedI'll give you 2 tries to guess which one i have calls for and which one I have puts for  clownemojiFucking love this subI said fuck it I'll go heavy on AMD 65pBought and held Intel from years ago at around $30.

Never thought it was good to buy into or even reinvest dividends into it, but picked up some just now after the 15% dip.INTC 4.23B shares outstanding x -$9.81 daily change = $41.50B withdrawn.
 
AMD 1.17B shares outstanding x $9.83 daily change = $11.50B added.

Lisa Su: "Where's the money Lebowski?"Anyone remember the homeboy the other week who called this?I'm confident AMD and Intel will trade places, AMD is the new King, byebye Intel.All this talk about AMD and no love toward TSMC. 

INTC is talking about issues with their fab process so TSMC should be the real winners.Would getting long intel calls be a big brain play8/7 60p on AMD. bought 5x contracts todayImagine AMD delivered their graphics card too...

Oh well next year ^^TMThis is the best sub on this GD site.  Consistently posting quality content.  No S..Bought a shit load of INTC today because we’re only at Infinity War not End Game. I’m just sitting here waiting to hear the snap for my tendies.https://imgur.com/a/Y6Z0BKw

tuh tuh\*How the fuck it perfect balanced, INTC less than 0.26.only 100% gain on a 15% drop? The premiums must have been crazyThey are going to think you did insider trading. Doesn't matter since it's worth nothing.It was probably one of my comments. I been bashing Intel all day. You can pay me in beer.Only 100%??? Should’ve bought more OTM I guess or amd calls. AMD 63c were just $0.07 yesterday at close. It would’ve been $6 today. That’s 10000% returnsIf it makes you feel better Hog Fucker, I was in amd at around 6 (can’t remember exactly but definitely single digits) and out at like 15% profitI've had AMD since $22 but only have 20 shares and never bought more. So pussy. UGH.Good. Sell your winners and hold your losers. This is what someone with no fundamental analysis does.Better than my guy that sold his AMD holdings to buy Blue Apron IPO at $10 a pop.I’m still holding Amd at $30 on my paper portfolio. Too bad it isn’t my real one.Link?anytime I see posts like this that is pretty much fueled on blind confidence, I inverse that shit.I went the boomer way and bought intc shares while they were in the bargain binSorry chief, my puts think otherwiseI hammered them calls today daddyyyy strictly off the -15% day. Don’t tell boyfriendToo late for that, will be up 4% Monday morningI sold a ton of AMD shares and Calls this week, and now I'm in your position, with AMD Puts and Intel $50 Calls I picked up on the cheap when the price dropped below $50...  Gonna hold my breath all next week, will definitely be kicking myself if AMD rockets into the 70s, because my plan is to get back in under $65.....this wasnt so much a squeeze as it was a liquidity crunch... wiping our faces with tendies tho.How mad are you?https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-announces-delay-to-7nm-processors-now-one-year-behind-expectations

Enjoy those fuckin' ~~losses~~ calls.

Let me know if you need to hop aboard a ride on the AMD Hype Train... 5 nm and Zen 4 together next year... Zen 3 this year to fucking crush Intel's gaming dominance in every single category... not to mention still the sole provider for PS5 / new Xbox. We'll find you a seat in coach.

These fuckers can't even get 10nm right and they were talking about 7nm, now they've managed to fuck that up too thanks to sheer incompetence.

If you want to piss away money, you should stick to drugs, whores, booze, and cigars - its far more enjoyable.Holy shit congrats dawg10/18 60p 10x. Super excited to get fucked out of $3k next week when WSB meme strength and fed fuckery pushes that shit to the 80s by EOW.Nah I said over 100%. I didn't register how much over because my eyes were barely open when I checked and I was shocked at the number. Was either 160% or 360% lol. I bought the puts at 2.26 each and sold at \~9.55 each

 https://imgur.com/2Sy3tkL3:59:50pm, niceNobody’s going to think you insider traded on that move aloneyeah I only made like 5K and wanted to take a gamble on these big drop days because I've been only holding stocks & they were getting hit. Randomly saw intel as an opportunity for puts.Can I come over for coffee?If it makes you feel better I bought AMD at $1.92 and sold ~$6.80. wasted all my gains on OTM options after that when if I held I'd almost have a millionImma be ultra real here:

Sell those off (~1350) and fucking yolo them into $80 calls exp 1/15/21

--

Intel is all out of good news for the year.

AMD hasn't even fully released the goods on their 4000 series, and on the enterprise market they continue to chip away at Intel's share with Intel doing fuck-all to stop that bleeding.

When AMD hits ~85-88, take the fucking win and go home.The reason I sold amd is because I started seeing the stock on this sub. That supercedes any faThis is the wayWhat is the point of a long term paper portfolio?https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbr1ol/get_the_fuck_out_of_intel_and_get_out_immediately/Not blind , it's pretty obvious. Look at the fundamentals , net income of Intel is 21B in 2019 and revenue is 72B. Net income of AMD in 2019 is 341M and their revenue is 6.73B. You guys are really retarded if you didn't buy this Intel dip after good earnings.Remindme! 7 daysOh dear. I'm afraid you're in for a nasty surprise. Even if AMD drops somewhat your premiums won't increase. And yes, it's just a matter of time before AMD goes higher so you're betting against the trend.None I cant wait for this to pay everyone in the Intel threads...I usually buy AMD computers too🤣That great news was the reason we were blessed with an amazing dealI doubt it. I think markets gonna be red next week during earnings weekEverything is over boughtCongrats on the big win, and also fuck you.I’ll be honest that does make me feel a bit better, at least you still saw a really nice gain thoughI forgot that I even had it until I saw the movement today.Love that the top comment is that the rant is bullshit and to not short intel lmaoBruh, it's based on future expectations.

AMD is grabbing market share like a hungry slut (not just in consumer PCs but also in consoles, enterprise, servers, etc), and INTC just continues to fuck up everything. It's honestly sort of amazing how many mistakes Intel has made in the past year or so, and they are legitimately at risk of becoming completely uncompetitive.

They basically lost 100% of the enthusiast/custom PC market overnight, and most of their revenue now comes from contracts with Dell, Lenovo, Apple, etc for desktop and notebook CPUs (and a few other random components, like wifi and Bluetooth cards). And, these companies will almost definitely be looking to AMD, as Intel's 7nm chips aren't expected to be available until *at least* 2022, and AMD is already mass-producing. Depending on how hard these companies ditch Intel, it could be an actual death blow. 

And that doesn't even bring up the issue that things are shifting more and more to mobile platforms, where Intel completely failed. Companies like Apple, Samsung, and Qualcomm absolutely dominate in the mobile SoC sector and managed to castrate a titan when Intel attempted to enter that market and failed miserably. 

It's bad news all around. 

Does that mean they can't come back? No. Of course they can. But the concerns are real.

What other major stocks have you seen recently crash 13% on earnings then just... Stay there? Flat? We are in the most legendary dip-buying market of all time, where almost any dip will be bought without any logic, and yet no one would touch INTC, which is one of the biggest tech companies in the world.

It's a bit concerning.

Your DD is basically "bruh, it's Intel. And they made a lot of money in 2019." But that's frankly just not very good DD my friend.I would but all my money is otherwise used

Edit: Will sell something and buy 10k of leaps on mondayThen go back to 2019 and buy it then, cuz 2021 sure as shit ain't 2019.Bought AMD puts and INTC calls today. Am I doing this right?lol, fundamentals.what you're saying is just pure exuberance. You don't know, and it isn't obvious. You do realize AMD announced a line of CPU on 7nm that have integrated graphics and will gobble up market shares in the workspace/contracts with PC manufacturers. When you have a CPU that uses less power and have better single AND multi core performance why would you stick with the competitor?. That's why AMD rallied 7% when they announced the line. Then intel announces they're 6 months behind on 7nm when they're already 3 generations behind AMD. Yeah intel made a lot of money, but investors see that it is slowing down significantly and momentum is all on AMD. Intel will recover, but to say it'll recover on AMD news is just not DD and I personally would not hold intel calls.  If AMD announces something major in terms of 7nm release Intel will get pooped on. Don't call people retarded when your play isn't sound.Goddamn that's what I love about WSB... endless hope in the face of certain disaster.Can’t  do simple arithmetic, makes thousands on options anyways like a true autistIt was my second trade ever. My first one was some Biopharma company that Shkrelli bought that went from a penny stock to $20+ overnight. I lost $300 in 15 minutes (which is the most money I've ever lost and so quickly too) from that play and then did massive DD before going all in on AMD (my dd came from me being a big tech nerd back then and not understanding why AMD was so cheap compared to Intel given their new CPUs were rock solid and being used everywhere for mining).Gaming is a tiny percentage of revenue compared to what intel sells to the likes of Dell and HP.  The majority of corporate environments run intel hardware. Always have, and for the foreseeable future, always will. There’s more to these businesses than just gaming benchmarks.you didn't need to write an essay to this idiot why his claim is total bullshit that's why this dude stay broke. can't think further past his own bubble.The custom PC market is the WSB of computers you beautiful autist, it’s a meaningless drop in bucket that is the market. Those laptops and corporate computers you scoff at from your 35 year old pillow fort are fucking 99.9% of the machine that is consumer grade computers.Intel is still king in consumer PC. There's a reason why their high end shit like i9-10900k is out of stock and gets resold on Ebay. AMD will never catch up to Intel's revenue/profit unless they make their own shit.About a year or so ago I read they hired the guy that designed the Ryzens. But I haven't been keeping up.Intel and consoles?I did the same shit brothaPretty much all modern cpu have integrated graphics.... and they definitely don't have better performance than Intel. Only thing AMD beats Intel is that they use less power , and lower price.That's why all of us love it...our calls extend through the year...if we lose I will single handedly deliver a hustler giftcard for your wife and her fat boyfriendand yet rewarded for it anyway.It was actually my first trade ever too, lol. 

I was like 16 at the time and just set up my TDA account and my dad had told me a few tickers to buy for the long haul, long story short I bought AMD and AMZN. After seeing 15% I thought I’d be a genius and sell it and find the next months 15% runner, luckily I’m still holding the amazon.2016 was a good year. It was the year of AMD, NVAX, and of course DRYS.That's why I wrote this huge post about how AMD beat Intel to 7nm chips by a solid 3 years, which puts those sales to Dell, hp, Apple, etc at a huge risk.

This is literally why their stock dropped.Intel is only king in consumer PCs because PC manufacturers like Dell and Lenovo are still buying wholesale from Intel.

If you look at actual sales of consumer-boxed CPUs, AMD is absolutely dominating. But, of course, this is a small part of the market. 

But again the issue is 7nm architecture. It doesn't matter what happened last year. It matters what is going to happen when Intel is literally 3 years behind AMD on 7nm.Because they have shit yields even on their ancient 14nm.Actually, making their own shit has been working out horribly for Intel. It’s the reason they have been falling behind. From what I hear, only a tiny fraction of the current 10nm chips they make are even sellable due to production issues and wouldn’t be surprised if there are further delays on 7nm.

I have no idea why people  (okay I do, it’s because they don’t know better or have really bad judgement) would play INTC at their current state because let’s say they finally do get 7nm going? And then what? Basically you’re saying the stock will go up when the their best case scenario is that they will stop fucking up and catch up to AMD. Also, they stated that if they can’t get their chip fab together, they do have secondary contingency plans to outsource chip fab. Guess who the only company that has the capability undertake such a task is? TSM. So why, why, why, would you want to put money into INTC when TSM is sitting there, heavily undervalued with huge growth potential, with much less risk.Hardly a fair comparison since the 10900K launched during a pandemic that is causing supply shortages across the board whereas AMD's 3rd gen Ryzen launched last year.  The upcoming 4th gen Ryzen will be a more apt comparison.he wrote an essay explaining you and you straight ignore it you retard. you didn't get his point. fucking idiot.Jim Keller? He left Intel in June for "personal reasons"Exactly, lol. AMD and Nvidia won that battle and create all the CPUs and GPUs for next-gen gaming consoles.

Just another missed revenue stream for Intel.Less power and lower price are THE  whole fucking competition in a lot of markets and Intel's not winning any part of the battle anymore.

I like to back my claims up.> your wife and her fat boyfriend

This is the one dumb financial decision I've never made. Just deliver the Hustler giftcard to my boyfriend.And Intels dominance in consumer cpus has always been in laptops. Desktop are a dying breed. Amd weakness was they had garbage laptop cpus but they solved that shit this year with renoir which absolutely destroys intel in performance and battery life.AMD is the single biggest meme stock ever behind Tesla. 

You’re not wrong about anything you’ve said. But that’s the point you’re missing. Intel still dominates the business world of computer processors through mass volume. It’s like comparing the quality of your local mom n’ pop restaurant to McDonald’s.

Sure the quality is probably better at the mom n’ pop. But nobody cares when it’s a fraction of the market compared to McDonald’s running game around the world. 

AMD might be the frontrunner... like 7-10+ years from now. But for now, he’s not wrong. Intel dipping puts it under its average trading evaluation of shares. It’ll go back up and buying calls for the near future is a strong and easy bet.

Saying it’s not just makes you guys the cornerstone of WSB honestly lmao. AMD has been hailed to have a meteoric rise in value all year, and now that it’s come months later, we’re tap-dancing circles claiming it’ll rocket “unexpectedly” like the next Tesla or Amazon as it supposedly takes over the computer processing market?

 The truth is, it’s still not going to be recognized for the value you all think it will anytime soon. Do what you want, it’s your money. Meanwhile, some of us won’t have to wait over half a year for a payout after being wrong and in the red for months, we’ll take the easy and consistent profits week in and week out, building a real portfolio.I'm talking about gaming. Intel's current 14nm chips still beats AMD 7nm chips in performance , smaller doesn't mean better.It is important to note that Intel's larger chips are as good or better than AMD's 7nm. AMD has to be *constantly* improving or they just fade away because Intel's brand name, performance and quality are so strong. They continue to be the premium option, and everyone wants the best even if they can't afford it. If you're buying for a gaming rig, you're buying Intel. If you're buying for servers, you're buying Intel. 

The trouble Intel is having right now might lead to issues down the road. But for now, and for the immediate future, they're going to show better growth than tech companies like Microsoft or Apple. This quarter kind of proved that. This is not to say they won't lose market share to AMD, especially in the desktop market. If AMD's new line is better performance in addition to the power savings, then people are going to buy it in droves because it'll almost certainly be cheaper too. But server upgrades are much less frequent, and Intel has time on those.When the boomer 14nm technology is still beating a zoomer 7nm technology in raw performance hahaha.Maybe it has something to do with the fact that INTC went down 18% from overreaction. I'm only in INTC for the short term gains. Why the hell would I go into TSM after it went up 10% today? I'm out of INTC once it goes up 10%+.I almost forgot switch existedConsoles are shit margin, that's why AMD takes them, Intel and Nvidia don't typically care about the business.And i meant that they haven’t had a marketshare to begin withThose chips hasn't even come out yet and they are comparing it to last gen chips. By the time those chips are for sale for DIY consumers , Rocket Lake or Intel's 10nm chips would be released.🤣🤣you win...still like my calls thoDefiantly not destroying Intel in the laptop market. So few laptops use them because the descisions were made a year or even 2 years ago to go with intel or AMD. Intel was obvious because they had been destroying AMD. Now though, in the low tier laptops and 2-3 mid tier laptops they’re pretty even. AMD is cheaper, but intel has better boosts and much better thermals which has always been AMDs problem. Intel right now is still on top and there is 0 completion in the high end laptop market and even mid tier stuff. Maybe in a year or two this would change but right now, renoir doesn’t destroy intel, it’s competitive wit intel.put intel cpu's are power hungry hot garbage. Its so bad that apple, a major laptop maker is no longer using intel cpu's and instead is switching to arm. So seriously, what r you saying.

Only reason theyre still surviving is because of their sheer size. amd cant produce the volume that they can. Its perms of performance or efficiency amd' beats them.Well I'm not making an argument about gaming performance. I never said "AMD is better for gaming."  I just said Intel lost the custom PC market, which they did. 

Intel basically had 100% of the enthusiast/DIY desktop market. Now they have about 7%. Custom PC folks basically completely switched to AMD Ryzen. 

As for 7nm, smaller does mean better when you are a laptop manufacturer. And companies like Dell, Apple, and Lenovo *will* switch to AMD to get smaller, cooler, more power-efficient processors for their ultrabooks and whatnot.on single core performance for games that primarily use single cores. You know why games like WoW are never tested? They tend to use more cores. As developers begin to use the capabilities of more cores, this is going to change. Oh and the difference is by 4-5 frames.

\*Edit\* also, Intel uses way more power to hit that performance. 1.3V in a 10900k pulls over 300W while a ryzen uses 210W at 1.42V. Can supply sources>If you're buying for a gaming rig, you're buying Intel. If you're buying for servers, you're buying Intel.

That's just not true. AMD now has a majority of CPU sales in the enthusiast/DIY PC market.

I'm not saying you're wrong. Intel's best chips are more powerful than AMD's best chips. I'm just saying that everyone is buying Ryzen anyway, because they are good enough and far cheaper. 

7nm isn't about gaming rigs. Gaming rigs are a tiny fraction of the consumer PC market.

7nm chips are smaller, run cooler, and are more power efficient. This is critical for laptops and ultrabooks, and I have a hard time believing that companies like Apple and Dell will just wait for Intel until 2033 when AMD has these chips now.Intel's benefit is what is screwing them. They manufacture their die in house, which obviously reduces overhead but this could lead to falling behind which is happening. People bring up that intel current chips are as good or better, but at what cost. Usually it's power consumption and integrability. Used intel for the past 10 years and had to swap out motherboards for almost every upgrade. You can use the same motherboard for the last 3-4 generations of AMD chips, including the ones that are coming out. AMD used to be Intel in the gaming community but that switched with the release of the Core 2 Duo.Amd beats intel in all price points. And no i dont care about an extra 5 fps in games or slightly faster single threaded boomer app.The thing is, you don’t KNOW if it’ll go up 10%. Chances are bigger that it’ll gap down over the weekend when overseas traders bail the fuck out on it. Meanwhile, you could have been  holding long calls on TSM which will almost certainly hit $100 minimum in 2021 and probably more.  

Now let’s say TSM drops due to profit taking over the weekend. All that means is that it’s a great time to buy more calls.

If INTC drops down over the weekend? It’ll just continue to plummet at open from everyone ditching a stock with abysmal guidance.TSMC started mass production of its 5-nanometer N5 node in April 2020.Intel still dominates the DIY market , it's not even a competition. Where the hell you get that 7% from?Obviously Ryzen uses less power since its 2 times smaller and Intel still beats AMD on multi-core performance. Intel's boomer 14nm architecture still have better bench performance than AMD's 7nm which I find funny. Now imagine when Intel finally learns how to make 7nm chips.I think Apple is moving to in-house silicon anyway, or they want to. We'll see where the consumer laptop and notebook market goes, but it's quicker to change than something like servers. If Intel gets their shit together, they can eliminate this competitive advantage AMD currently has. It's a big if, of course. I like to think it's not blind faith, and that the company has proven itself over the years.I'm just saying that as Moore's law slows, the difference in generation becomes less important relative to the difference in design/performance. If Intel's chips are comparable or better even when AMD has the size and power consumption advantage, what happens when Intel *does* make it to 7nm? I could be wrong on this, of course. I just have a lot of trust in the brand name.It doesn't need to go up 10% for profit , people that got in at $50 is already up 2% , and that is free money. You also don't know TSM will hit $100.Look at Intel dropping and AMD increasing in market share:

Where are you getting your info on Intel dominating from?> Obviously Ryzen uses less power since its 2 times smaller and Intel still beats AMD on multi-core performance.

Uh, no. Here are the top multi-core scores -- try to find an Intel processor:

https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/multicoreYou're right, as die size decreases the benefits also decrease. Intel current plan is to have 7nm released by late 2022 or early 2033 and AMD plans to announce 5nm by 2022.  We'll have to see then if the performance is equal. I like Intel, no denying they were/are great, but AMD lighting a fire under them is a good thing overall for us consumers.You’re right. I thought it would hit $70 instead of $100 but my leaps already printed a month after I bought them so deep in the money for TSM leaps that I was scared I wouldn’t be able to sell them and have to exercise instead. Luckily I was able to sell them for the current asking price at the time instead of the bid side of the spread.Everyone has different numbers. Steam said only 22% have AMD CPU and many other sources also said something similar.Worldwide. Why you posting stats from a German retailer?True that.Desktop chips have inferior design since they're recycling skylake (remember 6000 series? same shit) but laptops have moved on. Reason why i9 has performance crown is sheer clockspeed which is the one thing their 14 nm is good at. At more moderate speeds though, intel is a little bit faster at gaming but significantly slower most other benches (that's per core and AMD can easily manufacture more cores cheaper). It is true that moving to a new manufacturing node with good yields will fix their problems though, since 14++whatever++ is only good at maxing speed on top chips and is behind everywhere else.That's because there's still a large number of people running 2+ year old Intel CPUs and are either going to hold on for a few more years or are waiting to upgrade since the Intel CPUs then were still better than AMD's (especially the i5s). Market share is based on recent CPU sales, which, like u/StockDealer mentioned, is almost exclusively AMD. I would not be surprised to see a significant change in the Steam hardware survey results once 4th gen Ryzen releases.steam is user based not hardware based. Many users can use the same hardware and it gets double recorded. Same reason why the 1060 is still top of the list despite production ending ages ago.Because it's a legitimate sampling from a large retailer. I noticed you haven't provided ANY source to back up your claim. Where is it, or are you just operating on feelings?

EDIT: Guess who owns 1-5 of the Amazon best selling CPU's too?

https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Computers-Accessories-Computer-CPU-Processors/zgbs/pc/229189/ref=zg_m_bsnr__bsThat's the one that everybody uses for sales, just fyi.

Tell us more about how Intel will dominate.TSMC started mass production of its 5-nanometer N5 node in April 2020.Plus the Steam survey has gone up (in AMD's favor) even since February:  https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/processormfg/

2% doesn't look like much -- but in five months? And that's not just new processors, that's all processors.Now to 140k!! You got thisHow many kids do you have?

Although I do see your point.Same. My 2020 chart is going to hilarious looking back.Only if he sell, next timeFuck the way, the empire is grabbing trendies while you Jedi scum fuck with the force.I was actually out for a little bit at the top, this is a number of plays since February or thereabouts.You're my spirit animal, or maybe I'm yours. I trust MSFT but it doesn't stop me from losing my mind. It isn't right.It was just open seasonU can see it, to see how long it takes on the way back to homeI have a death wish.I used to think my life was a tragedy.

But, now I realize it's a comedy.You know what sub this is rightI am independently wealthy.  This is not my bank account lmao.Extreme luck.It started with a TSLA call I bought for 1k that turned a 20k profit after that it was rounds of puts during the crash and then a few bull plays during the recovery.  The recent chop is what killed me.Hydrogen infrastructure is shit compared to electric.He would have said exactly this.I made a supersonic man out of myself.The environment for making this kind of money with relative ease is gone and will likely not come back for another 10 years (next crash), sorry to say.  We might crash sooner depending on the world situation.He never gave upMake this man a mod.

This is amazing.You mean on the way up and downcall options lolIts make more sense to gamble itWsb cred?I was cash and lost it on other plays.>You guys do a lot of advanced shit I don't understand

Jokes on you, NOBODY around here understands what they're doingI'm hoping to eventually get that $3I to $10k after posting a half million.Oh you are for sure challenged.You pissed away $70k for a challenge?It was a prank bro.Call it “a guide to bankruptcy”Amateurs, 230k pissed away😂A better challenge would have been to make it keep going upSo, you like to be mentally challenged?Yeah sure budCan I participate in the part where you lose money to me?That's my kind of edgeThe good old rope a dope! Sec will never catch on if you lose 97% randomly then build it back up making 1k at a time!This guy fucks.What'd you buy for the 1k to 70k?Do you think saying shit like this makes you look less retarded to us?Watch him come back -$140k lmaoNice!Consumer confidence doesThanks, Autistic Einstein, we all can fucking see the pattern.So more than you care to know :DLooks like you were a victim of Gandalf Raping Day several times over the past few monthsBro my account is the opposite of yours lol.

Much more charts and lines lolYou clearly have never seen the amount of charts poker players have.If you’re dumb yesSeriously though if you cap 100k, take 50k out and buy some blow. Or save it. But that would be sound advice, and sound advice is illegal here.Glad someone realised the pattern...you need to get good at reading charts my boiMade it all on puts during the crash.  SPCE, UBER, SPY, CCL, and M were my favorites. INO calls.  Did some work on the way up in SPY, APPL, and TWLO calls.  Lost it all in the chop as I was pretending to be a day trader and not just someone who got insanely lucky a few times.

Forgot to mention: I started my account with 10k to see what I could do.  Got down to 1k in January and YOLO'd on a single TSLA call which netted me 20k in 2 trading days.  That was the seed money for that first round of crash puts.Now he just needs a once in a century pandemic to help get those price movements.I always go for the YOLO. gets me from broke to rich every timeIf you didn't transfer it into your regular bank account is it even really real money? 🤷‍♂️Lots of MSFT? My calls are down 68% over 2 weeks. 

I was like "Yay they beat earnings!......Why is it plummeting? Well surely tomorrow they'll bounce.....ok, down again, tomorrow we shoot up!......Damn it."le sex number xDr/redditmomentNot sure if the technicals support 2k. It's forming an autistic wedge. If it crosses this plane, it could fall as low as 29 centsHe's got it right. Why are yall so math illiterate? Oh right, sorry forgot what sub I'm in.His trend is the only one that makes sense... 10k — 1k — 70k — 2k. The trend is that the odd sequences (1st and 3rd) are multiplied by 7, so the 5th one would be 490k. And the even ones are double, so after 490k is 4k.

These kids cant fucking hang with my mathsDid someone say Jenga?Found Eminem's real reddit account, boysYes. But he does indeed get the screenshot in this scenario, right?Its not adding $70k each time, its 7.0x. Otherwise he would've been at $80k instead of $70k.

$10k to $70k to $490k and then keep multiplying by 7.

1k to 2k to 3k to 4k etc.

Fucking morons on this sub.You numbskullYou are poorSee you in about 10 years08, 2020, we're bound for more in the next 20 yeatsRight so to you 70k is just a play thing, thanks for solidifying my point lolUnderstandable.

Also, no idea who's downvoting ya, but you deserve better.I mean which one mainly? tesla?I didn't realize this was your whole portfolio mb and sorry for the loss. 
Im a pussy and only have dividend positions I find these charts you guys post fascinating and scaryThis is the best fuckin joke ive read all dayI love this sub.I just laughed so hard I farted.Yeah if the challenge was losing his ass he definitely showed themAren't we all?Hahahahahahaha.....I love this fucking sub! I love it so goddamn much!HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA I ACTUALLY LAUGHED OUT LOUD. good work, brotherLolol mentally challenged for sure.  LolI’m sure that’s what he has to tell himself in order to not jump off a buildingShould have pissed on some masked strippers instead.The challenge was getting every retard in wsb to believe this is realStaying alive is a challenge I guessI passed away 2X that amount and still standing.  Don't mind them, they will all be singing the same song somedayNah. He's getting ready for 140kI was only pretending to be retarded.So far only 8k is pissed away lolDamn sorry. Have you posted loss porn?I think also more than he can affordOh shit Whitest Kids U Know reference!But wasn’t that the one day where they stopped raping Gandalf?Kevin, I couldn't decide between a fat joke or a dumb jokeAndy you're even gayer than Oscarr/unexpectedofficeRoast boysIf you really want it. Yes> [now it's our money.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2019/10/16/billionaires-have-a-lot-to-fear-from-bernie-sanders-tax-plan-infographic/amp/)Correct. It's DD at that point.I amI turned 30k into 80k then withdrew 25k, just to blow up my account now I have 12k. 100% glad I withdrew when I was high!At wsb, we find unique patterns to bet on.Nice, don’t look at it as a 97% loss, you doubled your money from 1k-2k!!!> Lost it all in the chop as I was pretending to be a day trader and not just someone who got insanely lucky a few times.

I feel this on a deep personal level. $25k -> $$175k -> -$30k... Still reeling from that.How did you turn 1k into 70k what was the position??What chop? I feel you though my brother.  Think you can pull it off again?For the record TWLO has been killing it.  It's still up now with this market correction.  One of the few keeping me greenMeaning you did close to expiry plays? Or just kept cutting losses on bad option plays?Kinda the same for me. I go from broke to more broke. 😂Unfortunately only available in round trip tickets.I can't even begin to tell you how many times I've had something like a boring ass 50 dollar option trade explode to like 500 bucks... And all I can think is "let this mother fucker ride to the moon!"

I've lost it all every time. Yet I keep doing it.Seriously, we're all playing a video game until you click the sell button and transfer it to your bankRobinhood black cardIt’s all like playing a video game to meYeah I don’t know how I missed the dumb ass and shoulders pattern there, I think you’re rightNo one got it wrong, they are just thinking different things, semantically.

Anyone saying it will go to 140k is thinking that the next step is to get another 70k above the first 70k (doubling, it).

Anyone saying 490k is taking the ratio between what was invested (10k) to what was gained (70k), which is 7. And applying the same ratio to 70k you get 490k.

Although if 70k was after an investment of 10k, and since OP now only have 2k, the next peak should be 14k heheyes i suppose you're rightyou’ll never with an argument with an idiotAccurate, one in a decadeBoth usernames check outI don't think it was a jokeThis actually made me lol 😂😂I just faurted so hard I laghedI shidded and fardedUnderstandableCoping mechanism 🚨🚨But deep down he knows it's not gonna climb until he takes that plunge.Oh wow, someone on WSB promoting mask wearing...

That's why I think the OP probably has that feeling every time he opens his Robinhood since April.Meredith you've had sex with so many men you're starting to look like a man boom, roasted.Sweet were goin to VegasHigh on what?I'm swimming in it!But he started at $10k... so it's still an 80% loss lol😍But actually lost 8K.LOL that's the way to look at itMy first nut was a single TSLA call that I bought for my last 1k back in Jan/Feb.  TSLA went up 150 points within the next two trading days and I sold that one for 20k.  I had 20k for puts leading into the crash which I played at various times: UBER, M, SPY, CCL, etc.  Basically got lucky like 5 or 6 times and then I lost it all trying to reproduce my luck.What a great mindset!That’s how it feels likeHis 1k did also go to 70k though, so you could average it and get with 38.5×2k=77kI hear yaI just laughed so farted I hardThats a covid symptomI’m hardDamn this sub is full of terrible people

But I love itJust got Corona reading this shitHe said the strippers had masks on, he didnt say he was wearing one.Damn sorry.

Haven't seen deals like this since the 50s.High on tendies!You’re still doing better than Warren Buffett and Renaissance  🙂Why...you could buy anything! Even options!🤫🤫🤫No because he had 1k and now he's got 2k so he's made some money.

You're looking at this from the wrong angle.Not if he sets a different time frame on robinhood. Gainz boyYes and to have 10k you first have to have 1k so clearly he doubled his money since before he had 10k. It is simple math.Was your TSLA call out of the money and close to expiration? 

Ive been making ok returns on slightly OTM options 2 months out but I never see those 10x gains. I wanna step up my autism game lolFor the tards here, sure...I just harded so fart I laughedA masked stripper party? Count me inTwo for one?Just get in the medallion fund, it’s super easy.

Just need to be Robert Mercer’s kidUp 1k!!The TSLA call was 3 weeks out but keep in mind this was a different market.  When I sold it I was only a week in.I just got hardHolup! so u farted out of your mouth?I just harded you right in the fart and am laughing.Yeah but that’s just wasting perfectly good cocaine on a third wheel.

Congrats, now cash out and retire before you loose it all.took me awhile to realize this was not an option play...What is this? r/mainstreetsensibleinvestmentsCongrats. AMD stocks might get much higer following the failure of intel's  7nm cpu.Hi dad

Don't sell dude better times are ahead.I was waiting for someone to post AMD gains. Well done. I thought about buying some in-case INTC launched but I'm 0/4 this ER week so I sat this one out.

Congratulations 🎉Congrats, go fuck yourself!Thank you Shintel! Very cool!

Loading up on LEAPS after earnings.Can you tell me what image editing software you used there, that looks a reeel professional job.

Oh BTW Confuckulations!Chad.AMD's performance today literally vindicated the old saying of doing the exact OPPOSITE of r/wsb.

Someone was saying to buy puts when AMD is at $58 and calls when its at $52. If you ain't long for mommy AMD you don't deserve gainshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdfeXqHFmPI&t=1sWhat we are all trying to do.  Congrats manFuckin A....good shitI hate you, and I hope you know thatExit a majority of your position and start selling covered calls weeklyWhen did you buy these?

Also happy for you even if I'm on the INTC side. Took a ding this week, but still up massively on it as an investment. Wondering if I should pick up on some or wait for it to go lower.Same boat, are you gonna sell? Or wait until earnings?Me, being the clown I am, decided to sell some 1 day expiry calls at 65 when AMD looked to be closing below 60 yesterday.  This morning had to roll my 1 day sales a month out since AMD is shooting up like a rocket and I don't want to lose my shares.

Hopefully there's a crash in a month or so or I might have to roll them again.cant believe FOMOing AMD this morning already pushed 47%Money really do make moneyYou’ve gained another $75k, well done...fuck youshould be thanking intc. if they didn't shit the bed as much as they did with guidance, amd wouldn't have moved much.nice I remember looking at AMD at around 2 dollars a share, never pulled the trigger thoughWow, putting a quarter million into a single tech stock! Okay but now what you do is take all the profits and put it into a 1% interest savings account until you die. That’s the sort of thing that got you here in the first place right?Ngl, you could get me back in the game with a small donationFUCK YOU! congratsCongratulations and you can put that chip up ur assWould NIO be like AMD going to 69 in 4 years?You stole my tendiesI'll be your sugar baby! My body is ready!Congrats on the 5 year hold, and fuck you. 

I too have AMD average cost $12.  Just didn’t have 250k to throw down when I was 23....Good for you my dude!!! I envy yaa! Da Da!??Fucking old manshares? what's thatimagine if u had callsYeah thats cool but my buddy got in at 6.77...for 5 shares. And I ignored him on it completely so...

We were in high school/early college at the timeSir...you must be a professional. This is a casino.If I can end this week - a pretty solid week already - with a huge green hulk dick I’d be soooo happyr/ayyMDI see green numbers, that’s good I assume?Thank intcFellow td user 🤣Intel is still worth 214B vs AMDs 80B. And AMD is clearly dominating the market.Thank me for selling all my shares on Monday.I used to own 2500 at 2 bucks and sold at 13. Felt like a Chad. Then felt like a retard and FOMO’ed in at 52 for Lisa su (I’ll never let you go baby. I’m sorry for leaving)I spent 20k on weed this year. Let’s work something out? 🙌🏼🤝Literally held onto this forever at the $52 wall, and sold it at $57 right before the rocket took off. FML.AVG cost of 10.96, wow you've been holding for a whileI bought AMD 3 years ago because of this sub. Glad I held onto the OG meme stock.I closed some March 2021 calls for 110 percent profit (meager by wsb standards I kno)

When should I reenter for longer dated calls hmm..

Perhaps I should wait until ER for the volatility to die down (and the possibility of pullback)?Up yours!!!When did you buy this stock??Does this look like a game to you young man?I’m not crying, you’re crying!DadaChapeauOmg wtf amdWow. That is a lot of points!Can you buy me a Tesla?hey I am your lost son. Please call me at 1-282-Tendies. Please give me a call asap. love you dadDamn, and i thought I hit it big with my 3 calls on AMD lmaoDad?I don't get it. What option is this?You son of a bitch! Gotta love it !I'll take the extra 3000 shares from you so you can have a clean 20k. It'll make it a lot easier to look atIt’s not a gain until you sell, congratsHey son! I finally got the milk.Damn. I'm jelly.Why didn’t you tell usShares?shoulda waited for $69.69this retard hold his AMD shares thur good and bad time. 

Congrat!How the fuck do you average $10.96 per contract?!Unrealized gain. Realize most of it, pay your taxes. You will sleep betterSo glad I bought at $10/share all those years agoI wear a kilt and no underwear if you’re into that kind of thing

Socks go all the way up too =>So 4 years ago he invested $66k?  Or are these calls?grats dude. thats fuckin nutsWhen you lose it all Robinhood gives you free drinks at the barMind sharing your broader trading strategy? 


I looked through your some of your comment history and got snippets but would be curious what indicators you look out for, trade length and stuff (if you dont mind sharing)

But props on the gainzwhat app is thistight tight tightCongrats and fuck youyou are a cunt.. cunt.. cunt.. cuntinuous source of inspiration!Super jellyWtf also fuck you I am in the red consistently.Good gainzFucking loser you will have to pay so much in taxes. Fuck youI did something very similar. Only difference was I got in at $12 and am still holding my 30 shares.  So yeah, basically the same.App?Is there hope for intel? Seems like a decent buy honestly they aren't going to fail.. might be a rough year but intel will redeem I'm sure

Talk to you about amd passing 60 months ago i should've jumped in nice move man did you sell though?Good trade!Should’ve sold. Monday brings AMD back to earthMy guy invested 230kLol, fuck youi hope you sold near 70What the fuck? you can buy options with TD?Shit like this makes me very very erect.On Monday it opens down 10 and the loss porn be greatCaught this move early but sold at $61.  Like an idiotHey daddy 🍑oops must've stumbled on to /r/investingHey Doc,

I know you trade AMD mostly but do you think this is a good point to trade INTC? They still own majority market, do you see them recovering from their drop in several months?Impressive. Also fuck youDont buy amd they said, 12 dollars a share is over valued they said :*(fuck you you fellow canadian retard

oh and fuck you but like also congrats retard im proud of you ❤🍁❤Thank you Dr Lisa Su.AMD and ARRY. Selling too early those are the 2 that sting me the mostGod damn that must feel amazing
Congrats man, thats awesomeMan I had AMD calls and Facebook puts expiring today that I bought yesterday as a scalp. Made a quick 20%, had a hell I would have tripled my money on both of those.Nice. Take profit and keep holding AMD.JeeezzzzzzzzzIn at 10 dollars. I find it hard to believe, if your cock is so rocked for AMD that you didn't buy more along the way.We bought around the same price except I didn’t and still don’t have 200k laying around to put in it lolLmao @ people thinking this was all just today. This wasn't a bet, it was an investment years ago and it's just showing off the AMD AH price.

&#x200B;

Dude already had 1.37 Million yesterday you fools. Look at the avg cost fellow dunce cappers.

&#x200B;

But still.... It's a very impressing investment and damn i wish that was in my portfolio. My portfolio is full of a bunch of IOUs from Harry & Lloyd.Wtf is this portfolioFirst I was like oh you made 7k today. Big deal I made triple that today on my options....

&#x200B;

and then... I saw the overall gain. wow. congrats man for having faith in AMD and Su. Hopefully I can make those kinds of gains with AMD in the far future.You must not be one of the younger ones out here. Heavy down and then hold?? Whaaaaawow slow and steady wins the race huhi thought at first these were 23000 contracts. imagine those gainz🤣Only question I have is Did you start with $250k or did you build that up through trading ?I hate myself so much for getting out when it was stupid volatile.  Didn't have anything near this much but 1200 shares 9-13ish.  I know if I get back in, shits going to take so y'all are welcome.

FuckFucking legend.What else do you invest in?Thanks for the intel on this trade before doing it...Cost basis "252,050.64" it doesn't count if you're already rich enough to just take a 250K position and just zero fucks it for years..I lost my entire savings thanks to AMDIs this thinkorswim appI wanna be on your mailing listWatched all the green today while eating my salmon tacos.What’s the initial investment.  230k?What made you call AMD exactly? Also fuck you.I guarantee I can turn that into like $500 bucks in a few hoursIs that your IRA? What brokerage?Good god you lucky bastard. Congrats.Cash out now before I consider you a retard again.Cash out and yolo into something or ban!!!  Have we had a billionaire yet?  Seriously, awesome and FU as well!Enjoy the lambo and tendies.

Got it$1.2 million in a single stock? Diversification is indeed for idiotsIm your long lost son please send moneyIt would take a lot of money or balls to put in so much money. Apparently he has lot of money and 2 balls.CASH. TF. OUT!you probably bought it at around 2018
imagine if you bought it at 2016 😱Please cash out 95%. Don’t become another retard.It's all because of your privilige card 😡. Sarcasm.
Congrats and fuck you!How can we know this isn't a paper trade?But can you accept anal tho?It is the wayThat banana guy might have something to say about that.Daddy's richhhhhNice gains! Fuck youShould have bought those puts man...Honestly they deserve it for being too greedy and lazy. They really thought they can sit on their ass and take it easy and get rich from dividends and stock buybacks, and other shady manipulations. This goes out to pretty much every other large company.It's both. If AMD hadn't been killing it as hard as they have been lately, Intel's incompetence would being stinging them a lot less.More like IncelDamn, I just Googled the Intel news. Looks like Intel delayed some chipsets causing their competitors stocks to spike? I guess it pays off paying close attention to the news...But our overclocking!Intel has been lying about 10nm for years. What are the odds that they're lying about 7nm too?I trade AMD intra-day on another account too.Trailing stop loss FTW.Average cost of 10.96 a share. I think they'll be okay not cashing out anytime soon.They've been holding forever at an average cost of $10.96. I remember their username from the past, IIRC, he's a retired physician, they'll be fine.Nah, AMD hasn’t cost $10 in a long time. This has been years in the makingNo, AMD saw that I doubted them and sold my calls for 40% loss yesterday. They're mooning to spite me specifically /sHe is on wsb, he won't cash out till he regrets it.late 2016/early 2017 looking at the price history.   
quick DD, INTC is currently a P/E of just under 10 with a 2.5% dividend. AMD has a P/E over 165 and no dividend. INTC had more net income in the last quarter than AMD had in revenue over almost the past year. By recent stock market logic, I think that means YOLO AMDNo he has shares at a really low cost basisGood job Intel, you can't release 7nm bc you're all retarded.Don’t worry, he’s got years before Intel moves on from 14nm +++++++++++ chips and goes into 7nm to START competing with Intel

(Yes I realize Intel as a whole is still like 10x the size of AMD)loseIf you think you can retire on $1.2M then you truly are a chromosome collector.Is it just regular stonks? Im confusedI was looking for the exp and strike lolNot an option play = mehTook me a little too long to realize thatIt's all crazy gamblers here. Bought some Intel stock to hold for a decade because I too like to live slightly dangerously.AMD could reach NVIDIA price levels.Intel has big problems long term. It just took them to admit it for people to realize how far behind they are. 

AMD is making drastic gains in the enterprise sector with the EPYC line.Yeah, intel is falling further behind with this generation. AMD will be on 5mm before intel reaches 7mm.Well just estimating based on avg cost he's been holding since at least 2017Nah he threw 250k into AMD years back and held. 

This is peak /investingYes but he did it long ago...My lowest was actually in the $1.80s. I day traded it all the way up to $10 and put all the profits into acquiring more shares. Ended up with 23K shares and held them since.It was nearly 100% of my net worth at the time.Um, how exactly? This dude bought $250k worth of AMD shares years ago at 10 bucks. This is an /r/investing fucking bet at best.That’s the dumbest thing I’ve seen someone say on this sub 

Now that is epicNo it’s not it’s nowhere near austistic enoughSTFU, young Anakin.Lmao buying shares years ago is a wallstreet bet?

Wtf? I hardly see how this belongs here. 

Breaking: Guy with a lot of money bought shares a long time ago, and they went up.I did retire...He's worth $100m+. All you need is $10m for generational money and this dude has literal fuck you money as you can see in his trades. His kids don't even have to work a day in their life.That's a huge profit margin still it's almost as good, you need to have balls to invest in a stock worth 2 dollarsTbh that's the real wall street bet, more impressive than holding a sensible shareThanks. I hope you're still holding those shares?no, he can probably make more than most of us make every year just by selling covered calls with those shares..canadian td bank appFor real.No he doesn't his purchase average is like 10 dollars he bought this shit 3 years agoYes. Almost got assigned 2 weeks ago with some 56c. That would have been sad.Good for you. Gotta start somewhere. In 2008, I had less than $5K in my account and was trading 250 shares of AMD at time.Not dumb at all. This week, I sold at 59, 61.50, 62 and 67. Nothing wrong with taking some profits.True. But you have to start somewhere. I started in 2008 with less than 5000 dollars and a salary of 48K.  Retired in 2019.\*\*Theta gang intensifies.\*\*

Edit: You could sell to open relatively safe weeklies for like $16k.  Damn, that's $800k annually.  Best way to make money is to have money...Same boat too. This is a super long hold for me. Intel cucked hard last night. Like weenie-in-hand while muttering something about maybe being pan.

Not worth trying to time a small drop on the way to $100+.I prefer goujons.Thanks. I trade AMD intra-day on another account so I am booking gains daily there.avg cost is 10. AMD share haven't been 10 for a long time, bruh. this retard buy and hold AMD thur good and bad time.I thought everybody knew?I realize an average of $2K gains daily on my primary day trading account. This isn't the position I lose sleep over.Well that got weird.Thanks. This long term hold is part of a more than 10 year thesis for me. However, AMD also has characteristics of a perfect day trading stock. Thus, I hold shares here and trade shares/options in a different account. I rarely use technicals anymore. I trade the 1-min candle and spend most of the time watching time&sales plus track SMH and 2 complementary stocks (usually MU and NVDA). The majority of my trades are intra-day. Often intra-minute.Canadian TD appDon't be jelly. Nothing stopping you from getting there too. Except for wsb, I guess.TD Canada TrustA beaten Intel still owns 90% of the market. Even at its peak of technology leadership, AMD barely hit over 20% market share. So yes, Intel will redeem. Might take a year+. And when Intel can't win, they have historically resorted to illegal trade practices.61, at the time, was an all time high. Nothing idiotic about that.I think the drop today was overdone. In a normal world, INTC should lose market share quarter over quarter for the next year. The problem is, INTC has a history of nefarious business practices that have allowed them to flourish even when their tech has lagged behind AMD. The AMD ER next week will be instructive. I predict they will beat by 0.01 and guide to upper end of guidance for the remainder of the year. Stock should go up or at least  stabilize here. But the market is bat shit right now so who knows.Ha thanks! Nice name. I just introduced my son to Street Fighter.Started with under $5K in 2008ish. Day traded AMD and used all profits to increase shares. Was moving 500 shares at that time. It took about 18 months to get over $25K and could get around the PDT rules. Then scaled up. Keep in mind this was during a surgical residency so time was fairly scarce.Chin up brother. Many other non AMD opportunities out there. Keep looking. The opportunity cost of holding AMD for the past 3 months has been immense (until today).Pretty sure AMD was one of the OG meme stocks on wsb.Hey dude. When I first moved to the USA in 2008, I couldn't afford to pay rent so I lived in a fucking cockroach infected hostel. Maybe you need a handout to get rich. Not everyone does.These are long shares. I have swing shares as well.If he can't, I'll step upIs he allowed to finish?No praise, just fuck you and the stocks you rode in onGlad I sold my shares a week ago....I turned $1000 into $10K from my 60 weeklyPuts for Intel earnings? You woulda been IV crushed, unless you bought far out enough or something.Intel is the new fordThey'll be back though. This isn't the first time this story has played out, problem is intel has 10x the number of employees AMD does and can pay for the top engineering talent. All we're seeing is a sleeping (greedy, lazy) giant waking and its groggy and confused but it'll get there no doubt.High.They are not lying , they said that due to covid19 its delayed.

This was back in March.

IMHO they arent that much behind.

When Intel release i10  will that mean that AMD stocks will tonk!Can you not print like $50,000 in pretty OTM covered calls every couple weeks too??Is this account a long hold? Looks like you bought in at $10?what other tickers are you in right now for long term growth?Aaaand that’s how you most likely end up losing all your profitLiterally longer than half this sub was born.I miss AMD under $10. It really wasn't that long ago.

It languish in a channel forever till market finally realize they are giving INTC a run for their money.I sold AMD back in the day for 2.1 usd. Pretty stupidI was gonna say that’s something patience paying off good for him.I bought at $6-$7 back in 2016.  Bought and sold on and off...still average cost at $12.28.  I'm fucking happy.My brother told me AMD topped out at $18 and there was no more gains to be made.what? They were $1 in 2015 , 5 years is not a long time.Most of my regrets involve selling AMD on the way up to here.That’s the only way to play it! Hold through the peak, don’t be tempted to sell, it can go higher![deleted]Im a chromosome collector. With 1 mil I can sell enough covered calls to live super comfortably and not care about if stonks go up or downUmmm isnt that 120,000$ a year of average annual SP gains? That's a higher income than 95% of people in the world.Yes. AMD hasn’t  been $10 for a while now.What is a stock?Is GE considered a dangerous buy now?Yeah. AMD is a good investment in current times.they are slowly dominating gpu and cpu industries simultaneously.Facts. Just buy and hold and watch where it’s at in 2-3 yearsI don’t think so, NVIDIA has more going for it. Nvidia has much more in the form of Accelerrating AI / software than AMD.The EPYC gains have been anything but drastic. Are we at 10% yet?nanometerThat would be correct, I have a similar average and bought them back in 2017AMD was at 9.99 on April 20, 2018.


It’s a while either way.Let's be honest, if he had 250k to invest and hold on to up until now, I doubt this is his first million

Still, pretty insane gains, peak investing indeedHell yea brother, that’s gangster as fuckCool. Let's see your trades bro. Here are some of mine: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ec6jrx/822mil\_of\_amd\_in\_one\_year\_average\_trade\_of\_200k/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ec6jrx/822mil_of_amd_in_one_year_average_trade_of_200k/)tiny dick energy for sureAnd yet he's holding a million and you're holding your dick.Why don't you do the same?Put that into a mutual fund and send me my consultation fee haha best of luck man love to see iti bought 1 million shares of mlhc at 0.0001 for the meme. how big are my balls?👁👄👁Yes, and it has been the best investment decision of my life! Do you plan to trim your position, and do you have any price targets?I know, but he could have sold calls over the years. By his average he bought at least 3-4 years ago.

I remember when AMD was $2.Very true. Hell yeah dude! Good for you!I’m in wrong chat , I thought this was options gamblers Wall Street bets, thanks!Haha, that’s awesome! Well, then it’s a different story.Do you own any intel personally or strictly AMD? This seems more of a lotto run for AMD while they are drastically improving their technology doesn't mean they are going to leave intel in the dust. Very curious what other current plays you have.So you’re a sugar daddy AND a surgeon?What do you do? No, i don't need a handout, handjob would be nice tho. AMIRITE?!Take my buttFuck youI mean anyone who's been paying attention in the tech world knew that 7nm wasn't actually coming any time soonId say more like Boeing or GE

At one point they were the best, they actually invested into their engineers/workers and the company and reaped amazing rewards. But they decided its easier to be "financial institutions" and be wolves of wallstreet. 

Sad thing is, the top brass that pushed for stock buybacks and dividends still got their pump and dump to retire very very very comfortably.They can be back probably yea, we dont have enough info to guarantee anything. 

Thing is we have seen quite a few "too big to fail" giants fail.This.  Smart play is 2 year horizon boomer strategy.  Buy and hold. 

You'll still get those 2.xx% dividends while you're holding the bag.i11*

If they follow the pattern, the likely successor to the i9 would be the i11What about last year? when 10nm is shipping and they identified the problem, were fixing the problem, and yields were improving faster than expectations?Not 50k per 2 weeks. But yes, I sell calls.HertzLol strange math there but okayIn terms of WSB, a week would be considered long.I wish I had the knowledge and money when the PS4 launched. I was still in high school and I remember “I bet this will be good for the future of  AMD” and it was like $3 or $4 stock.Ugh god same here, I had a few hundred shares at $10 and couldn’t believe it when it finally blew past $18... sold at $30 :/lol traded it from 12-16 for what seemed like foreverI can’t believe I was trying to swing trade at $8, and never held onNot stupid, just inexperienced.AMD was my first stock that I ever purchased back in 2015, just to mess with Robinhood which was new at the time. I sold them for like a two dollar profit a few days later and cashed out because I didn't really know what I was doing and thought stocks were scary.


 [https://i.imgur.com/pI6NdYf.png](https://i.imgur.com/pI6NdYf.png)I mean if we comparing, I sold AMZN at $30 way back when.AMD was trash back then, but I still had an AMX Athlon during those days.Hindsight bias.back then their products were awful, though. AMD and intel were swapped with intel just shitting all over their CPUs without even trying and people were worried AMD would go bankrupt. Took AMD almost a decade to turn things around.Lmfao I held on until it got to 1.80 and sold all my shares. Fucking embarrassing.For gay investors maybeYeah but if you can't retire with a yacht then what's the point of living?It’s in the top 1% easily...
I read somewhere people on UK benefits were in the top 5% of world earners... when we say world you do realise half the world lives on less than a dollar a day? I think to be in the 1% of Americans it’s something like 135k?

Edit: For the U.K. it is 120k gbp so I’m not sure about america..Not this year RIP xDImagine buying a quarter mill in amd and watching it sit at $10 while the market steam rolls ahead...I guess he got the last laughStonks only go upNext gen consoles is all AMD.Eh they are still quite behind on the GPU front compared to NVIDIA but are blowing intel out of the water on the CPU front. Almost everyone I know who is building a computer is using an AMD CPU due to their ridiculous processing power and how cheap they are but I still have yet to meet anyone who has gone AMD over NVIDIAThey're dominating the budget and consumer grade CPU industry for sure. Their high end professional grade CPUs are still better IMO but more comparable. Basically no reason to buy Intel over them unless you need 5% more performance and don't care what it costs.
It's not so black and white with GPUs though. Nvidia still dominates high end gaming and only when you get into budget/midrange does it become a fair fight. And even then, with those driver issues in the past, it's hard to recommend them to someone who doesn't have the capacity/patience to troubleshoot drivers. And although AMD is bringing new GPUs to market that will supposedly outperform current NVIDIA cards, Nvidia is doing the same, so I can only speak for what's on the market today. I'm watching this nvidia and ARM deal like a hawk tho.

TLDR: AMD dominates a large chunk of CPU market and is competitive in GPU market. It's a great stonk.> slowly dominating gpu

Jury's still out on this one. NVIDIA has an incredible lead with GPGPU on CUDA, and their actual GPUs at the high end are still ahead of the game. 

Still, AMD future potential is gigantic — don't discount how meaningful their APU work is.gpu not so much, sadly. Fuck Nvidia.Per Q1 we are not, however I do believe it was an impressive jump. Considering that they were still in the initial release of Rome and were still negotiating new cloud contracts. All things considered when you look at the server lineup, its a no brainer. Epyc runs on more cores and less power than Xeon. I expect this quarter to be above 10% given that the new hardware has been on the market long enough to be installed. 

Also they are planning to release the Epyc [Milan](https://www.google.com/amp/s/wccftech.com/amd-explosive-market-share-growth-server-notebook-segments-2019-ryzen-epyc-cpus/amp/) series later this year. 

Its only my opinion but based on what we've been installing in the field and what admins have been saying. A majority if not all new data centers are using Epyc. Firms that can afford the upgrades are doing the same. 

It's this set of info that I will be scanning come the 28th.Well fuck, that was retarded of me.Hi dad, it’s me. That prostitute  in Las Vegas wasn’t on birth control.Chad energyLong stock with dollar cost averaging... Nice safe plays good job.

How does this belong in wallstreetbets?Even the dumb redneck gets it.He’s brokeI'm scared of index funds. I would never risk my money like that.Ironically, the same size as the share price.Congrats! I have another batch of shares for swing trading. Unfortunately I trimmed too early and sold some shares at 59, 61.50, 62 and 67. Can't complain though. It's been a great run.I remember that day like it was yesterday. Then the guys in /r/investing convinced me to stay away since back then, AMD was highly leveraged and was well on it's way to bankruptcy. Then Ryzen came out.u are not wrong. u are in the right chat. we should ban OP. he should post his shares gainz @ /r/investingHardly a lotto run for AMD. The problem is, the stock doesn't move for months, and then does this. If it just followed the general tech market the past 3 months (see NVDA) it would have been in the mid 60s anyways. Never owned INTC but seriously considered it today. Played NIO most recently from 7 up to 12 (against my better judgement).No way dude, I called dibs!And my ax (face hole)Y’all mofos gay af!!!!Anything i say can't top this thread, fuck youI Never understood dividends, say you invest 10k into intel. That’s 200 bucks a year right? How is this great?Yeah... I sold covered calls on amd as well. Fucking sold 7/31 62c when amd was at mid 50's last week. Can't wait to get exercised.People gained and lost massive amounts in minutes of trades , not sure what’s your point with average cost if the stock itself self tanks , no average cost can save you no matter how small it is . One million secured is better than nothingHahaha same for me too! I thought i was the shit because of that.Why not both?Not inexperienced, just autist!Lol I'm basically the same. But after coming back a few years later and now I just buy expensive options and sell them for cheapMan you were here when we had the JNUG and JDST  days.FBought them in 2011. Wish I had bought a ton more, but was a broke at the time.Haha i bought an Apple computer in 1999. Even in the shop they said it was possible that Apple would not make it much longer. How it has all changed.K6-2 was my first build when I was 11.50% of the kids in this sub thought you were talking about shoewear.America is around $400k a year to be in the 1%Yes this year lol, SP is up 51% since July 24, 2015.Really? Xbox one and PS5 ?Consoles have been using AMD hardware for awhile. That's nothing new.Run an IT company and we quit spec'ing Intel processors in servers because they are ridiculously expensive and Intel came out with a stupid af processor line. Do you want a bronze, silver, or gold xeon processor? Fucking stupid. I'll sell those 24c AMD's all day.Agree. Will have to see what Big Navi brings. Now, on the CPU front, AMD has held the technology lead many times in the past, but seldom broke through the 20% market share threshold. But, this time will be different...Mostly agree with you. I just believe that AMD  mindshare at the enterprise level is not moving as fast as the DIY market. This is not the first time that AMD had the better/faster chip/cheaper. Opteron at its apex, with clear technological advantage, peaked at only 20% market share.I did not buy as many as OP, only have about 50 sharesWhy do you keep a ship's wheel in your pants?Renaissance Tech Hedge Fund is killing it I’m pretty sure they have the right algorithm to make you money either way enjoy being a millionaire manWhen it was trading sideways between 50 and 58 in the last three months, I was kicking myself for not doing any swing trading. Now I am patting myself on the shoulder for not giving in when the urge was strong. Life can be a funny business. I did sell quarter of my Tesla position (entry at $250) at $1.5k though, and I plan to buy back at $750.Never listen to r/investing. They are actually bottom feeder idiotsModssssssI call flufferFuck you too buddy. It's a retirement plan when you have 2 million in stock. Pull in an easy and (almost) guaranteed 50k a yearDividend invest is for when you're old and have lots of capital, generally.that’s so unlucky man wowand then do what with the money? in the end of the day you're just transferring value from one asset to another that you think is less risky, what makes you think AMD will lose value in the time range that OP has in mind?This is the wayYeah they use amd chipsThat's really interesting. I just bought my first AMD Thinkpad. The damn thing has 8 cores. In a laptop!Well said. The DIY market and mid enterprise level (CAD and mid tier workstations) in my opinion are going to take some time. Same argument here for Threadripper as Epyc in server grade. However from a macro level I see the growth being more rapid given that I can't think of another time Intel has been in this weak of a position. All said and told I'm really excited for AMD from a competition standpoint to move the needle like they have been. 

This is good autism. Much appreciated.I’ll take anything I can get sirRen tech Medallion fund is only available to employees. Mere mortals will have to settle for WSB memes to get guidance.I hated that sideways action as well. In fact, I dump a ton of swing shares as soon as it hit $59. Now I'm getting sad.

On the flip side, I made good money selling calls when we were stuck in the 50-58 range. I almost got assigned at 56 a couple weeks ago. That would have sucked.

Good job on TSLA. I never got on board with that one. I have traded NIO more recently.I got banned from WSB for yelling at people to buy AMD and TSLA.

Soooo.... glass houses/throw stonesGo fuck yourselfWhat made you think that AMD will continue to gain more , in the end you made 5 times your investment . Look at all the loss porn here , al of them had insane gains at one point but they refused to cash outHmm I might have to buy shares for my Roth IRA thenDamn I’m gonna end up having to pay you for consultation. But uh maybe Fuck it and go Berkshire A with a stop loss while you’re on vacation haha 😂I run the wheel with MSFT and RTX selling calls and puts, what about getting assigned is the downside for you at 56? Are you doing covered calls on all of your shares at once on one strike price?How do you “almost” get assigned?Did you buy AMD and TSLA then?well, for one, the loss porn here is mostly due to trading insane amounts of weekly options close to expiration and not shares like OP's.

you hold shares when you believe there's still value to be added to the company, and you sell them when it doesn't make sense to keep it, you don't just hold until you hit a magic number... cashing out just means holding USD; I'd rather hold AMD than USD.Current gen is AMD alreadyMajor tax implications. Shares are easy to replace. >1yr old shares are hard to replace. Multiple strikes usually at 1 week, 2 weeks and 1 monthI sold the 56 call. The stock hovered above 56 which means my broker would take my shares and pay me 56, even if the stock was at 57. However, by expiration day, the price tanked below 56, thus saving my shares.Yes.I’m fucking retarded , i thought he bought options not shares sorry didn’t pay attentionAMD seems like to go-to for PC gaming hardware as wellYeah gotta make it big so I can build a new computer with a 3950xWhat else do they sell?Well they got the 3000 line of ryzen which is really good. Ryzen 3600 (not the x or xt) is the best bang for your buck cpu at the moment. Their GPUs are good but have driver issues. Their high end CPUs like the threadripper or server CPUs EPYC are taking over the enterprise market slowly. They just announced new OEM CPUs for prebuilts that you would buy at best buy. Their laptops are doing great beating out desktop CPUs. At all levels they are challenging Intel.Seems like AMD has the edge on the future. But intel has been around for a while and you can’t doubt them. If AMD kills earnings it’ll probably drop a bit, that’s my guessSomeone please make a pixel game of that. Our heroine going against the evil corp. In her final victory, she butt fuck Bob Swan. And make Jensen Huang, the little gimp crying in his corner. Please do it and put it on Steam.Intel took a shit. Nvidia is the most valuable chip manufacturer in the world. AMD walked past Intel after years as the underdog. What a fuckin time to be alive!Not my proudest fap, but gains are gainsI took my gains this morning. And sold calls to all you dumb fomo bitchesFact: Googling the term "Su Bae" returns the Wikipedia article for Lisa Su.Jesus. I thought I teleported back to 1991 playing shitty PC games.Wonder what happened to the guy that said a couple weeks ago AMD was going to go bankrupt because they over leveraged themselves in R&D.If you’re sad you missed $AMD, $TSM still has room to run.Jump on the bandwagon mofos. AMD is one of the few companies that didn’t took a tumble right before Earnings. Let’s show MSFT how it’s done 📈AMD carrying my actual investment portfolio today. BIGLYI’m a pop star not a doctorrr“Nano machines son”And Intel had a complete opposite drop of 16%.

(I m a  AMD Leaps call holder)Only AMD graphics cards can play itDon't get too excited.  AMD and Intel are probably both going to underwhelm in the realm of CPUs for a while.  Keller dug AMD out of their grave with the Zen design and then left for . . . Intel (though he did recently resign, maybe seeing how the recent news was about to play out).TSMC is the largest. Prints chips and tendies.I didn't have any gains, but i still cameShould’ve hold, AMD hits new all time high and will continue to do soSame, but I'm gonna take my profits and roll them into leaps on Monday.Naked calls or covered?damn you got balls, if AMD pulls off a TSLA type of run up.....which is not out of realm of possibility given the huge momentum, another short squeeze can happen no doubtIf you google "Su Bae," the first result is a reddit post who's top comment is by me. 

Mods can I get a flairIt's a classic pixelated indie brawler now :DDid you know they still sell Mountain Dew and Doritos?i've seen more than one of those on herewho tf got in on AMD and pass TSM up? clowns.Intel released trash guidance. I sold my TSM calls (which was hard, because I like to read the ticker as " 'tism ") for a decent profit today and bought long dated, cheap AF intel calls for next year. They'll be back eventually, today's sell off was over done. But for now, AMD has all the BDEMade it rain tendiesActually SMH is a semiconductor ETF hahaholding 3000 shares like me bruh?Bought back in for some 10/16 90 calls after selling 8/31 70 calls this morning for a nice profit.As of right now yes. The turn around for AMD has been incredible in 3-4 years. Will NVDA hold the throne in the next decade? Not a clue. AMD will easily become a big threat to them soon. They still have a lot to go with beating IntelDr Su turn around an essentially bankrupt company to fucking the world's top semi company in the ass no lube in a few years.Rx 5700 is currently the best value gpu on the market and before that it was the 570 but yes I would like to see them perform at the high end toointel shills BTFOI see what you did there and I like it.But the drivers will crash before you ever finish the game.I just wish I knew to buy Nvidia when I was building shitty pc’s with the first GeForce cards to run Half Life.........Id have big tendies.Keller is not the type of the person that stays in a company long term. And there is a reason why Keller left Intel.>AMD and Intel are probably both going to underwhelm in the realm of CPUs for a while

So you're telling me there's room to grow and opportunity for exceeding expectations?

All in.How big are the tendies?I lost money, so I always come.Well sir, bring it onCredit spreadsSend nudesSu bae is probably OP thoughbasics

also people who think huawei matters somehowSame on those intel calls. It’s easy to forget they still fucking dwarf AMD in so many capacities, however much I honestly hate them and want AMD to generally succeed (along with laughing at shitty management). 

Also I used to have like 50k in AMD back in end of 2017 when we were pushing $10 but sold for a loss as intels IPC shit down their throat so severely. My throat ended up the same way seeing ~$70 today.True but not enough last 2 months. Nvidia printed more.

But You're right, CUDA is absolute trash. AMD learned that more open sourced solutions are the way to go so I give them huge credit for realizing the power of millions of autistic users constantly improving the OpenCL platform rather than bagholding a bunch of frozen tendies like NVIDIA.Hey man it worksYou’re not gonna get me to say I like tiny tendies......not even if there’s a fire.Delete app, kiss your boyfriend goodbye, move to Mexico, change name to JuanSee you in 90...Uninstall and reinstall.

1) will deposit $700k into their robinhood points app or 2. have $700kYou can't gift most assets in something like the 180 day period before a bankruptcy filing.

You can't gift real estate in like 18 months before bankruptcy filing.

My time frames may not be 100% accurate, but there are rules to that effect and if the trustee who will comb through your financials finds out you did try to hide asset they can void the bankruptcy and you can't refile for I think 6 months.

End of day or Monday they will sell the shares he got assigned and credit him the rest to his account depending how the stock is doing he could be positive $1 or owe -$1k ,    -$5k, -$10k.A day trade call is not an indication of a debit or an actual amount owed. It's the amount he exceeded his day trade buying power, thereby triggering a regulatory violation.

As much as this sub jokes around, I genuinely do not understand how Robinhood survives as a company.Robinhood pts. Write their customer service and ask how much that is in tokens you think you have enough but wanna make sureWhat happens if you don't? Do they have to cover it?And here you are, back at the casino.

well _that_ at least isn't gonna happenCorrect me if I'm wrong but I thought u can only be assigned if your the seller (aka buyers have to option to exercise) so he must have had spreads in somethingSo seriously just showing total size of your spreads since you’re locked out and can’t do anything ? And needlessly scaring people like they did to the kid who took his lifeWhat happened??nah, weeds legal all over the placeI don't believe they'll let you change to cash at this point similar to how they won't change your account to cash if you have pending trades or fundsi see what youre sayingyep yepI mean the applicationThat's what I mean that robinhood can let you go with expired option with just 90 days ban. I am surprised why everyone is not selling naked options.Donde esta la bibliotecha?Donde esta el dinero?Donde esta le leche?This comment needs more likesOnly 1% will upvote this reply.i commented my explanation of what happened in this post. I agree, robinhood is retarded.6 whole months? Yeah right. Not all of us have that kind of crazy long a time horizon, Mr. Buffet.Can you lose more than you put in? I’ve never messed with options or anything like that so I’m not sure how it works.We talking about RH or universities?He's not in debt. Well, unrelated he still probably is, but this is a day trade call.Except he’s not half a Mil in debt. Its just how robin hood does credit spreads. If he waits hell be fine. Now shut the fuck up.Robinhood can borrow money at very low rates. Probably 1-2% since fed rates are at 0%. Fed can just buy Robinhood funds. Or corps that sold bonds to fed use their cash to invest in Robinhood. Money is very cheapI am sure there is something in the TOS that if you blow up your account its their problem lol."Hello, customer service rep Angie. I wanted to ask, how much is that in Stanley Nickels?"Wait till they see how much I can rack up now that I know the rules!

It's my 7 year plan...For the 69Please reach out before you actually an hero though, ultimately this is just numbers on a screen.Nope. Called the preference period.

SHAKING THE PHOTO WAS A PLACEBO?!?Got rid of the dirt in the cartridge so it can be readIf it makes the gameshark work, not placeboAs far as i know that actually causes more longterm problems with the cartridge. You can get spit/ saliva on the pins in the cart causing damage.Lol yea it was definitely a placebo. It was almost always the hardware from the console inside that caused those issues for most. It would get damaged little by little over time. Blowing if anything would have done more harm then good because you would technically be creating condensation and moisture on the metal contacts, but probably would take you like a million blows before you’d see any noticeable difference.I ended up having to stick one cartridge on top of the other to get it to work.Blowing on the cartridge was bad, shaking the polaroid was bad.It did nothing. There was never enough dust on there unless it was decades old. The spit actually was corrosive and damaged the metal.Most of the problems were fixed just by reseating the cartridge. Blowing into it can *maybe* damage the delicate gold fingers.So do vape pens, so they'll get it one way or the other.NES you fuckin' n00b.What about pencil sharpeners and pen erasers?That would make your mom really sad.Toothpaste was the DIY version.

I couldn’t imagine being an 18-19 y/o kid with no finance background/knowledge seeing this. It’s fucked up how they even can make a mistake like this. 

Robinhood is a joke platform. Shit is designed to look like a casino, but man is it sexy.So, my day trades were capped off because I made 4th trade on the the week following July 4th. I forgot that its five TRADING days, rather than business days. This made me pdt marked, so I lost my 3 trades a week.

Fast forward to yesterday, I was jacked to the tits in spy puts, I bought them at open Thursday, wanted to lock in profits. Had a bunch of spreads opened to try to hedge profits, but decided I wanted to just cash out, so I day traded, locked my account.

Once you lock you account, you have the remainder of the day to go nuts with day trades, went through a bunch of Tesla Spreads, Spy contracts and racked up 30+ trades in a day to cap off my robinhood journey.

I’d assume the spreads make it look like I traded an insane amount, so realistically I probably need to deposit $3000ish-$5000. No wonder that kid killed himself, robinhood is fucking terrible. 

I have accts with tasty, and tos so just gonna transfer my funds into tos for the 90 day period.

UPDATE: Sarah from robinhood just email’d me, I have an actual day trade call amount of $3,125.

So yeah. Fuck robinhoodNicePapa John’sWhy seems every Spanish book on earth to start with the question where to find the fucking library? Seriously: Why?Me lammo T-bone LA arana discotechaLa Playa estupido!¿Como we can all supermercado?Donde esta tu madres cullo?Donde esta mi padre con mi dinero?I had this happen to me, well not quite the same.

I had a spread on Amazon go in the money and I got assigned. Hit me for like 100k or some stupid shit when the max loss on the spread was supposed to be $500. The problem was that the assignment happens instantly, but when they go to execute the other leg of the spread to keep you covered, it takes 2-3 business days to process. So i actually only lost $500, didnt owe a margin call, and got locked out due to my account showing I owed 100k.

When I saw the news article about that kid offing himself due to losing everything when, "it was supposed to be a defined risk trade," i knew exactly what had happened. And even worse, if robinhoods customer service actually existed, the poor kid could have gotten real answersI'm going out on a limb and assuming INTC is involved... wonder why the automod deleted your explanation post.It's already been removed by automodIt was deleted.Lol wow you weren’t kidding. That’s as hilarious as it is fucked up. Good on you keeping your head through it>robinhood is retarded

Who else lol’dLmao

No of course not, just deposit some money and click the button that says "margin." come back in a week to show off all your fresh tendies.A margin account? I thought it was called margarine account....You shouldn't be able to unless you're writing naked options. Margin alone, assuming the firm's controls are working properly, should never result in you losing more than your whole account.You're only allowed to MAKE more than you put in.

Do try to keep up.Universities are subsidized by papa government. Student loans are through papa government. When u get to take ur customers money before they even get it u don't have to give a fuck about fiscal responsibility. $23 trillion in debt?

# These Companies Gave Their C.E.O.s Millions, Just Before Bankruptcy

Corporate boards are handing out millions to top executives before their companies seek bankruptcy protection, and courts can’t do much about it.

 J.C. Penney and other companies that are struggling to pay creditors and suppliers are still finding ways to pay millions in bonuses to their bosses. Credit...Chang W. Lee/The New York Times 

 J.C. Penney, which [is closing](https://ir.jcpenney.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/618/jcpenney-provides-update-on-store-optimization-strategy) 154 stores, paid its chief executive, Jill Soltau, $4.5 million. The chief executive of Whiting Petroleum, which sought bankruptcy protection in April, received $6.4 million, and Chesapeake Energy is paying bonuses ahead of an [expected bankruptcy filing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/business/energy-environment/chesapeake-energy-bankruptcy-protection.html). Executives at Hertz also got payments before the rental-car giant [sought bankruptcy protection](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/business/hertz-bankruptcy-coronavirus-car-rental.html).That’s what she saidRemember those cleaning kits with the little squeegee, cleaning solution, and cleaning cartridge?😂. Go Sox baby. Put some money on tonight !!Was submerging it in that fluid in a darkroom also placebo???!!!Gazeebo. And yes.Fucking gameshark😂😂

Don’t know why but virtual boy just popped in my head. They really need to sue oculus lolYup agreedMe too! I thought I was the only one.Agreed!That’s what I think the take out put back in was what did it. Like aligning printer cartridgesremember that pen that had the eraser and the tribal pattern on it? I always thought it was overrated. I bought some silver and gold chrome Bic pens on Ebay and I'd sell them for a dollar/ two dollars when people needed pens, they were panic buying and always thought it was a cool pen - creating repeat customers. I made like 900 dollars with that business, good times.lol thats about the response i expect from inbred cyclopsand this is why RH is retardedHonestly, if someone's betting this much they should already understand this sort of thing I think.
Otherwise it's just gambling. And we know what happens to gamblers who can't pay their debt.Yah they need to mute that shit. They know most of their age range and obviously they would never let a trade to open with this kind of risk / leverage yet they are cool with flashing this and giving the little idiots heart attacksSo they exercised all the options got it.So they basically stole your contracts and probably exercised them for you. Get SEC involved, this seems like securities fraud on RH's part.sorry, i'm mostly here for the memes not even gonna lie.

this means you're in 3,125 in red right?Lol @ fuck rh because user moran.Tell Sarah I said hi.If you go below $25,000 at TD you're just restricted to closing transactions for 90 days unless you get it up again.Blames Robinhood for his own mistakes lolWait you can make a 5th day trade when your are marked PDT, and then make unlimited more that same day? But the entire account gets banned for 90 days. So not just day trading but anything. Is this correct? May need this info for future autismTeach me how to take advantage of Robinhood like Epstein.Grandes misterios del universoThey were all written when there was no internet so in order to learn any other Spanish you had to go to the library duhLas bibliotecas son muy importantesDuh. You need that phrase to build other phrases critical for eleven year olds. For example:

donde esta la oficina de inmigracion

donde esta tu mami

donde es la fiesta

Donde estan tus pantalonesSo you can reunite with this book one day when you need it most.Dude I was wondering exactly how this works because I’m aware of this risk and how doing credit spreads and shit can lead to assignment which can lead to pin risk. Just to avoid any sleepless nights I always close a couple days before expiration.

Is the max loss truly the max loss? Or does robinhood pin you with the cost of the underlying movement 

Do you know anything else about how robinhood handles it I’m too scared to let them expire lmao> When I saw the news article about that kid offing himself due to losing everything when, "it was supposed to be a defined risk trade," i knew exactly what had happened. And even worse, if robinhoods customer service actually existed, the poor kid could have gotten real answers

He should have just posted on here so we could have murdered him with words and saved him the trouble.

But for reals, that's some sad shit.  It's just money.Do you have a link to that story?You can see u/TheHappyItalianMan 's update if you click on his profileSo this is impossible to happen still if you are writing credit spreads or like iron condors?This is definitely false. Hell, you can lose more than your account without even ever touching options. Buy stock on margin, stock immediately goes to zero. You're out more than what you deposited. And that's just one (extreme) example.Well here's hoping you made some money while taking RH on that ride 😘*goes to copy machine*Love yourself while you’re hereI had one of these it actually worked. No homo.Hell yeah, can’t waitYes. All photographers are bullshit liars.You know what, upon reading these again it occurs to me you must really hate yourself. Small pp perhaps? Or maybe just standard in closet ghey?They just adapt to their clientsI opened my td ameritrade to 18k loss with one position open with a max loss of 500 or something.

I just ignore the numbers in my account unless they look  like they are going in my favor. Seems to be working well. Losses are just glitches.“Hello, SEC. this is autist speaking”Care to explain?It means they have a balance of $21,875.BonjournoLa biblioteca es donde guardamos la cocaina.¿Donde es el novio de tu esposa?But that would work with anything. Yet every course seems to teach the bibliotheca question first.Max loss is max loss when all is said and done. It might not look like it for a few days though. 

Right, so say you sold a call at 100 and bought one at 105, and underlying goes to 120. You get assigned and you just were forced to sell 100 shares at 100. Robinhood algos realize this fucks your account. So what should happen is you execute the option you own and buy 100 shares at $105 to sell at $100. The problem, like I said, is the assignment happens instantly and the execution takes a few days. So your account shows that you shorted 100 shares of the underlying and your account goes fucking haywire with the underlying stocks value, until the execution process and that -100 shares goes back to zero because you bought 100 at $105.

You only lost $500, but you probably also lost years of your life with the bullshit display.

Bonus points: idk if they fixed this or not, but when it happened to me, the options chain in robinhood actually showed I owned different positions than what my account showed and it rejected all my proposed trades.

Best to close a few days early and avoid assignmentIt happened to me last week. I was down -$3.5 million last Fri. Came out with minimal losses as it is defined. On Monday it cleared out. I did bull credit spreads.

To calculate max loss:difference between the strikes - credit received
And max profit: credit receivedThe only situation where you can hit more than max loss I think is if you get assigned early on your short leg and there is massive price movement before the other leg gets closed out.Any spread strategy always has a max loss, so yes. The firm will hold that amount up front as your "cost" to place the trade.You'd have been sold out already. It would take a major failure of controls for that to happen in real life.too late😂 uninstall. Install. Refresh"Sir, you just described 99% of traders"I thought it was RH locked his account after so many trades, and assumed he was trading on margin. Went and reread his post and turns out OP was just autistic.thank youFeliz navi dad.🤣Max lose is not *always* max loss. If one leg is assigned or exercised and the opposing leg is OTM you can end up holding shares, and depending on what the security opens at the following trading day if you sell or get sold out at market max loss can be exceeded.> So what should happen is you execute the option you own and buy 100 shares at $105 to sell at $100

what if, in this example, you did not have the $10,500 in your account to fulfill the 105call of 100 stock shares?Dude get off Robinhood!  Why are peoplr so loyal to this shit company and platform?!?!You can use margin money for that collateral. So if you're writing credit spreads, you can lose more than your account."always" is wrong. 

Say you open a put credit spread of FAKE. You sell a $50 put then buy a $40 put. You might assume your max risk is $1000. 

Lets say the stock price on expiration is $45 so the $50 short gets exercised but the long doesn't. Then over the weekend Jesus Raptures everyone in the company and their stock opens on Monday at $5. You're going to lose $4500.max homo engagedI need to deposit $3000-something dollars if I want to continue to use robinhood for the next 90 days, I dont, So I wont deposit the money.You can’t read and OP is somehow the autist?Yeah i guess if you have the funds to handle the assignment and your broker doesn't auto execute your other leg, yeah it can be worseYoure selling them right away for the option that got assigned. Robinhood "loans" you the 10k cause they know they're getting it right backBro I left lol I dont deal with this shit anymore. Also just left etrade because they fucked me out of 9k. Had a qqq options no longer showing up in my account on day of expiration. Went ITM and I got assigned. Sold at open Monday for a 9k loss. They refused to do anything about it even tho I messaged them in their system and called them to tell them I couldn't see the position and I wanted to close it BEFORE all this happenedThat still wouldn't result in you losing more money than your account assuming proper controls. That collateral is in the same account. The firm would blow you out of whatever positions they needed to to cover themselves on the way down (including the spread itself) if your account really was getting nuked on any given day.Yea I don’t use margin but I get how robinhood is dumb when it comes to letting autists like me write options still for basically $5/mo. That’s why I never did until I learned how spreads work very recently to have more control over the risk going into trades and max profit/loss potential. Credit spreads and/or condors seem like good strategies for highly volatile underlyings.Walk me through that math?

You would just exercise the long dude. Or, more accurately, your firm would have already forced you to on Friday.

Or, even _more_ accurately, they would have closed the spread as a two leg transaction and avoided assignment at expiration altogether.Look at this guy with plans and shit. You should ask Sarah out.Can’t they still come after that money? I’m confused.I’ll have you know that autists can read just fine.

But that sentence was a little long, next time keep it to a ticker, a date (no year necessary, if it’s not in the next 2 months nobody finishes reading) a strike and “call” or “put”, that’s about as much as I can hold in memory at once.> The firm would blow you out of whatever positions they needed to to cover themselves on the way down

Not really how options work a lot of the time. You could very well go to bed with your spread being positive and the markets could open at your max loss. In fact, if the b/a spreads are against you, you might only be able to close the position for _more_ than your max loss. Your max loss is only the max if you exerciseThat’s good to know. I don’t ever trade with margin but I have little trust in robinhood to warn me about possibly going negative still if they screw up in handling the positions. I’d like to think I’m not autistic but this is 2020 now and I have gotten my flu shot every year normally. So I’m definitely autistic by now and prolly late to the party trying to trade these strategies anyways with market volatility falling mostly since March/April.You can't exercise the long as it has expired. It's believe it's called pin riskNo, they took his positions. Those are their losses now. If he wants to use the platform he needs to square it up, but he's not in a collectible debt.

Note: I'm not a CPA or a lawyer or any of that shit, nor have I been in this position. But that's my understanding of itIf markets were crossed (extremely rare) and it actually cost you more than your max loss to close the spread, they could just not close it and make you take your max loss. It doesn't matter if your spread goes to shit overnight, max loss is literally max loss. You wouldn't _have_ to close it. They're already holding your max loss to the side. They're covered either way, those strikes don't move. If you hold the spread to expiration, that's the most you can possibly lose. If it cost more than you had available to close it at any given time, you just wouldn't have the money to close it at that time, simple as that.

You think firms would risk going to collections left and right just by letting people do spreads? Naw man. They can't be chasing clients for money they don't have. I do exactly this risk control for a living, trust me. If a retail client ever owes their firm money in a margin account, the firm has already fucked up in their controls in a big way.So assignments could screw that up still if it happened like an early assignment? Beyond wide bid/ask spreads like you are mentioning? That’s one of my concerns with trading credit spreads. It seems highly unlikely if you don’t have short term expiry’s. But don’t early assignments pose some sort of risks beyond what you are floating for the position?Ok so what you're talking about is a failure of controls on the firm's part. Not exactly factored into risk on a spread any more than a meteor impact is, but yes I did mention that above.> they could just not close it and make you take your max loss

Right. But your max loss can be more than the cash you deposited. Which is the whole point of what I was saying> But don’t early assignments pose some sort of risks beyond what you are floating for the position?

Only up to your max lossEven if you got assigned early, you're holding the long contracts yourself and you decide when those get exercised (although the firm might decide for you if you're looking at a big debit).

So if someone assigned your short options early and stuck you with the position unexpectedly, you would then turn around and exercise your long options to get back out of it. Since those two trades go off at the  predetermined strike prices, the most you would lose is the difference.

Although that might make your balance look scary for a day, you and your firm have still only risked that amount you put up at the beginning. Hope that helps!Yea I think I understand what you both are saying. This is why I don’t trade with margin, even when robinhood would let me do so more easily than an 18 year old getting a Best Buy charge card account for $10k while in school and working part time for like 25k/yr lol granted I did get a sick ass 1080p with a small piece of that lol but I paid it off before the 0% interest financing terms ran out.Err who cares about cash deposits tho? This was always about whether you could end up owing the firm money... Your securities are as good as cash, it's all the same in a margin account.Is that your ti-15 explorer, all it's missing is a fatass boogerwhat’s the numbers and letters above it mean?Is this where I’m supposed to buy in?I remember playing drug wars on my ti-86.

https://i.imgur.com/Tj5XSSB.jpgFor a moment I was sure I wasn’t on wsb, everyone seems to be bashing Elon and praising stimulus, hmmIf you read his follow up tweets under that one he does clarify and say a stimulus should be direct payments to consumers. It’s all the other stimulus BS he’s against, or so he makes it seem that wayLast time he tweeted in a similar tone (“tesla stock is too high imo”) we mooned. $2000 confirmed.Also, it’s really disingenuous to post only the top tweet without posting the second, selective quotations are poor... yes he said that but w/out context and the entirety of the speech you are basically aiming for character assassination.Elon Musk is just another Thomas Edison. He is not a real Nikola Tesla.Elon Musk is the vampire capitalist that wants everyone to go back to work so that they can buy his Model 3s or drop dead from the corona.[deleted]Elon is such a Grade A hypocrite. Scored a tax break from Texas govt for Austin factory and only showed a Q2 profit due to government credits. But doesn’t want a stimulus for people who are struggling to meet ends.This thread sums up reddit perfectly. Read the 2 sentence headline and react/share that stupidity 10 fold. Not actually getting the full context or look deeper.He’s not wrong, further stimulus is just going to fuck over our kids in the futureHe’s a fucking tool. Don’t know why everyone likes this cuntThis is fake news. Please share his next tweet as well.Good billionare ideas here, boys.Fuck his opinionBased Musk is best MuskElon is rightIt should be vouchers redeemable only at your local Tesla dealership, right Elon?Lmao elon sucksIt's okay for elon to hundreds of millions in tax credit but not okay for regular folks to get a one time stimulus check?Takes some balls to say that shit.Is he still advising Kanye?well he's right, FED can't keep printing money and think it will solve all the problems. It's actually causing the problems.

You don't have to look any further than Venezuela to see why endless money printing doesn't work.Not in the best interest of the people handling the national deficit. Oh wait... no ones handling that. We're all good. BrrrrrrrrrrrWhy? It is just paper. Printer goes BrrrrrPlease cause a gigantic dip. I’m ready to btfdElon is playing Texan politics.Then how will be able to fund my Tesla callsSaid the billionaireLink to original tweet: [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1286673686821515266](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1286673686821515266)He put a 🌹 in his twitter name. Great troll hahaShort government bonds$SPY 400 CONFIRMEDHis company runs off government handouts.Which one of you dopes is Brian EckhouseA good part of the rise in Tesla stock IS from the stimulus. People buying up Tesla with that extra $600.Jeez everyone getting cash and I’m over here giving rent reductions.You have to remember Tesla and or space x are filed as LLC or corporations that can use special tax loop holes. On top of that they receive government contracts there for they spend spend all of it tell it’s gone and don’t have to pay any taxes because there really nothing owned and there tax benefits to using all the contracts up. There for receiving more contracts with greater sums and so forth and so forth. I willing to bet if you would go and try and sue Elon that after you got through the lawyer fees and dug deep you would come to find out that he doesn’t own any assets. And your case would be worthless. Everything is written off through these special tax loop holes that almost anyone can do but the average middle class person will never never understand and is why the rich will always stay rich and be taxed less. This so the beauty of America is figuring out how to become rich. You can create anything you want and make millions of dollars from it. You just have to use your brain 🧠 and understand the legal system.Dow nasdaq anything jobs stocks now in

Tesla amazon bubbly stocks gonna go pooffff$3 trillion for 300 million people means $10,000 for every person. But that would cause more inflation. It’s better to give it to some random studies centre or grants to cnnHold on. A stimulus IS FUCKING NEEDED. 

Monetary Policy? Calm it down and respect the fact we've all lost out.

But people will be homeless or dead under Musk's plan. Musk is a few family deaths from Kanye.TrueSays the billionaireSay no more, more TSLA it is!I don’t get how he hasn’t been fucked by the SEC yet lol. Got to love himPapa Elon you disappoint me!Truly the DJ Khaled of business.He CAN say that he's got money. No, we'll need at least 3 more stimulus packages before COVID-19 is done with us.Papa Elon is the best candidate for President of the United States.When does gld hit 200? 😂fuck this weebDread it, run from it, Yang Gang is inevitable. You all will receive $1000 a month, one way or another.i bet he did it on purpose.....The government should just buy everyone a Tesla. ImoStfu Elon.For a genius autist this guy's retardedLolimo the stimulus is only giving people a stronger sense of entitlement. We went from a nation of hardworking motherfuckers to a nation with both hands out waiting for the next distribution. When they don't do when everyone is outraged. I honestly wish they didn't give anyone shit including me. I hear people that used to dog on welfare recipients and now they're complaining they didn't get enough. What happened to pulling up your bootstraps and sticking your cock out there long enough to catch some dinner. I missed out on more than 21k in unemployment because I was stupid enough to go back to work according to all the degenerates sitting at home waiting until the last week of July.

edit: also forgot to add, was sitting down with a tesla model s owner and we did the math. If he had bought tesla stock instead of his S he would have had 5 million buckaroos.Well I guess I’m loosing money. Fuck me sideways...Wtf is he talking about??? Go back to Venus ElonHe's not wrong though.Did anyone explain to Elon that the reason he is not trading at 200 right now is because of that stimulus package?

😂Yes, government disseminating printer output to people won't do the economy (and by extension the people) any good. Shouldn't be a controversial opinion.Can we just pause for a second, Elon is not a fucking god, he runs a car company... getting like brave new world now with the year of our ford on this board..Literally this cunts company would be in the red if it were not for subsidies.

She can only enjoy his massive balls and limp dick for so longAs a result, TSLA gonna tank 1000 today? How can any thinking soul still worship this snake oil salesman?Yeah that 600/week is useless to Elon so he says it’s a bad idea lol. SelfishMadonna said “Papa don’t preach”.........it shoulda been “Elon don’t speak!”he had me in the first halfThis needs to be upvoted more for clarity. Lot of dumbass people on this sub talking out of their ass on this post.The second part doesn't really contradict the first. He still seems to be against government stimulus, but 'if it has to be done' then direct payments is best.Wait so Tesla received  billions in benefits and after he just scored his tax break for his Texas factory now he’s like don’t give money to “special interest groups”? Lol“jammed to gills” = “jacked to the tits” one of usalmost as if he's saying let the people decide who to bail out.That is the problem with tweeting intentions part of the message and get jacked about  and lostat first I was like: he's wrong  


then I saw this and was like: he's rightNah he coulda fit all of that into one fucking tweet. Man did that shit on purpose.>jammed to the gills

Elon Musk half-Martian, half-Atlantean confirmedPapa Elon is right. The last stim pack was a giant pork barrel.original tweet straight from the source: [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1286673686821515266](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1286673686821515266)Wow he said something smart for onceIt took him 17 minutes to get that 2nd tweet out. Someone must have called him up.so he sees us only as consumers.Yes really smart Elon. Inflation is what we need right now..Simple explanation really. Half this sub had their life savings in 2000c expiring today. Now that they are bankrupt they want the stimulus and hate musk. Had their options printed it would be the other way around.Everyone is broke from gambling.. I mean day trading.Honestly I agree with him here. All that $3 trillion should have gone out to consumers to help them ride the tide of corona. Or at least most of it anyways.

Plus it tides in consumerism - more consumer stimulus, and some people are bound to buy his cars.Aye 'consumers' = 'GIVE ME MY MONEY'

America's stimulus is bat shit crazy but Musk just wants his cash.

Hes tweeting this during a debate about unemployment ffsWSB cant read tholol only a billionaire would refer to people as “consumers”He posted an addendum that could have easily fit in the framework of the original tweet almost 20 minutes later. Thats an eternity on the internet. He asked for himself to be taken out of context.I mean Tesla died poor and forgotten, Edison died rich and still made a big impact to the world. I don't see the problem.I read a really good book about those two fuckers recentlyLinus Torvalds: Well, so this is kind of cliché in technology, the whole Tesla versus Edison, where Tesla is seen as the visionary scientist and crazy idea man. And people love Tesla. I mean, there are people who name their companies after him.

The other person there is Edison, who is actually often vilified for being kind of pedestrian and is — I mean, his most famous quote is, "Genius is one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration." And I'm in the Edison camp, even if people don't always like him. Because if you actually compare the two, Tesla has kind of this mind grab these days, but who actually changed the world? Edison may not have been a nice person, he did a lot of things — he was maybe not so intellectual, not so visionary. But I think I'm more of an Edison than a Tesla.

http://www.ted.com/talks/linus_torvalds_the_mind_behind_linux/transcript?language=enHe mentioned that he likes Edison and don't like TeslaI mean ya, Ebhard did kinda found the company and Musk kinda really just bought his position as co-founderYou mean he won’t die a virgin and broke? I’m sure he could live with that.opinions like this one are so fucking cringe, ya'll jerk off to the potential of other men being great leaders when you could try leading your own communities and stop thinking about bullshit like thisHe doesn't want to be Tesla. He \*created\* Tesla, that makes him Tesla's daddy and basically God himself.Eh fuck him, an old chevy caprice will last longer than a model 3, considering you can't get new parts and they fucking rustRead the full comment on his twitter you retard. 

He said he wants direct payments to people and UBI instead of govt stimulus.Elon Musk is someone who actually studied economics and was accepted into Stanford's physics PhD program. He understands how things work.🌈🐻May your retarded TSLA FDs rest in peace.Read the rest of the tweet retard he literally states that he only wants stimulus directly to consumers.He says he is for UBI but opposes direct payments and other stimulus in a pandemic. This guy is a total retard outside his area of expertise.I can't imagine how broken and weak of a person it takes to not even have the attention span to read a second, 256-character tweet.It's almost like there's more to it that you're unable to graspFuck, you are retarded

https://i.imgur.com/Tj5XSSB.jpglol someone got burnt shorting TSLA. And btw: https://i.imgur.com/Tj5XSSB.jpgI don't think it's hypocritical to utilize everything available to you even if you publicly disagree with it. I could want the US to tax everyone more, but I'm not going to mail the IRS extra money every year.Don’t just believe one tweet that’s completely out of context. He’s in favor of UBI instead of one time stimulus checks. The stimulus checks are chalk full of special interest bull crap anyways.The future is already mega fucked though.It ultimately only widens the gap between rich and poor, which was already at all time high pre-corona.I sorta think we should inflate debt away.And no stimulus will fuck over lots of people now. Besides, future generations are already fucked. Further stimulus would only marginally amplify the fuckery they will receive in the futureShut up and buy more stuffSo is another lockdown

Cornona is not that bad.

40% more deaths than an average flu season isn't great, but its not worth the economy, the fabric of society...

The political push for another lockdown is just that, political, done by people who want the current admin out

Just watch if Biden wins in NOV Corona magically stops being fear mongered within two weaks as cases(testing) dropsNo one does, but everyone likes the car he makes and the memes he shares.Everyone likes him because he's beneficial to society, his accomplishments are God-like.Fuck yours!No, the voices in Kanye’s head are advising Kanye.The problem is more complex than that. When a third of the country misses their rent a subsidy must be made to the people. Imagine if every third home, every third apartment became vacant.brrrrrrrrrrrrrrHe wants the stimulus to go directly to people not businesses. So, he supports the 600/week. Seems selfless with contextI pooped in the first half and sucked it back in the second.Someone mind explaining the pros and cons of this and what it means for the autists that are balls deep in Tesla?   


I'm not from the US. My understanding of the repercussions of this is genuinely limited to what mofos from here say.So a typical wsb post.Exactly. Basically his order of preference is

No Stimulus > Direct Payments > Previous Stimulus Package

But the literal autists on this site don't understand the implication of the phrase "if at all" so it gets interpreted in whatever way fits their worldview.LOL waat, he's saying just pay the ppl in a simple bill not combine it all in a VitamixYou see, there's a major difference between companies like Tesla getting special funding, and places like The Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts getting special funding.

The difference is: I own zero shares of The Kennedy Center. Therefore it's crony capitalism to fund them.I mean if it's there might as well take advantage. He's right in the fact that when this is all said and done there will have been another wealth transfer to people at the top. Crony capitalism.So TSLA should choose to be less competitive in the marketplace and get eaten alive by the competition just to prove a point? Elon is allowed to have an opinion on this, but he doesn’t have unilateral say in corporate decisions. The Executives and board are, after all, **theoretically** obligated to increasing shareholder value.Tax breaks are different than bailoutsA tax abatement is not cash in Tesla's pocket.   They just don't have to pay all the property tax.And like 20 min apart, either hes the slowest fucking typer on earth or he did it on purposeHe had to clarify for autists, just look at the initial reactions. Bunch of cry babies mad about potentially not getting free money. Sad that every post needs a disclaimer these days.What do you think the Fed printing $2.7T does?  And how would a direct to consumer payment be more inflationary than the CARES act?smooth brained retardsThis guy fucks.Can you please stop shiting on me dude? Like, what the fuck?^Or buy his stock on RobinhoodI sort of agree too but at the same time a lot of that $3T is gonna be paid back since it was loans

Giving it straight to consumers isn’t a loabbillionaires and anyone speaking in economic terms ever[deleted]Edison don't got a unit bruh nobody cares + tesla got dat waterfallNikola Tesla was the prodigy genius of our entire human existence. Edison, jp morgan, and Westinghouse royally fucked us and Tesla.What was it?You have a lot more to learn about historyTesla is literally named Tesla to pay homage to Nikola Tesla, wtf are you smoking lolHe spread a single thought that fits in one tweet across two tweets like 20 minutes apart... seems he was either covering or being deliberately inflammatoryYeah!His follow up tweet:

“These are jammed to gills with special interests earmarks. If we do a stimulus at all, it should just be direct payments to consumers.”

Congress is packing the stimulus with corrupt goodies for their cronies. Everyone should be against this. But this is how it works in Washington and making the sausage is ugly.He protects his interests. If you’ve ever seen the capitalists under his replies, they’ll follow this dude to the bottom of the ocean and will regurgitate this terrible take.What’s worse is that he thinks he is an expert at everything. 

He just wants everyone back to work so he can crank out cars and sell. Those who buy Teslas aren’t the ones affected right now anyway. Your run of the mill businessman, nothing new.His area of expertise: fraud and twitterThe irony of all of this is that his expertise is exploiting government programs.> his area of expertise.

Which is being a total retard.Read the rest of the post retardIt definitely echoes libertarian investors who want to pick up distressed assets on the cheap. He's trying to come off as a man-of-the-people hero but it's really self interest too: Ford would end up a step closer to bankwuptcy as he predicted would happen in the next recession (now).all tesla critics are burnt short sellers!!!!!!!Here at wsb, we assure that futures are meaningless.Translation: fuck them kidstis a double edged swordIf Corona wasn't that bad, the entire planet wouldn't be bankrupting itself for some prank on the Republicans. More people would have died without treatment and because it's so infectious... why am I explaining this, you don't care.Can confirm, he pushes nerds and engineers to accomplish impossible visions from his mind and is able to raise unlimited funds for them to do so. And he has a **very** solid idea on how to make compelling products that people never knew they wanted. This is why Elon is revered, he's the closest to Steve Jobs in the world today. 


He does a lot of stupid shit, but he's like 20% stupid shit and 80% visionary. It would be like if a WSB person who pulled off 80% of their FDs, then convinced most of WSB to follow him into millionaire status. You wouldn't give a crap about your trades that ended up in a pedo libel lawsuit in that case.Fuck yours!Agreed that is a problem but you have to ask why are they missing their mortgage payments?

The answer to that is complex but simply put it's because we have not had sound monetary policy for a very long time. Growth has been fueled by debt instead of savings. Free markets have not been allowed to work which has created malinvestment. 

The FED actions have not allowed for natural business cycle to occur. Now the FED is actually choosing the winners and losers instead of the market. We are all waking up to the fact that our 401ks are full of garbage companies that don't make money or bring any real value to society.  

We are effectively broke but we haven't realized it yet- but will pretty soon.LolOh ok I didn’t read the full article
Edit: it’s a tweet there’s no article haha but yeah there’s a whole thread of tweets about this from him most likely bc the tweet we’re reading here is a little misleading. I’m sure a lot of people reacted the way I did causing him to clarify thingsMine fully detached and I had to put it back in manually.Fucking OP trying to trick everyone. 

Elon literally said pay people directly instead of this shady stimulus shit.the economy runs on people buying stuff

so people make or sell stuff and get money.

corona virus meant people panics and stopped buying stuff they didn't need.

some people.did because they were scared. or they lost their jobs or they just didn't want to buy things that weren't safe to use.

to combat this the us started gifting people money so they could buy stuff without being scared of their job as much.

after that the government decided that it was better to give companies the money instead of the average person. so companies got money and they super duper promised not to use the money for anything but paying their employees.

so most companies still fired their employees and used the money as a loan.

musk Is saying that it was better to just give money to the average person instead of companies. and he is right. give a company a billion and there is no gurantee they use it immediately. but give a person $600 and they are likely spending it within a year, or more likely a month.Aren’t really any repercussions because the people going off on him on twitter aren’t the ones buying his products.

He is getting more spotlight among certain politicians that will put him on next to Bezos and fuck him long termA big issue with the last stimulus package is that PPP loans meant for small businesses ended up going to multi-million dollar businesses instead, many of the loans went to places or industries that weren't hit hard by the virus, and the money ran out within a few weeks anyways. [Source.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paycheck-protection-program-small-businesses-large-companies-coroanvirus/) Republicans are also pushing for stuff like reducing payroll tax - ostensibly because employers would pass on the benefits to their employees. Realistically, lots of businesses would just pocket the money and save it away as their profits. This would do very little to help the economy, although it would help prevent businesses from failing.  

If we really want to stimulate the economy, we need more people out spending money. Cutting taxes for wealthy business owners helps a little, but giving that money directly to the people would result in lots more spending. There's record high unemployment right now, people aren't spending money because they're broke or using their rainy day funds already. Businesses would benefit a lot from this policy because they'll have a lot more customers. Less people would also be defaulting on loans and mortgages or skipping rent, resulting in a more stable economy. This is what Elon is proposing. 

As for why he's saying this, the last stimulus package was mostly geared towards the restaurant and hospitality industries. Big companies outside of those industries - like Tesla - got no benefit from it. If the next stimulus package went directly to ordinary people there would probably be more people willing to spend money on big ticket items like cars.It shouldn't really mean anything for people balls deep in tesla.  On the other hand if people get their hands on a few hundred bucks, maybe they make a down payment on a shiny M3.Zero percent chance the plebs get a check unless the elite get their beaks wet. Elon knows this better than anyone"If we do a stimulus at all..."

It's like my fiance going, "If we have sex tonight at all...it will be missionary with the lights off"

Neither of them really seem into the idea.Yes, but you might want to take someone special (ie high class hooker) for tendies then some special take on the Nutcracker at said Kennedy Center and if it's not there to entertain them, then you'll look like a tendie eating gimp and end up fucking yourself, so there's that.I do see your point. However, I may own shares in other special interest groups that may benefit from the stimulus and until I see the stimulus bill I won’t say that it’s crony capitalism or not.Lol well played.Kennedy Center has daily free concerts, I can’t take my boyfriend’s boyfriend to a free concert at Teslabut don't you see, if we dont support the kennedy center for performing arts, the sjw screechers won't have a home, and so they'll take to the streets coming after our tendies in the form of anti trustYah and he’s part of that.

Source of He didn't come up with the name.

Dumb fuckDude. He bought that company and he mentioned that he would named different if he make that company. You need to know your history right retardHe's Elon Musk, of course he was being deliberately inflammatory.I figured this was going to happen.  They'll tack on all sorts of shitty legislation and people won't care cause they gonna get paid>Congress is packing the stimulus with corrupt goodies for their cronies.

Sources?  Its not that I don't believe you, I just wanna read about this.His follow up tweet was posted 16 minutes after the first one, I wonder why that was if it was actually one thought over two tweets...> If we do a stimulus at all

Is the important partSenate not congressThis is not true and even if there were 100 billion of special interest goodies in there it doesnt outweigh the benefit of the necessary payments.This is why democracy is unironically a huge mistake.> He just wants everyone back to work so he can crank out cars and sell.

All the other automakers are laying off people, Have you heard anyone being laid off from Tesla? You can't have it both ways.Run of the mill business men don’t send people to the international space station. Or build the first reusable rocket.

He even said himself that if all he cared about was money then he wouldn't start a car or space company, he'd do an internet one again. The industries he chose aren't known for making easy profits, his companies almost went bankrupt. Run of the mill businessmen don't get accepted to Stanford's physics PhD program nor do they start innovative, futuristic companies.

Autists will never fully comprehend this.Fuck yoursYou're lucky that the world runs on US dollars so before you go broke everyone else will and when every other economy has contracted to 30% of its original output then it will be your zurnUnauthorized pinching 👎 👎 👎.BruhWait, so the companies didn't use the money to help their employees and instead fired them anyway?

Wow. I'm shocked.Well fuck me. I genuinely thought the money going to businesses was intended for them to just continue paying employees while the business was shut down and that people who weren't receiving that got something like $1500 in the last stimulus.Why is it so backwards in the US. Here in AU, the stimulus goes straight to the consumers and the gov is even paying wages for employers hold their jobs. If consumer cash is spent, the gov can keep collecting taxes over and over.Alright, now do this, money goes to consumer, consumer buys product, money goes to producer. Producer still fires their employees because they recognize that there isn’t an endless stream of money coming. So now you still have the outcome of directly giving to producers. The goal was to mitigate lay offs, which was done. They accomplished that both through the loans and by giving directly to consumers. It wasn’t meant to be an endless money supply, it was meant to buy a few months, it did that. We’ll see what happens next.I've already written off 2x BMWs lol I dont want another. The goal is to be rich enough to afford a cyber truck in a couple years, I'm happy on a my bike for now xDI literally didn't understand a fuckin word of what you just said - but I agree with you 100000%Skip the nutcracker and give me the hooker>Bread and Circus

This is actually sage adviceIt's not hypocritical. It would be hypocritical if he said that people should not take advantage of the offers they are given. Instead, he is saying that the system should not be making these offers. He is saying this even though he is a top beneficiary of these advantages. If anything, he is being *more righteous* than his peers, and you clowns that are muddying the waters by misrepresenting the truth of the situation are as harmful as you are illogical.I mean if he's getting away with it, it's not his fault.  It's the system's fault.  He can point out the system is broken while still benefiting from the broken system.  It's not like he can fix it himself.Or he's allowed to disagree with something even if he benefits? They're not mutually exclusiveOr he can take the money and tweet this. Because that is what any sane, successful person would do. You play the game to the best of your ability within the rules, and if you don't like the rules you're free to bitch about them in the hopes said bitching will influence change.Imagine believing the CEO of a company can singlehandedly make decisions decided by an entire corporation.Or he takes the money and does tweet this..Retard, I don't agree with $1200 stimulus check but I got one. 

You think I am going to give that $ away just because I don't agree with the decision?

You are so dense it hurts.The Tesla tax break has nothing to do with bailouts, so no they usually arentHeard she did a lot of screwing[deleted]Not everyone seems to understand hes a dirty trollWe get paid $1,200. Businesses get billions. Fair trade man.probably just business loans and relief that will disproportionately help political donorsHere's one: [https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/26/stimulus-coronavirus-special-deals-151108](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/26/stimulus-coronavirus-special-deals-151108)I mean have you not read all the shit about the first round of PPPs ?

Suddenly everyone working for Trump had family members approved for millions in loans/grants. . .  

The fact that the WH doesnt want to disclose who the loans / grants went to and the fact that the WH wants to convert the loans to grants instantly for the donors of the Trump campaign. . .Twitter?Do you not know how to use Twitter?Because he had to clarify for autists getting outraged. Just look in this thread about how many people are crying about free money not being handed out.He might be a pretty busy person.Also he could have easily fit both thoughts into 1 tweetCongress is bicameral.lol thinking the House isn't just as corrupt because you favor the political party that currently controls it.Congress includes the house and the Senate and both had their hands on the stimulus package.He didnt do that, the engineers that work for his companies did that. And tax payer money funded a majority of it.Honestly it's so simple that it has to be by design. There's actually no other explanation besides corruptionThe nutcracker is the hooker, my friend. But it’ll cost extrathe smooth brains won't listen, the cycle repeatsLol what. Musk supporters are too funny. 

His tweet said “Another”. So you’re essentially saying that he is more righteous for taking it in the first batch and then saying that that’s enough and no one should benefit AFTER this batch. Lmao. What about the people who missed out the first batch? 

I guess your implicit assumption is that it’s going to be same people receiving the handouts. Not sure, how you can see into the future but okay.They should appoint someone to make the important decisions. Some sort of chief of all the executives.Imagine believing the CEO of a company can’t make decisions on behalf a corporation.Imagine not realizing the clout of personality behind Elongated Muskrat, Meme Rhetorician.Who said anything about giving it away? Lmfao. 

Retard, read what I said. I said it’s hypocritical to tweet about it. Please explain to me with the whole 2 brain cells you have how it’s not. Or is it only 1 left?I find this comment hilarious but only because i've been following the stock for a while. If you would hear what the shorts have been parroting for 3 years, it's almost verbatim what you just said. (they are all broke now)Yeah, don’t think about the thousands more you’ve paid in taxes only to get most of it handed to corps when we’re all fucking dying of COVID.

Fantastic deal kekwIn a week that might get me a piece of that sweet $TSLA pie.You still use Twitter? lolNot even about being autistic. The first tweet taken on its own has no room for misinterpretation. Dude was baiting.If he has the time to post the first tweet, he has the time to post the second one as well before fucking off to do something elseSorry you’re right I had a brain fartThat’s the dumbest thing I ever heard. That’s how owning a company and government contracts work.
Elon is the chief engineer at SpaceX. He hires people to build his vision. That’s what entrepreneurs do. Do you think Jeff Bezos built the facilities that hold all the products amazon sells? No, but it’s his company and he gets the credit for it. You are just salty.I don’t remember him ever coming out and saying he needed the stimulus the first time? That’s different him simply using what was made available by government to help his companies be more profitable.>Musk supporters are too funny.

Wtf?

> So you’re essentially saying that he is more righteous for taking it in the first batch and then saying that that’s enough and no one should benefit AFTER this batch 

I don't think that is what's being said at all.

Musk haters are too funny.

> I guess your implicit assumption is that it’s going to be same people receiving the handouts. 

That's Musk's implication, not mine. It becomes clear in the 2nd tweet when he clarifies that he thinks the next stimulus should be a consumer stimulus.

I don't understand why you don't understand that a CEO's business prerogative and their personal ethics do not always align. If a CEO doesn't go after every tax break available to him to maximize his shareholder's profits, he will not be the CEO of that company for much longer.

You're being purposefully ignorant and it's weird. You could be talking about how it's bullshit that all these handouts are going to these megacorporations while the consumer class is being left out to dry but instead you're smearing a dude with a platform who actually is bothering to say these things.imagine believing we know how to readr/WhoooshImagine being unable to comprehend the fact that, if innovative companies - which benefit the most from the free market and least from government stimulus - chose to refuse government benefits they are entitled to that other, less innovative and self sufficient companies are taking already, they will become less competitive in the marketplace and less able to survive as a corporation. 

Just because someone believes the rules of a game ought to be changed, does not mean that they ignore the existing rules and play the game according to their preferred rules. In a similar vein, it’s possible for a millionaire to believe his effective tax rate OUGHT to be higher, for him to support the tax structure to become more progressive, and support/vote for the politicians that are running on that platform. But that doesn’t mean he will send the government an extra $500,000 than the current tax code expects of him.Do you retards not know about shareholder voting rights? What did you think stocks are good for, just trading? No, not correct smooth brain. Many stocks (TSLA included) have voting rights. Of course your say only really matters if you have a large stake in the company, but the point is, the company and its employees (including the CEO) *have* to follow the shareholder desires. That's the trade off with going public... after all, you *do* own a portion of the company when you buy the stock.It's the same concept retard.

Elon took advantage of what was available to him like I cashed in my check when it was sent to me. I never claimed about giving away but you suggested that Elon is a hypocrite for taking advantage of cheap loans that were offered to him.

You are such a moron that the concept that he should do what's best for his business despite not agreeing with the government policy is not going through your head.We're also getting 100 million free doses of vaccine from Pfizer. Who is getting 1.9B.  I'm not sure how money is exchanged if it's free but ya know....Yes, so I don’t have to ask people to search it for me.Lol at this guy trying to make it seem like using Twitter is "dated" or "uncool". 

All of your favorite celebrities with way more money then you are on there.I agree Jeff Bezos isn't a brilliant engineer and isnt the one who did any of the amazing things at amazon. He's a run of the mill businessman who uses people to make money and could care less about you or me, the same as musk. Naming himself chief engineer is evidence of nothing other than his ego. Keep praying at the altar of musk my retarded friend.Okay so adapting your example: 

A cigarette company CEO should non stop tweet about regulating cigarettes more seriously and applying more regulation. Seeing as how your belief is his business prerogative and personal ethics don’t have to align. 

I’m not sure I can follow your logic:
(1) so a CEO has a fiduciary duty to maximize benefit for their shareholders: yet,
(2) the same CEO should tweet about not getting  benefits anymore in the future? 

How does that fiduciary duty not extend to the tweets? Lmao. How can you have it both ways? 

Musk is literally the only person who can break fiduciary duty and shareholders just move the goal posts and continue to suck him off. 

Stop dude. LolTwatter is normie shit now.  It is absolutely uncool unless you're a fucking boomer.

And what sort of fucking emasculated soy-drinking pawn actually cares whatever the fuck "celebreties" choose to do with their time?  I could care less what those corporate puppets or their pedophilic bosses endorse.  In fact, I base my entire existence around doing the opposite of whatever the fuck preachy, degenerate "celebreties" lecture me about.I don’t have one favourite celebrity- I’m not a child lolWhat /u/weak_gift said.  You have favorite celebrities?

I mean, I follow some strongmen, but they're all on Instagram because Twitter is garbage.I don't think you can call the founders of some of the largest companies on the planet "run-of-the-mill businessmen" and retain any credibility...Do you have any idea of how a company works you absolute moron? CEOs can't be sitting in the basement welding stuff together.

Musk is directly responsible for 1000s of decisions over 10-15 years which have got Tesla and SpaceX where they are. That is his job.he was investigated by the SEC for those tweets my friend, specifically because he was raising questions about that fiduciary responsibility. in an uncharacteristically forward-looking move, everyone kinda just agreed that the allowing this guy to tweet antagonistic lunacy was worth the risk. this is not the same as it's okay for CEO's to literally burn millions of dollars in tax breaks and government handouts.

i don't even know why i'm talking to you, there is no way you are actually this retarded, unless you're some high school twat. more likely you are just *feeling some type of way* and you're trying to justify your *feelings* but i don't really care to talk about your *feelings* anymore.You live in a fantasy world. The narrative you just spouted is made up. Make believe. Not true. 

If you don't like Twitter, that's fine. No one is requiring you to use it. But lying to yourself, that only boomers use Twitter and nobody young, hip or cool does? That's bullshit. You truly belong here,  you're actually retarded.Thats fair. I guess they are extraordinary businessmen. Point taken.I dont think calling me an absolute moron was neccessary but cool bro. The above argument that I was debating "run of the mill businessmen dont put people in space or launch resuable rockets". If the argument isn't they literally did that, then the argument he was making in that statement is invalid which was what i was trying to point out. Elon is just a businessman.Wait but you still have explained how the fiduciary duty doesn’t extend to the tweets about stimulus and how it wouldn’t violate fiduciary duty if because of these tweets the government decides to not extend stimulus. 

And now you’ve resorted to personal insults. Lmaooooo 

Too funny.>The narrative you just spouted is made up. Make believe

Hmm.. Do you have an example of what I just "made up?"  You  absolute troglodyte..

>But lying to yourself, that only boomers use Twitter and nobody young, hip or cool does? That's bullshit.

Lmfao.  Someone literally getting defensive over Twitter.  You really are a cuck for your brands, aren't you?  My God, pretentious "options traders" who know nothing about what they're doing are the worst..  Enjoy the red, loser.I can't even take what you write seriously because you do it in such a condescending way.

You need the help. Godspeed.Well it’s intentional considering how the comment chain went towards the personal insult direction.As I've imagined, absolutely no example, no ability to logic or reason through a debate.  Just deperately tries to slander his opponents as crazy.  I bet many, many people you've come across in life hold the collective belief that you're an absolute fucking cockroach.  I have a hard time believing you're only that sleazy online.  What a parasitic loser you are telling someone they should think what celebreties think because they "make much more money" and going on a spastic attack over someone pointing out that Twitter is uncool.  I'd like to think your worthlessness goes back generations, but I can't help but feel that you're just a runt and that your parents never had any respect for you anyway.  You'll never amount to any tendies at all; you're an absolute fucking joke of a person and I'd wager that  everybody feels this way about you but are too afraid to admit it.You had an opportunity to take the high road and make a more effective counter-point. There is a lot to take away from Musks's actions. He could have kept the money and said nothing, like most other companies that took it.It is what it is :(Oh my god, RIP Facebook and TwitterI dunno, why can’t we tell socialists a joke?Twitter drops 2%😂He’s such a fucking jack ass, I love itElon for presidentWhat Communist unit of time is abbreviated "t"?I'm curious about what sort of changes he'd recommend to make it betterPeople thinking he means twitter itself sucks instead of making fun of commie Twitter are retardedPapa Musk , please spank me.Papa Musk picked up smoking a few months into his seventh kid.

Feel free to downvote the messengerCalled ithe’ll replace us with robots i’m voting against thisIt’s Norwegian. 1 hour = 1 time (tee-muh).He’s posted interesting thoughts about news organizations vetted by independent networks, I wouldn’t put it past him to fund a twitter competitor meant to also function as a up-to-the-minute organic news source. Easier to theorize about than to implement... but will be watching if he decides to create or fund something himself.

We're all just sending electrons back and forth so we have something to kill the time. Has there been any real difference in your life over the past few days as that squiggly line has gone down? Probably not. There is a lot of time between now and the time you actually need that money. So turn off the screen, have a beer, rub one out, and come back Monday to start working on getting that squiggly line to go back up.I highly recommended that you take the 21k out of the trading account. If you have open positions, stocks or options, close them on Monday "as is". No yolos or waiting them to turn around. Then talk to someone about it. 

The reason to pull out cold turkey is that the behavior that brought you here is probably going to propagate to your next trades and you will lose it all.

It will be okay. Yes, $200k is a lot of money, but at the end of the day, that is all it is money. It will be okay buddyI also blew up my portfolio this week. Being stupid down 95% about 35k lost. I know it’s not 200 but I feel your pain man. 

Just keep your chin up until the depression washes over you and goes away and try to focus on life’s simple pleasures. 

Lay in bed for a day/week/month and try to get back in that horse!21k? Bro trade spreads 3 times per week you make like 4K per tradeRule number 1: DON'T GAMBLE WITH MONEY THAT YOU AREN'T WILLING TO LOSE.

OP, take this lesson to heart. Your life will go on. 21k is more money than I have. Take that out, play it safe, take a hard look in the mirror, and then move forward.Man you have 21k more than most other people, you came by it some how you will again.

Is money worth ending your existence over?
People love you and care about you, it’s gone now.. they care about you and want you, don’t take it away from them, if you kill yourself they will die too, forever asking if they could have done something, is that fair ?Before investing in $ROPE try gofundme.GLD leaps and please don't kill yourself.Noice. True WSB.Damn.. well on the bright side, If you come to Tennessee you can fuck my wife. She’s not even half bad.Bro you lost 237k ? I would fucking go gray headed after that 🤦‍♂️ hope you’re alrightthe right thing to do was sell cash secured puts. I did that shit on WFC last wednesday or w/e when they tanked earnings. Those puts went worthless the next day. Theta gang always winsHave you tried yoloing some more money? I mean i have no idea how stocks work. So definitely yolo it.Nobody wants to lose money. But money is not everything my man. Don’t check your accounts or tickers and shit this weekend. 

Do you have any capital left? I’m not a big fan of yolo. So I’m gonna suggest starting out again with safe bets (like only stonks, no options perhaps) for a few weeks to earn some money and confidence back.Everything is going to be good brother, you made that money in the first and you’ll be able able to do it again.I started with 14k and I'm down 80%...clearly not anywhere close to your numbers but still a big hit to me. Take a few days off or park the remainder in a stock for a bit youll come back. I hear that helps... I just spent my last 3k on a tesla put today though so I'm not taking my own advice.   Aight ima head out.Hey man!  As bad as life sometimes might seem you must remember that every dark cloud has a silver lining. 

The negative thing you have here is reversible however some of the actions you have mentioned in your post are very irreversible. Please remember to choose the reversible options that you can always fix and work on. 

I wish you all the luck, wealth, and happiness. We care about you.How did you get 227k in the first place?Yes, it’s a huge loss but if you are still breathing and have a job everything will be ok.  We all make emotional decisions and this market is a fomo thirst trap.  Everyone is posting gains then the sideline tries to duplicate when the top and earnings are priced in. Fuck it man I was broke before becoming a professional and filled up my car with gas from the spare change in my ashtray.  All will be fine brother.  Lessons are learned and be cautious of Stocktwits, Reddit and these MM manipulators.  You have a fraternity here at wallstreetbets and life would not be the same without you.  Now like the other dude said, have a beer, rub one out and get back on the horse!dont fucking invest in $ROPE paperhands, gotta polish those diamonds and do it again for the memes.

but really dude, it sucks but at the end of the day life is precious, stocks are just one part of a life that is beautiful and is cherished. your life is more valueable than any tendies you didnt get during the TSLA call option pump.

Esp in this market.  Don't blame yourself hope better days ahead.I bet NIO would go down shorted it 45 days ago. Today there was a window about 15 min duration. Did not expecting making dough. Rather I lost -$14. Fourteen bucks loss. Contract expires today.If you could acquire that amount of cash, you can do it again.YOLO the 21k on $3500 sep callsSwitch to SQQQ and watch the bubble burst, boy-oSir, this is a soup kitchen.Take a weekend to go relax dude, spend some of that 21k on a nice hotel for a couple of days and don’t look at your account.Don't be serious about $ROPE. You gotta stay alive to play another YOLO.  You can't do that if you do $ROPE.  Work and save some some cash, then try YOLOs again.If you manage to make 237k you can definitely make it back little by little rope ain't gonna help you with that. I am in a shitty spot too so i feel you, don't let it take you down, write down the stupid decisions you made so you don't make them again.Why would you rope yourself over monopoly money that JPow can always just print more of?I made 430k daytrading small + mid caps from a $4300 account in a matter of 5 months. I lost $230k and I know how you feel rn. I’m slowly getting back that profit one day at a time. It took 4 bad tickers to make me lose $230k. There’s always a way back as long as you keep trying to figure it out.You have more than enough to climb back out! 
DONT DOUBT UR VIBE,  KEEP DOING, 
THIS WILL BE A PAST MEMORY ONE DAY!!!Fbro we have fucking BANKRUPTCY you can make this disappear into thin air and in 7 years it never happened  


never have a permanent solution to a temporary problem....but bro you need help, this is as stupid and irresponsible as it gets and you're bound to fuck yourself sideways in a different way later

&#x200B;

at least give professional help a try firstAt the end of the day, just tell yourself it’s paper.It’s just money man, there are worse tragedies in life. This will pass 🤙Quit trading, It's not for everyone. Too many people out here treating the market like a casino, or trading options without even understanding it.Don't permanently realize your losses by going long $ROPEJust wait until these retards push the market to pop, then buy in with reasonable positions and hold on forever.  It's worked for me. This will be my 4th crash and I've averaged about 15% annually. Not big yearly gains but good enough to have a couple mil at 40Man if you were up that much before youll get there again. Sit back, take a walk, clear your head, snort some blow, have some fun, blow off some steam, come back sober, kill it.Chris Sacca went negative a few million and he came back from it. Things will get better.Sir, this is a euro poor.Listen, you're in a hole. It's fine. You can dig your way out.

Remember, death is an irreversible solution to a reversible problem.This is the fuckin shit that gets me through the day! Love it. Thanks for making me feel better at my losses as I jerk off to this tonight. Down like 22k since March, but don’t think that’s worthy enough to share with the big boys here. I’ll wait until I’m down at least 50k before you ever hear about my losses here. Thanks again man for sharing!In all seriousness, I’m assuming most of the losses of the past week are house money. You’ve lost some winnings chasing a dragon. You’ve still got more in your trading account than most people have savings. Take a breather, no panic trades, relax and enjoy life for a bit. Get refreshed and either take that account back to the moon or if it is something that you’re feeling is a problem, cash it out.I lost $97k on digital currency (f the auto mod) trying to move in and out of alt coins and then shorted the bottom.  Also tried shorting this rally and moved a lot of money out of my 401k and Roth at 2700. I probably lost 150k all in all. It sucks to know what that would be worth in retirement but you will get through it. You need to limit your position sizes to amounts that you can stand to lose, that allows you to hold through the rough until the position rebounds. Otherwise you will try to cut your loses too quick out of fear of losing more. What I did learn from it is a greater appreciation for what is really important in life and that's your friends/family and experiences with them. Money helps do those experiences but it doesn't create them on it's own. It's you that creates those treasured moments, and without you those moments will never happen. You will get through it, take a couple days to cry it out, talk to your loved ones about it, don't try to hide it, and work on doing things in life that make you happy. Best of luck.Oof. I blew about $100k, not fun but you will recover. Def take a break and stay the hell away from short dated options.Just buy BA calls whenever it hits 173 cant go tits upDood, eat some comfort food and then parlay this into a best-selling book.  I think you have a good story to tell.Who cares? You made a mistake and that’s okay it’s part of life. It’s not ideal and it might throw your plans for life off a little bit it’s just numbers on a screen. Stop trading, you’ll be alright. Take the 21k, and do what you can, ideally not trading. Whatever you do, do not revenge trade. Best of luck, Godspeed.I think you want to go short $ROPE

Just sayingI’ll catch ya in the next one brother.Hang in there money won't mean anything after the asteroid hits.You sold your shares for a 40k loss? Not even options?at least you're not down 100% on the bright sideAll the hugboxing comments are making me gag. This sub has really gone down the shitter.sounds like you're finished with broker training for Edbird Chones, good luck with your new career.  For realz tho, $rope is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.  Look how many times Donny pump blew up and he became the fuckin PrezidentMANY MANY MANY people don’t have $21,000 to their name.21K is 5x more money than I got ! And I'm having a helluva fun time playing with options. Wouldn't I kill to have 21K !!??

God speed to your 21x10=210K journey.Didn’t you post a $140k loss a week ago?Take few months off then come back1-800-273-8255 if you need help.

Don’t make permanent choices for temporary problemsYou are in a margin call. Your account has been flagged as a PDT account. Please deposit 4k to meet the minimum requirement of 25k.If you feel bad remember there is a guy on WSB who lost 4 MILLION USD not too long ago. Think about that.you had shares brother, you see intel go down that much don't panic either hold on and wait or buy more at the bottom. Truly retarded but hey you'll comeback from this dumbassYolo amd jan21 90cBefore you $ROPE care to donate your leftovers?LmfaoThis is the way.Take some time out and build some cash, rest them eyes. When your down listen to the retarded voice in your ear saying...get up, get up you artistic son of bitch because WSB loves ya! We ain’t stopping to we got every last fucking dollar yeh 👍Look on the bright side... You only need a 1,029% return to get back to where you once were. Only takes one FD to achieve. Look at AMD OTM FDs today. Up 13,000% on some of them.Repeat after me : FUCK MY SOFT PAMPER TISSUE HANDSbuy PRPL 30c 8/21Relax my dude. Buy some leap calls some gold and you'll be back to 200 easy. Stop doing insane high risk plays. Go get a beer get laid you'll be fine. 90 percent loss ain't shitIf it makes you feel any better.. I lost 20 bucks once[deleted]Do it pussy!

You need to wear your shame proudly. First step is tell whoever you're hiding this from that you lost a lot of money, but don't need to actually tell them the truth. Blame it on the China virus, something no one could have predicted.  

At this point the deep pain should have subsided.

Staring down the barrel of a gun, metaphorically, can be one of the most freeing human experiences.  You are now truly free to do whatever you want in this world.  Go outside and sucker punch someone.  Book a flight somewhere.  Grab some assault rifle and shoot up another country music concert in Vegas. Whatever you want to do, you're now free of all social contracts.  If you don't want to do anything that hurts anyone else, that's fine too, the ball is finally back in your court.See yaLmao I soo don't want to be you right nowNobody tell him

He's able to come up with 6 figure liquidity, won't help him to lose it again.Like in the movie margin call, which is a really good move BTW. The guy at the end of it says “Its just money; its made up. Pieces of paper with pictures on it so we don't have to kill each other just to get something to eat.”This. OP sounds like he has a gambling addiction.Maybe you should remove that last sentenceNot guaranteed, this would be hard to comeback from but not impossibleLost 24k here, still grinding and learning how to make money everyday. If I were him I would just buy some calls 2021 on something he believes in and go see a psychiatrist. Most chads in here prlly would never consider seeing a psychiatrist but it saved my lifeFor real, wait for a vaccine then all in on BA or something, there are so many obvious calls to make every year it just takes patience and the occasional mistake.Selling spreads?What's the best broker for this and how do I get started?I don't like your user nameYep.

This sub is all about busting each other's balls and laughing at those who make poor decisions, but sometimes some of us make decisions out of desperation or addiction and the consequences can be devastating. Other times, it can just be a string of bad luck. In times like these we have to lose the autist mentality and look after one another because when it comes down to it, this is all just a big game and anyone can lose. There's always a tomorrow. We want you here for it.Or just sell premium. With 200K, he could have made nice returns by just wheeling. When you've already got bank like that, you're better off *being* the casino, rather than playing into it.Damn now I gotta go watch that movie. Thanks for the recommendation!I wouldn’t even say gambling, this was likely just full panic.

Risk defined trades.Anything besides Robinhood.Don't hate before tryingNot remotely.  Even a 10 second look through the guy’s post history shows he has a habit of talking about losses not being big enough to qualify as “loss porn.”  This post is for the karma.  He’s not serious.  He knew what he was doing.Who the actual cuntfuck is that>The rest was past balance lost over the last weeks. I'm actually bankrupt and I might consider $ROPE.

God I can't believe i got in before this pump. Literally bought on wednesday because of the initial pump breakout. DIdn't expect intc to shit the bed.

Couldn't have just been because of the new chips.Doo doo heheNice, how did you create that fancy computer bubble thingy ?YepSounds a little biased. HCA HealthcareYepProbablyBubble go up good money, bubble go down bad moneyThat small bubble at the end in technology sector is the result of NKLA and INTL getting fucked in their anusesFirstEnergy, bribery scandalHCA HealthcareThese are not the calls you’re looking forNot just the callings, but the putlings and spreadlings tooFeel like the lightsaber should have "IV Crush" rather than "TSLA 2020 Earnings"I mean the memes are strong with this one, but Elon is really not to blame.But he said the stocks too high....Think about this meme in a historical context for just a second. People studying this moment in time will probably look back at memes like this and similar ones. History in the making here, folks.I like the rainbow fontBrillianceElon pleasePsssh still droppingTook the mask off as a last fuck you to musk. Spread them germs.The SEC will decide your fate.Looks like cheap calls to me.BUT THE CONFETTI!!Not the younglings! 
The autistic, fully retarded younglings...The poor RH younglings...people acting like it's elon's fault they lost money trading TSLA through earnings. lulwould have been better without panel 1Elon ApprovesThis was in good taste, IMONKLA shot firstLOLYesssss! High quality commentIV crush had the high ground.Truth, switch it to a hedge fund manager deciding to burn the economy versus get screwed this Friday. 

Seriously though, I'd love to see a comparison of the value of short positions on tech stocks expiring 7/31 versus the damage that has been done to the market. Seems like it would be worthwhile to tank things for a few days at the cost of a few billion versus letting $30 billion expire otmHistory is always in the making.I am the SEC.You need to make this meme ASAPI’d buy you gold if I wasn’t holding a bunch of EV meme stock calls.wsb retard:

u may have the high ground but im highIV crush is too high imoDude it will be the exact same thing as always happens.

1."hurr durr stonks never drop btfd lol dumbass"

2."Lol wtf is going my portfolio is dropping gay bears are wrong fuck you"

3."Fuck i lost 90% of my portfolio gay stocks gonna go do sport betting or fantasy. If i wanted to throw away money I would play lottery"

4."Lol dude I don't care that stocks are undervalued economy is shit and I don't want to wait a year to make money I have better shit to do"

5.Come back to 1 and repeat.

Retail always goes hyper FOMO at/close to top, bails out at the bottom with emotional scars, misses out on all the undervaluation because of said scars and only goes back in when the next bull market is already in a bubble stage. I know this because I already fell for this shit once.yup. the amount of shitty DDs i see is astounding. didnt we have an amzn pumper just a few minutes ago who said amzn 3500c 07/31 will print with the single justification that ecommerce has soared amidst the pandemic? what an idiot.Don't take any advice from redditors either.What if I grew my account from $500 to $0?TL;DR 

New traders annoy me and I wish them financial hardship as a result.look at the etrade, ameritrade, etc earnings reports ... there are about 6-8 million trades going on daily from retail across the big brokers ....

that is an ABSURD number for the "slow months" of the year ..

this is 100% driven by retail and market makers are just reactionary ... billionaires are not buying ... 

I believe next week we will have the same thing happen to AMZN/FB/APPL/GOOG that happened to NFLX and MSFT, which will drill team 6Trading is like Poker on steroid. Easy to learn, but extremely hard to master.FuCkInG NoRmIeS, gEt OuT oF mY MaRkEtI am already depressedya'll were kids or not even born in 1999. everyone was literally  shilling the next big IPO, and every IPO was +200% on day one, +100% day two etc etc. 

wanna see some gore look at a max chart  of $JNPRWhy do people who started trading not all that long ago get their panties all in a bunch when new people start trading? At what point do you become a trader and not a “trader”? One year? Two years? One YouTube video? Six? Do you get a certificate from Warren Buffet?You might feel like a guru some days and a complete failure other days. Times change and styles of investing that work change.  

The stock market is the long game(even if you are doing short trades), you need to change and move with it otherwise you lose everything including the belief in yourself.People I know who stated in the past, “the stock market is a scam” are now on robinhood buying GNUS stock and bragging about how they are working on their “side hustle”

I agree.

So. Fucking. Annoying.I did lose all my parents money on teslaThe tik tok traders and the amount of fb ads I’m getting for traders is fkin ridiculous man...
I’m really tempted to get in on the scam.. but even though I believe in an amoral universe I somehow hold on to judeo Christian morales (not all let’s not go into that)
Fk sake men are making bank by telling people to long eur usd and putting up pics of Ferrari’s on instaPeople that take advice from IG and TikTok are the type of people that take advice from IG or TikTok lol its a redundant post you might aswell take a piss in the windI think we see a lot of profit taking with the big boys doing earning next week and the spiral starts 🌈🐻Bane: Ah, you think Reddit is your ally?https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-spot-stock-market-bubbles-2017-10


>Like for virtually anyone invested in the stock market, the 1920s were good to Joseph Kennedy Sr.  How could they not be, all you had to do was buy all the stock you could and watch it go up.

>After having made a bundle owning stocks in the roaring bull market of the 1920’s, Joe Kennedy Sr. found himself needing to get his shoes polished up.

>While sitting in the shoeshine chair, Kennedy Sr. was alarmed to have the shoeshine boy gift him with several tips on which stocks he should own — yes, a shoeshine boy playing the stock market.

>This unsolicited advice resulted in a life-changing moment for Kennedy Sr. who promptly went back to his office and started unloading his stock portfolio.

>In fact, he didn’t just get out of the market, he aggressively shorted it — and got filthy rich because of it during the epic crash that soon followedWouldn't that be nice.  I'm really sick of seeing "DD" that basically reads:  "Listen up faggots, blah blah Donnie Pump, JPOW, gay bears, stonks only go up.  Retards, my position: 2 contracts of AMD 8/21 100c">and never come back

They always come back. 

Casinos know this and they openly run a physical place where people literally spend their own time going to a casino to play a game that's rigged against them for the sole purpose of taking their hard earned money.

Stock market is at least mostly fair with a growing pie where it's pretty much a guarantee win if you put money into a large cap index fund. That's before factoring the fact that worldwide governments are all going BRRRRR with their printers.did u know if u buy shares you can buy puts and if the market crashes you only lose the money you spent on the put shit's crazy but trueSorry bro you're wrong and your ignorance is extremely telling. History always repeats itself.

1920s -> roaring twenties. 

Why? Because it was the twenties.

What decade are we in now? Oh yea, the twenties. Get fucked on loser.you know we have reached critical mass... when every shoeshine boys think they are fn Michael BurryIf you have reached the age of majority and need to be reminded not to take financial advice from Instagram and Tiktok personalities, you deserve to lose every dime just like us.What’s the big deal with newbies getting in, why do you care that others get in and lose their money. The market isn’t a special club that requires any skill or special knowledge it’s always been about luck and that’s how it’s supposed to be, if people want to speculate why does it matter. We should embrace it and exploit it, not just wine that the instagram influencer is doing it too.  This stupid mentality of ‘too many retail people it’s all going to hell’ is retarded embrace it and dump your bags on them and move on.And every youtube channel is sponsored by WeBull... "open a trading account now and get two free stocks!"i cant fucking wait, i pulled 50% into cash 2 weeks ago and put like 8% into mid term puts/uvxy calls till it happens. sure my longs will get fucked but ill fap myself to sleep with how much more all these shitters are losing.Be like Bufett. Sit on your cash and wait for the crash or oppertunities.You're not wrong. It's what happened after the dotcom crash. It took years for investors to come back.Im already depressed, trading my ass off this +1 -1 market js killing my accounts staying sideways with the market , Id love a big dropMost of the people who got into stock market long after it rebounded from March just lost a lot of $$$.It already destroyed me. This guy is rightI got into it because Corona-chan left me bored at home with nothing to do all day, I'm sure many others are the sameHappens every time at the top.

PUA ending soonNot sure it's ever going to happen in real terms. Fed can keep the market here for the next 10 years without breaking a sweat. Sure the economy will get destroyed but who cares about that when we can make big gains today."Dad, I'll pay you back.  I covered both legs."This is how it has been through out time. A Fool and his money. 

The Big boys needed somebody to sell to the newcomers did their job!

Of course their is another leg downMajority of millennials don't invest in the stock market. A lot have all these student loans/debt and have little to no money to invest in the market. Soon boomers are going to start retiring and pulling money their money out. With the corona virus some are force to pull some out earlier this isn't too healthy for the market especially with the dying dollar etc.Intel spiked a "volume rate of change" indicator that hasn't hit the same spot since 2015. Then I saw it on a few other equities. Not looking good.buy silver callsBroken clocks are right once a dayI'm an old fag and was in my early 20s during the financial crisis, at that time, I learned how to trade. I made a lot of mistakes, sold V at 60 sold aapl at 100. When you get good deals, let them ride. Also, I never thought I would have opportunities like that again, but look at how many crashes we have had since, flash crashes under Obama, yearly Trump dumps, those are the times you need to load up. You will have another opportunity. For now, I am basically all cash waiting it out, be patient, it will happen.I mean, that’s the nature of things, right? Markets/other people devour the weak and inexperienced, and have for millennia.

But I think there’s a bright side. I think not everyone gets devoured; that is, that out of this free-for-all a few new wolves emerge that weren’t there before.

And old wolves like new wolves: makes the pack stronger and more efficient.

🐺Bears are dead.  If you’re a bear you’re an idiot.  Stocks only go up.  You missed the bottom.  SPY 350 to 400 EOY.That is why there are Professional Investors and everyone else.  The only long term way to out perform is to invest for the long term by buying Index Funds and overweight by buying individual stocks that are creating  the future (NVDA, TSLA, AMZN, etc.)   

The problem for most newbie investors is that simple investing is like watching paint dry.  They would rather believe they are amazing traders that can get in and out doubling their portfolio every week.   

Just like gambling, you must manage your cash to survive the long periods of time when you are wrong.Hey man, speak for yourself. I learned all my pro trading strategies and techniques from TikTokMaking too much sense... the fuck is wrong with you?Pretty accurate.You've just described meso what should we doBull bubbles pay out way more with options. it doesnt really matter if a stock is undervalued, leaps are expensive.Dont forget the "who can I sue for losing money, I was told stonks only go up" step.Don’t you fucking call me out like that god damn it.😂 gay bears unite 🌈🐻

Holy fuck, the stock is down 10x from its highs during the dot-com bubble. If you'd bought in at $200 and held, you'd be down 90% to this day. I mean, as long as you're not FOMOing into $TSLA, you're probably fine.Autism and elitism go hand in hand.Everyone started somewhere. This guy just wants to feel special because he bought the tulips cheaper than the guy after himYou need 10,000 hours of losing your trust fund to be a *real* trader.I mean stocks always go up but not short termDo you know some of my friends?It's only a loss if you sell the car for less than you bought it.Piss on my faceThe news part of the rumor/news trade...That plus second stimulus talks. Yep yep yep.Shoeshine boy, or insider trading. I'm sure it was one of thoseBig if trueI'd like to think people are innately rational, and have learned a thing or two in those 100 some odd intervening years. 

lmao, who am I kiddin?Well most of us missed the bottom and we don't want to wait another 10 years for a buying opportunity. Most (non tech) stocks are still at a discount compared to January so it's hard not to invest, even when another spiral down makes sense logically. 

The fed is straight up backstopping the stock market. They admit it.redistribution of wealth. Taking money from retail investor is like taking candy from a baby...Retail going all in is a contrarian indicator and warrants extra caution. Most of us are all retail so it's a circular hahaSPY $500 Jan 15 2021SPY 11/31 $320/310 put debit spreads probably idkJust don’t brag about being a guru to your pleb friends on your one lucky trade

I made my $10 last week on sweat and tears

Not fucking gamblingalso i was green as Vermont today and just started "trading" in April. I learned to set stop losses and always have a few puts ready for the inevitable. When you say "new" investors, I think what you really mean are 14 year old kids that have been trolling you on the interrnet.Sorry this was my general advise to the new fags as I wish I stuck to the plan.Truly a unique person in WSBsSame thing as you should be doing normally(but which you aren't since you are on r/wsb):
1.Only invest what you can afford to have a very large drawdown.
2. Keep some cash on the side for opportunities.
3. Realise that if the stock market tanks you may be fired and be in for a really shit few years without any cash flow appart from bennies. Prepare as appropriate. Make sure you can put food on the table, that you can pay the mortgage, etc.
4. Understand that if you want to outperform in the next bull market, the next bear market will be the best place to start. The earlier you get in, the better the cost basis and the earlier you get to capital gains tax which is extra CAGR.
The worst part about a stock market crash is that many people are fired, their 401k's get destroyed and they still have to pay mortgages/rent. Especially if you have a family(I don't), you need to understand that shit might be really tough. Talk to any boomer who was 30-40 during 2008( I wasn't), theyll tell you about how tough that shit was.“Inverse WSB” ⬆️⬆️⬆️Yeah I don’t think this is even half of the dropthat’s honestly a better DD.Ignore my other 14 DD postsThen hits you with the "From the person who gave you (insert only winning play here) my next play for your benefit!".You have to be out of your mind if you think these will print. 

1. AMZN has the 4th largest market cap in the world. Companies that have high market caps are much less volatile (aapl, msft, tsla, etc). On average, AMZN sees <0.5% pps fluctuations.
2. At the same time, AMZN's share price needs to increase nearly 17% in 5 days for your contract to expire ITM. This is almost unheard of for a company that has a share price at $3000. Remember TSLA's run up that brought its share price from $1000 -> $1700? This 70% increase took 15 trading days; so on average, it had a price velocity of around 4%+ every consecutive day for this to be possible. AMZN needs to increase its share price by 3.4% on average per day for 3500c to print; thus, it requires that level of hype and optimism that TSLA had and probably even more, since the price of AMZN's share is already high enough and it wouldn't flock in as many retards as it did. Further, a share price increase of at least 3.4% has happened merely 14 times in the past year. 6 of which happened during the corona recovery phase, so I would discount this. So 3% (8/253) percent chance that it'll see 3.4%+ in a day. And therefore, seeing 17% increase in share price within 5 days, is less than 3%.
3. High possibility of AMZN share selloffs post earnings. Remember when TSLA and MSFT beat earnings expectations, and yet its prices still plummeted? Who's to say the same won't happen to AMZN despite their earnings expectations and already inflated prices? Furthermore, do you have any supporting data that their earnings beat isn't priced in?
4. Unlikely, but what happens when there's good vaccine news within the next 5 trading days? AMZN is a COVID stock, so if there's any good news from any of the 100+ biotech firms that are racing to produce the first vaccine, AMZN's stock price will most likely fall.

AMZN needs to overcome so many hurdles for your calls to print, and it has to be one of the most retarded bets I've seen to this date. I would sell it on Monday after all the AMZN weekend hype if I were you.Clearly humans are simply an inferior species and don't know what they are talking about. Ignore all humans, only take advice from geckos, shrimp, or the shitting patterns of dogs.Wait but if I am supposed to inverse you and take advice from everybody, aren’t you included in “everybody”? 

......my brain broke.5K -> 500 -> 1Klol – your title is actually quite correct that this bounce will wipe out many new and non-shrewd investors.

Same thing happened recently in the CAN Cannabis Bubble.Good call it's going to bumpy the next few months as trump takes a hard stance on china and Congress bickers over next coronavirus package.Good call. I went 50/50 as well. Prepare for a volatile market.I’m sorry they’re your friendsDude above you just mad that his incessant Eckhart Magic Toll Bus posts and Secret visualization exercises haven't manifested in his grandma's inherited Schwab account. Or his Tik Tok following. 

He's mad deep though so he'll just go medidate this off in the morning and forget we ever existed, right fuck nugget?The circle of retardsSeems risky. But I’ll nibble...

Edit: wait was that a Call or Put?A gay among gaysDo I count since I grew my account from 5k-26k? I don’t give advice tho, just yolo what WSB tells me too.>Talk to any boomer who was 30-40 during 2008

WHAT

THE

FUCK

I was 25 during the 2008 crash. I'm an elder millennial. Boomers are fucking 70+ now my guy.How do you know when it's the right time to get in nowadays though?

The market is bipolar and only seems to ever have a tiny pullback over a couple of days. How are you meant to time buying a dip? 

It's especially hazardous at a time like this where we're around all time highs and most stocks seem to have miraculously recovered since March.

I'm sitting on 90% cash right now for about 6-8 weeks, and it's absolutely maddening. Hesitating to jump back in because it seems too precarious, but having to watch on the sidelines as people make easy money.

I genuinely don't know what to do anymore, or what to trust.You loss your 401k if you get furloughed?Jesus Christ!!! I just found out I’m a fucking boomer!!! I turned 30 in 2008! Fuck me.Can’t be fired if you never had a job in the first placeDead on. It's a long way down from here.It really isBizarro World TheorySo your saying there’s a chance...

Also LOL at Amazon being a Covid stock. Everything else checks out.I'll stick with bone scrying and crystals.Gordon the Gecko has been M.I.A.  I'm am wondering around the market lost without his psychic guidance.Well, in a way, you doubled your money. So there’s that.If Congress doesn't figure out next package before Aug recess we're fucked. Let alone next few monthsSomeone get that retard some ointment, ouchNot the power bottom we need but the power bottom we deserveWeird flexSimmer down geezer!to a Gen-Z, you might as well be a silent generation...“Boomer” <—— Apparently anyone over 30 ;)Fuck boomers. Some of us were trying to START our careers in 2008. I just made my way to shift lead at Arby's and I'm 38.I mean, 30-40 is too young (gen x truly) but my parents are boomers and they are currently In Their early 60’s late 50’s.Stop trying to time the market. Your experience is normal when you try to time it.  

Buy in with small amounts every week. If it crashes then load up. If it doesnt at least you're not still in cash. Yes lump sum is better 2/3rds of the time but dollar cost averaging can help psychologically. 

Stop trying to pick stocks and buy index funds and hold until you retire. 

Keep a small portion 5-10% for speculation if you enjoy chasing individual stocks. 

It's all easier said then done but this yolo shit is not the real game. It's gambling.90%  cash is a bit much (50% is good). You could try to sell cash secured puts whenever there is a significant pullback (like the -5% drill in June). Understand that you wont buy at the perfect bottom, that kinda thinking is why ppl missed the march selloff.

If you began dollar cost averaging on the way down even from 260 to 220 you'd be up a ton now. After the dip last month financials industrials energy were hit hard (some almost back to march lows). you could sell CSPs to lock in even lower prices or just place limit orders. Don't be guided by fear in investing, otherwise u wont make any money. The only thing you have to fear is fear itself.No, but it tanks like shit. And thats your retirement. When youre a boomer and you have a shitton of money in there, that shit is like an extra member of your family from the people I talked to. Im in Europe, so here the pension plan is much better, but from talking to US people it sucks ass.No, but the value of it will be obliterated. It can come back over time, but that doesn’t help someone who needs the money now (on top of the early withdrawal penalties). Imagine being 2 years from retirement and your nest egg suddenly is cut in half.No. And your 401k doesn’t tank like shit” if you get furloughed. However; if you were furloughed at the precipice of or during a major economic downturn, then your 401k investments will see a downturn based on the broader economy.especially because he didn't give an expiration date. I'd bet someday.. sometime.. amazon will be at 3500. or rolled into a stock that ends up at 3500I think another name for that is 'TA'i don't think you know what a power bottom isboomer = anyone old enough to run for president actuallyLmao extra member of your family, that’s a good oneDo you take money out your 401k to live off of?
I thought your not supposed to touch it until you retireIf you're only 2 years from retirement and your so aggressively invested that your portfolio can get halved that's your first mistake. If your that old, and fully invested in stocks, they should be blue chip dividend aristocrats...Statistically it will recover. Very likely

Ok but you won't have to withdraw from it unless you don't have any rainy day savingsits the flat side of a batteryWell dude let's put it this way. You won't have much choice to take it out or not when you dont have a job and have a family to feed. On top of that, you get slapped with a penalty and some income taxes apparently if you take out money before 60. So taking money out of 401k before your retirement is horrible but thats unfortunately what a lot of people do in a recessionMost people do not have rainy day savings. Nobody says withdrawing early is a good idea, but when you’re jobless with debt and other obligations you don’t have a choice.Nikkei1989-2020.jpg

And remember, mandatory distributions from your IRA!Right. Unfortunately most people don't have savings. Whether it be because of irresponsible financial planning or unforeseen accidents. That sucksI had to cash my 401k out back in 2009 at the height of the crisis because I lost my job. The fees are and taxes took 20 g. Not worth it unless you desperateYeah. So the 401k loss is only a problem for those without savingsIf someone is dumb enough to put thier whole 401k into one stock then they deserve to lose it

I'm sure some companies prevent you from doing this. I know if you work for LA county they only have a limited number of stock selectionsYeah, or those close to retirement.you cant hold your 401k through retirement?

I thought it stays and you withdraw once a month or somethingYou are correct, but need to consider that once retired you’re no longer contributing to its growth, only drawing down on it. So sure, overtime it will recover, but your recovery base will be substantially lower than what it was or could have been.Yeah but stock also go up

So you can't pull out before a crash and put it back in later? How much is the penalty?This is the quality content I subscribed formy wife’s bf just got back from Vegas and he’s coughing a lotWhat do you think Jpow's reaction would be if you could sit him down and make him watch that gif of him printing like a mother fucker?I love you all.

Man knows exactly what he does and whos watching and he has 0 shameHe has to have seen it by now, it's almost impossible that no one has shown him that he's meme famous. If you knew someone who had a meme made about them, wouldn't you want to be the first to show them just to see the reaction?This is actually one of my wildest fantasy: kidnap jpow, tie him on a chair so he can't move, use one of those machines to force his eyes open 24/7, and make him watch that printing gif on an infinite loopI read that as _"sit on him"_

But why?fokken nice broThanks bro. Got out with -40% nbd. I’m learning.Id tell you to get out while you can, but its already too late im afraid. Next you'll be looking up how options work and then you'll start a Robinhood account. By this time you're already fully invested, theres no turning back. You sing the sweet words to put your nerves at ease....

What a fucking genius pioneering financial strategies for the common man“Hard-earned money.” 

 If you *enjoy* your work of fellating businessmen for cash, it’s not really hard work.I wonder if he could lump this into the donation category when doing his taxes.. at this rate, I think soI love the irony of investing your "hard-earned cash" on a company that has yet to make a single fucking dollarAnyone who thinks Nikola is going to be successful in their endeavor in anything less than 15 years, is absolutely-fuxking-nuts. 

Hydrogen doesn't make sense compared to electric. There is too much parasitic loss in the production and storage. 

Short Nikola. 🤷🏼‍♀️This guy is almost too retarded for this sub.Rip this retard, he truly belongs in wsbsomeone point this kid in the direction of /r/investing so he doesn't jump off a bridge in a few months😀🤡🎪🎭🎻This made me cringe as hard as some of the stories coming out of r/polyamory , wouldn't be surprised if there was a crossover in users from that and the $NKLA subreddit.

$NKLA 2x 35p 8/21Shoulda meet Trevor before he did the Ponzi scheme. Would be on the top scamming.Too retarded. WSB is retarded but we have standards here. Being retarded is an artform and requires balance. You cant be 100% retarded all the time.Ok send your wife overI hope they find out about Hyliion in that subOk someone explain to me, HOW THE FUCK, ARE WE THE RETARDS, when I read shit like this?Jesus Christ, they have the discipline to stash away a thousand bucks every single month and they choose to do it on a fucking meme stock, that's just sad.. Dude could probably retire putting that same money on a boring ass ETFStonks only go up?"in different companies"

Then he puts it all in NKLA every monthKoolaide they drinking over there is on another levelThat's great he has no doubt the company will big a huge player and own a lot of the hydrogen infrastructure! Why on earth would one consider doubt when investing in a SPAC with a shady ownership and ongoing social media campaigns to promote the stock?

If stupid people knew they were stupid, they wouldn't be stupid. I'm also amazed Reddit allows that sub to continue to operate.“I have absolutely no doubt” 

L M A O🌈🤡remindme! 5 yearsI think you have to have a product for it to be a ponzi scheme, and they dont have a product... Balls on your court dipshit.All cope posts have this tone.one of us one of usi would call this a failed business, after looking at their company. They need more hype like tesla in order to get pre-orders. It is just sad.In 4 years the only thing Nikola will have produced is mega rich ex executives lolNever go full retardholy fucking run on sentence.  I'm sure he's a good guy and all but if he's not foreign, his improper use of commas reveals him as a complete retard.Nikola is the **BEST** company everrrrrr!  \* holds up spork \*What a dumb cuntshhahahahahaahaGood godThere is no way this will end badly. 

Hope someone tells him to post his loss porn here when he finally gives up on this scam.It s ironic that /WSB judge other group about their gambling addiction....Not very WSB like I sold some OTM puts back in June and NKLA is one which i do NOT want to be assigned as I think its intrinsic value is $0. I hope this stock doesn't Luckin for another month.I mean if you bough at 14, sell that shit when its hyped hotpotato to someone else, even if you still belive in it you will buy again at low when hype pass. But i guess he hates money either way.Worked out for Tesla fans.On one hand people like that make NKLA seem like it’s going to be GTAT all over again and a lot of people are gonna lose a lot of money. On the other hand you people are railing so hard against it that inversing wsb might make sense. Such a hard decisionBut buuut...he’s a happy guyDon’t be shy, post the lossDoes no one every look at the full charts like no DD and you can still see some fuckery going on thereI am still probably down more all time than himI got my Nikola ban today. Fake ass companyThis made my daySo you are retarded?InVeStInGwait, whats the story? the stock skyrocketed and then tanked shortly after. Why?“I’m an investor. I’m not a believer”. We need to have a talk, friend.Oops.Muh hydrogenIs this guy for real?LMFAOWhen anyone post more than 9 words, I just skip to the bottom and try to summarize the idiocy.I mean....it sounds idiotic but if he can do this FOREVER then he'll make a ton of money on it unless NKLA goes bankrupt.  

Then again...if he can invest 1k a month he should just put it in SPY and sleep better.One of us, one of us, one of us.Think how happy he'll be when it gets down to 5$ a share!If that isn't Trevor Milton id be very surprised.Who the hell thinks Nikola will take off? It’s literally a knock off Tesla that doesn’t drive itself and isn’t bulletproof.   Hydrogen? How many hydrogen stations have you seen around? Jesus.Actually but Tsla 12 years ago.  Hell Tsla today. Not that it matters to me, bit this could actually be a green energy story for all those green new deal fanatics. Tsla isn't.Trevor is using his money on only fansI do something similar but with $100 a month into vice stocks. So far so good...Just bought 700 nkla.Is this guy running a stock guru subscription service?A scheme heavily endorsed by Discovery Channels Diesel Brothers as well, sad to see.Of course they're going to let this post be up, I unironically got banned within 5 minutes for posting a picture of their stock price. 

On a serious note, this guy is fucking delusional, it's a Tesla ripoff with 0 products, and only "an ambitious future plan". The only reason Tesla hasn't gone tits up is that, despite the memes, Elon is actually a genius innovator. On top of that, they're the first to market and you can bet your sweet ass that the majority of all the innovative and highly profitable future stuff will have a sweet Tesla patent attached to it. 

Conclusion NKLA is dogshit, and anyone buying into it has definitely been injecting bleach to cure the 'Rona.Is this any better than me working 2 jobs to save up 25 k and blow it up on options?Can’t remember who said it, but Tesla has more vehicles in space than Nikola has on earth.

Not sure why so many people are betting on NKLA to be a big playerWe need people like this to balance things out, ya knowThis poor uneducated kid is drinking the cool-aid hard, like chugging it.I was playing around with the idea of " what if Trevor milton wasnt talking shit? "... then I started to try think about all the possible situations in which they can succeed. He could just not be very clued up on tech, which is why he comes off as a blubbering idiot. But that doesnt mean the people who work there and are designing it dont know what they're doing and they are actually building a legit business which could end up dominating the market. I mean, it did kinda force Elon to speed up the Tesla Truck. If there was nothing to worry about from this company  then they wouldn't feel threatened and want to ramp up their production asap....

Then I sobered up and doubled down on my Tesla positionNah there was the guy who took out a 25k loan at 25% and put it all in Ford.

Edit: It was a 20k loan at 15% but it's still retarded as hell heres the link: https://redd.it/ht0i2f

idk man the XIV margin accounts in 2018 were some big brain stuffI think the guy who went from 100k to 9k on TSLA calls (yesterday?) set the new gold standard for not knowing what IV crush was.This guy is retarded, I made a good chunk of change selling when it crashed from 70 to 58. Sold at 55 and still made 165% instead of 210% but goddamn I'd only be up like 20% right now if I kept it, we all knew it would crash.

How depressing :/You can say that about quite a few companies these days.Yeah but if they switch to making hydrogen bombs their stock will go to the moon!I disagree on hydrogen making less sense than electric. The issue with electric is the batteries and the maintenance cost. 

Say for sake of argument we go down the shittiest efficiency route where its hydrogen combustion engines, the ability to convert electrical energy into hydrogen when the grid has low demand (nights and energy demand stability) and store it in a container, pipeline etc (as well as peoples home heating and natural gas supplies being compatible) far outweighs the advantages of electric and batteries. 

The production cost (and for all the eco warriors out there the demand on resources) of batteries is immense, and their lifespan and disposability are massive issues.

Id bet on hydrogen, just probably not on Nikola.Because you believe this is real.>doesn't always go up 100% daily

>not a stonk

Like he said it's a PONZI SCHEME!! 

Just like the IRS, supermarket, wives, and casions.It’s not gambling if there’s a guaranteed outcome.Hype. It’s a retelling of the Adam Newman story. Down to the stock trades by the executives, in which the company will “borrow out” shares to the executives, that they will in turn sell back to their company at a greater fee.im dying can u link thatHoly shit, we'll all be pressing F to pay respects in a year.Must see.I missed this, thanks for the members’Lol, in a world where gold and silver are running amok, someone borrows money to bet on Ford.

He could've been smart and gotten Airline stocks at the bottom in april and made 30% or bag hold it.

It’s people pre-FOMOing after seeing ads like “do you wish you had gotten into amazon at $3?” To put that much monthly into a company, you should have a complete understanding of their financial statement...Except Nikola has yet to sell anything and their CEO has already taken out $70 million to buy a house and live comfortably. I just wish people would do their own DD and financial research before investing in companies with that much of their net-worth.

Hydrogen is less efficient. Efficiency is king.Gets worse though. Not that it’s a requirement of any sort, but the dude doesn’t even know what a watt is... I don’t know if I would even score high enough tbh, but I figure there should be some sort of exam you need to take before you can start investing your money.

Dont get me wrong Trevor Milton is definitely on the spectrum. I just think we need more testing to determine if he is a functional Autist like myself or has ASSburgersDont get me wrong.

Don't want the majority of my investments locked out until I'm 60.Not anymore. That’s for old-timers and specialty (which requires you to be the 1% of your graduating dental school class).

It’s actually a huge issue now with the corporations like Big Smile (literally its name) dropping salaries to around 150-160k for their ‘most desirable’ jobs in the middle of fucking nowhere. 

If you’re trying to work in an area with a population greater than 10k people, you’re looking at about 120-130k, with tops around 170 if youre in practice with your dad. 

No more money in dentistry.

Laughably, this all started as soon as I was 200k in debt.Your name is Crentist the Dentist?Is that pronounced face-itis? If so, what’s that got to do with the price of eggs sitting in the back of a ponzi-truckCan confirm, gut feelings are bad. Bought 7/31 puts on NKLA on 5 July, after the 6th I didn’t see green until *today*>ads like “do you wish you had gotten into amazon at $3?”

Who puts up ads like this?Not necessarily. If you can store 1kw worth of energy in the form of hydrogen at £0.02p/Kw that will be used to 25% efficiency thats £0.08 per used KW. Thats more efficient than instanteniously requiring 1kw of energy mid day at £0.10/Kw that will be 100% efficient.

P.s. Just used the quoted price per kw figures for easy comparison4 yrs ago Tesla had a product line, a realistic roadmap, and a literal road map. 

I don’t want to be too candid, but at best Nikola has a CEO who has mastered defrauding investors a la Adam Newman. Pulled the sane borrowing shares tactic. Shits gonna tank.AmazingThank you sirWowweee the urban legend becomes a dark reality.Waiting for the loss porn on this one.Imagine paying monthly payments on a loan to get fucked by Ford stocksIt's still almost that exact same price too.

I always thought Dentists were the smart one’s having a lower stress and higher paying job than doctors. I recall the guy who shot the lion being a rich dentist and Chris Rock making a joke that his neighbours a dentist. My presumption was always the field is still very lucrative. Crazy to hear salaries being $120 K.Man I know you are bitter but that’s generally just not true . I work in a town of around 200k and my corporate office is paying me 400-440k a year:)Yahoo finance for one.  Have a look sometime:

Millionaire Investor Alerts: “Get out of Cash Now”"The issue with Hydrogen is the cost to produce it, store it then convert back into electricity. In California 1kg of hydrogen costs around $14 and will get you around 66 miles, which is $0.21 per mile. The California Fuel Cell Partnership estimes prices may drop to $8 per kg which works out at $0.12 per mile.

Currently you can get a gallon of gas for $3.15 in California which at 30mpg it would cost $0.10 per mile. While an electic cars currently costs around $0.02 per mile, which slightly offsets the upfront price premium. A Tesla overall is still going to cost you more than a budget but fuel efficient gasoline car.

The issue for FCV cars is that the fuel cost is higher than Gasoline (when you remove taxes) and the production cost is also higher. They just aren't going to beat gasoline or electric on price. Either way we aren't close to matching the production cost + running cost of gasoline cars. 

The issue is that it's bad for the environment and it won't be around forever, the supply will slowly decrease so we must be prepared to reduce demand or face hyperinflation.Right? Watch it tank to like $5Lol that's even better. What a fucking retard!! He did that shit last week?!?Well no shit, but we’re comparing onlyfans to NKLA.They were absurd a couple years ago. For instance. my uncle who is a dentist (I come from a long lineage of dentists btw lol) made 550k his first year, working 2 days a week, with rudimentary work being done (fillings, cleanings). He graduated with 20k “debt” and paid it off in a month of work. 

When he opened up shop a few years later, he made 2 million a year still only working 2-3 days a week, with a nominal amount of paperwork through insurance etc.

2 years ago a company (Northwest Dental?) bought out his practice for 20 million.

That office is now paying his old employees 180k for what he was previously paying them 300. 

The practice has become as worthless as optometry.Please DM me where you work because I graduated from UWash deep in debt and cannot find a single job through the ADA paying anything more than 190, and that’s literally in the middle of Kentucky. I was scouted through corporate for 160k.

Keep in mind I would rather hang myself than work in Kentucky. 

I need a new job.Ah jeez, that's terrible. edits: thanks for answering though.They both give you images for your money...Damn, thank you very much for sharing this insight. 

I hope it helps out college students/graduates looking into going into Dentistry. Your insight has really opened my eyes and probably will be a valuable information for anyone deciding whether they should take on crazy amount of loans to become one. 

It's really surprising though, aren't dental schools more expensive than med schools usually? Since you guys require same amount of schooling (Not sure what the residency situation is for dentists) i figured the pay of newly graduated dentist would be similar or higher than general practitioner.A fair comparison. NKLA has some dope car porn.Dental schools are infinitely more expensive than medical school. There’s actually an awful joke that says “why is dental school more expensive than medical school? Because in dental school they have to teach you not to pee on your hands” or something to that affect.  Terrible, I know.

I think the *average* debt (which, keep in mind, many of the current years who are in a great deal of debt are also ones from well off families, who actively try to forfeit as much debt as possible), is around half a million dollars for just the dental school alone.

Dental school is to professional schools as English degrees are to 4-years. Everyone wants to do it because it seems easy and you work relatively few days a week, but you have to be born rich to remain financially sound. 

If you want big bucks, go into urology or investment banking. 

Also, for people reading this who are interested in professional school, it’s entirely possible to become anything you want. I swear to god most of the people I am with are actually retarded by every merit, but are able to put in the work and dedication to become what they wanted to become. Too many people see an acceptance rate lower than 20% and think it’s impossible. 

Contact someone on the board for the medical/dental/vet school and say you are interested in their work, or a shadowing of some sort. You’re essentially guaranteed admittance if they can out a face to your application.>but are able to put in the work and dedication to become what they wanted to become. Too many people see an acceptance rate lower than 20% and think it’s impossible.

Thank you! you are a great person for sharing this story and encouraging others try their best. Wish there were more ppl like you on Reddit and funny that I found you on r/wallstreetbets lol.Bro if I could start again I wouldn't be a doctor. At least not internal medicine. Would've picked the investment banker route in the City, suck some dude off and bam, set for life in a firm doing not very much and raking in the big bucks.:’)

Just do your best dude. It’s all you can do.

Wish you luck, and if you need me to look over anything for your future application etc. let me know. I’m bored as hell, hence reddit after 7 years.Same here. I graduated from a pretty good undergraduate university, and all of my friends from my undergraduate have gone on to become investment bankers. All of them are earning like, four or five times my salary after eight years.I keep telling myself that I make a difference, the job satisfaction is worth it. The burnout is telling me OTHERWISE. Its not too late though, I can still get into management...

AFTER downgrades INTC has an average price estimate of $59.55. I'm not an Intel fan, but still... 

INTC 10/16 $50cLol you have no brain indeed

Literally everyone of their analysts got pissed and said fuck them and sell today 😂😂Loaded up. It’s way over sold.If it dips again at the open on monday, im definitely hopping on board. 

Their 7nm product is definitely an issue for the long term, but those products were previously supposed to arrive q4 2021, so in the short term it's still business as usual for intel (outside of the virus issues of course).

Also... intel's 7nm is around the equivalent of TSMC's 5nm. Intel's 10nm is comparable to TSMC's 7nm. Intel just really F'd up because they went too hard on density and it backfired hard on them....

anways... I'm down to hop on the intel comeback for the short term. At least back to the mid 50s during the next quarter, so if it dips im aiming for sept 50cTechnically oversold in the short-term. Picked up a $52 FD next week for $70 near the market close. Probably going to sell it once I get 50% on it.Balls deep in 09/18 $60 and 10/16 $65 calls. Let’s go baby.Balls deep in leaps. This is so oversold. It’ll definitely go up to a nice $60 in the next few monthsWent full retard with $52c 8/7 @$1.32 , 30 contracts.Buying the Intel dip is not a no brainer. The company is in decent financial shape but its long term future is looking bad:

1. They have been struggling for years to transition to the 10 nm tech node and haven’t been able to get decent yields. Now the 7 nm process which was supposed to get them back on track is delayed.
2. AMD is eating their lunch in CPUs. Intel never gained any ground against NVDA in the GPU market. 
3. Their acquisitions to get a foothold in other industries have been dissapointing. (Mobileye)
4. They have a poor reputation among engineers and are bleeding talent. Anyone who can is looking to leave. The people who stay at Intel are the ones who can’t get another job.

The tech industry moves fast and today’s winners can disappear if they lose their edge. Look at what happened to Yahoo. Sun Microsystems. Silicon Graphics. All the office parks in the Valley have hidden histories to tell about the companies that used to do groundbreaking work there.I've got 7/31 $60c and 8/7 $60c.07/31 55c was like 19 dollars kekIntel hits 60 next week after AMD earnings suck. 
Positions: 17 INTC 9/18 60CYou don’t think Intels goin sideways with Apple ditching them this year?Bought 30 contracts when it was about $49.80.  Did ITM calls, 8/21 47.50c for only $3.50 which seemed ridiculously low.  Happy with it unless QQQ drops another 2% Monday.Intel is oversold but there is no indication of buybacks in any of my TA charts.  IMHO Intel might drop more on Monday.  I'm gonna wait and see what happens Monday morning before making any decisions, it might not start going up until mid of next week.

EDIT: since earnings report were yesterday, it's most likely going to go down for a few days in a row.Jacked to the tits on 10/16 52.50c.(sell puts)Hell ya balls deep in intel calls let’s get this easy bread.This is some Gordon Gecko level day trading in clarity, conviction, and "don't give 2 fucks".

https://www.cpubenchmark.net/high_end_cpus.htmlI said the same thing when it was -10% AH, woke up to a -15%....Same here! Picked up the 52.5 Oct calls thinking this is a huge overreaction. didnt quite get the bottom for the day but still happy with it.only put a few k in it, if it dips any further monday I will double down and keep doubling down every dip until im filthy richFI have similar thoughts about MRNA this week (although I acknowledge that they are an un-established company unlike AMD), but everyone hates them in this sub so I don't think anyone will listen. Despite that their phase 1 data represented a near-perfect outcome. I've also seen and analyst an an IP attorney point out that the recent patent news has little to no immediate impact on MRNA and may not ever.I'm looking for the autistic madman who YOLO'ed into 7/31 INTC 53p and was up over 3000% today. I hope he sold and dumped the money into calls for 2 weeks out to at least get the dead cat bounce on Monday.I thought the same, cancelled at last second. Been burned by intel before, only ever seen it drop in a hurry never go at as quick... good luck though, hope gravy soaked tendie glory is yours!it actually blows my mind how some people r saying January calls will not printwatch the market begins its rollover next week... buy the dip until you cantimo intel can recover they have the history and the infrastructure. in the long run your basically betting on them getting their heads out of their asses and sorting themselves out. right now theyre on the back foot though, notice amd is going hard on the ads and youtube marketing, if it works intel stands to lose.Tuesday 7/28 AMD will report a profit so I can see Intel trading at $49-$50 for the entire week.

Makes no sense entering this week. 

After AMD earnings I will go for INTC sept-oct 55C. First week of August there's also a $0.33 dividend.I dont see intel going back up. Not with their 10mn and 7mn being hot garbage.post losses on fridayIt better go up in the beginning of the week, if it doesnt I'm yolo'ing your wifes unemployment checkIntel will go down longer, poor guidance and product roadmap has been set for AMD to take the momentZen 4 ( should be tsmc 5nm ) timeline is next year, intel pushed out their 7nm to late 2022/early 2023. AMD gets a whole year of process advantage to gobble up market share (assuming intel gets its shit together or outsources)

If AMD fucks up Zen 4 it will have equal performance to Intel 10nm (tsmc 5nm is \~80% denser than intel's 10nm \~ 15% free performance gain)

Intel isn't sure they can catch up to TSMC and retake process advantage. So the nuclear option is outsourcing (TSMC)

End of the day AMD still risky cause intel will just switch to the same process and kick their ass with better design but TSMC gets to eat their tendies

Meanwhile Samsung is trying to compete with tsmc with 3nm GAAfet

I'd buy intel under $50Bought Intel calls today for hella cheap near the bottom. I wanted to go balls to the wall but learned my lesson from NKLA lolwalt being refrosted is probableI’m balls in on 01/22 $60 bought 500 at 3.90 lolBut only one ball, I put the other ball into NIOThe chip delay for 7nm would mean they’re competing with 5nm AMD.... it’s a disaster for INTCI must have timed it well bc I'm up 10% on the calls I bought an hour before closeThe analysts downgrade so they can buy cheap. They did this with Sony all the way to $40. They filled their bags and now it’s at $80. Guarantee big money bought at $50 todaySounds bullish to meThis. Exact same move just 6 months ago or 10 months ago. Blah blah down, big funds pump in for that div and then back to where it was.Bruh should have bought closer to the money IMO.For Intel? Why ? I want to fully understandIdk about amd earnings sucking. They released the ryzen laptop processors earlier which are so much better than Intel laptops in performance and power consumptionAmd processors were sold out so many times this quarantine even i bought one. The price to performance is so much better than intel so i think they beat earningsLol ok.exactly.Remind me! 72 hourscool. boomers will keep buying those dell laptops and intel will go back to $60 easy.Yes sirrrrI mean fuck it. I missed on $FE the other day and wanted a high risk, in and out play. otherwise I'd keep dumping money into Wal-Mart waiting for them to launch wmt+that's ok. IV is only 30%. IV on gold is higher than that. just need kang gang to hop around a bit and the calls will printDid you just compare Intel to NKLAIf it helps Intel actually sells a real productProbable=Priced inI will cash out before electionAMD is going to slowly insert the whole shaft into Intel over the next 3 yearsWhen you say "disaster" are you referring to their increased year over year sales or their expectation beating profits?  Again, I don't have a hard on for Intel, I'm just betting they bump next week with that sweet JPow pump.10% on calls is barely a mark to market in optionsRemindMe! 4 daysAlright hope you get that dead cat bounce. I’d bail after it. It’ll be short sellers taking profit mainlyThursday's close was $1.96 and I bought them for $.07. Just gambling.I bought a laptop with one and had to wait 2.5 months. Meanwhile the same model was put up by the seller with an intel processor of the same range and it never even went on backorder. Might speak to $AMD supply chain ... probably speaks to $INTC consumer sentiment. 

In my opinion $INTC brand dominance is going down faster than IV crush on whatever options are being peddled here.LET ME DREAM DAMMITYou and I, and many others who have grown up on the internet know this. Let’s goooooI was saying that I wanted to buy more calls for intel but learned to not go all in from playing with NKLA lolI guess my comment was confusing lol I was saying that I bought calls for Intel and wanted to buy more but I learned my lesson about going all in from trading NKLA. I bought hella puts and they all expired cuz I timed the EFFECT wrong lolPerhaps, I’m hoping at least a double, I think it will be a quick bounce to 60Nope. With Nvidia buying ARM the entire market is going to go away from X86. Both INTC and AMD are shafted in the long run. In the short run INTC will bounce back to 55 soon.I’m talking about fucking up 10nm and losing dd mkt share to AMD and now fucking up 7nm which calls into question them earning anything over $5/share from 2020-2023.  All about the future fuck this past quarteractually 10% means I have 10% more money than I had before my genius maneuverDead cat? You act like Intel is shutting their doors. They are still a major player in the chip industry and will be for the foreseeable future.oh pat. you're better than this.Oh great DD. How many Wirecard shares do you have?However, microcenter has amd in stock rn and so does Amazon. Amd laptops are that much better, I doubt amd knew how hard they'd sell themWow they do a lot more fucking than me....  I don't think I bought enough calls.Fuck that math checks outI’m sorry I didn’t know this was r/investing I thought this was wsb a one / two week options gambling sub ....Did you read the results ? They pushed a key product. Gonna lose market share daily to amd. And went backwards on margins. They missed on all important metrics. Good luckIn reference to your Amazon statement, here's some more info for you to digest: so when i paid for my laptop I paid about $1300. In order to get the same laptop on amazon (a month and a half later, still before my order was fullfilled) I had to settle for a cheaper GPU, less RAM and smaller battery/SSD if I wanted the same price. In order to get the same laptop it was around $1600. 

I ordered my laptop right after the ryzen 7 cpu drop, seems like they had to raise the prices on that processor line significantly in order to slow down demand.let me know what strike/expiry you want, I'll write them for youOnly if he really put all his money in intel calls, he more likely has 110% of the money he invested in intel calls not 10% more money totalIf you’re gonna’ toss around predictions expect a response in return. This is wsb, a gambling sub where you will get called out and memed at.Most of of us are looking to fuck and make profits...dont think anyone is looking to fall in love with intc and start a familyRSI was probably under 20 on any cadence you look at after that dump. way oversold and somehow the IV on my sept calls was in the 30% range. not sure what metrics you use, but that's a trigger for me. im also not some shit nugget 20yr old yoloing their student loan money.been playing long enough to know that's an overreaction. no reason to think it doesn't jump back up yo low-mid $50's next week and turn my 15% OTM into a nice paydayJan 2022 $10 calls, won’t go over $5 per option. Take it or leave it.My prediction is a dead cat bounce aka it gets back maybe 5-7% next week and then starts a quarter long pullbackLet’s see if the Greeks favor your 15% out next week ...>RSI was probably under 20 on any cadence you look at after that dump.

Close.....25.I know what a dead cat* bounce is and I don’t agree with your prediction. You honestly see INTC dumping into the 30’s from here? Seems unlikely to me, but hey, grab some put spreads if you’d like.I meant to type under 30 which is the markI think it’ll hold $40 but do see it headed thereI guess we’ll see. 

RemindMe! 2 months10k in 24 hours using an app on your phone. Fuck yeah.Big dick power moveBought at close yesterday $60 7/24 for a grand.Good shit bro. Enjoy the gainsLiquidated prematurely, I’m guessing.

I'm sitting on -3700% on some 60CsRide this Su-Su train into the sunsetNice.How did you end up making this play? What was your thought process?Congrats and fuck youWhat is a call?This is the epitome of capitalism right here.Sold at open but I am fomoing rn. Could be over 2000% rn$62 7/24 could have gotten you 100 contracts for a grand. But you would have sold at open for $23,000 like me, instead of later getting $76,000. Except you weren't retarded like me when I forgot to buy calls at close yesterday.Dang I should have fomoed100% should have done this. Literally was wondering if I should close half day or at open. Could have been bothIf I saw 1,000% gains on my phone I'd liquidate prematurely too...The expiry is todayTheres still some gas. But the bulk of the move is done. Now its just pure gambling. Id go for shares and sell puts on this bad boyDefinitelyThank you for your serviceThank you for your serviceWhat made you buy amd calls?Profit is always good now you can FOMO over something else.You never go broke taking a profit brothaWouldn’t beat yourself up too much. I sold 1/2 of a GLW call position that went up by a similar proportion a couple weeks ago. Then GLW bled for another couple weeks. Bottom line, if I had liquidated my whole position early, my average selling price would’ve been higher than what I ended up selling the calls for. GLW did run eventually, but said run started on the day my calls expired and I only held 5% of my original position to that day.I’m guilty of it as well. But learning to exit progressively is key to getting the most out of your good trades. You’re up 10x - yeah that’s an amazing profit - but if the price movement isn’t giving you a reason to sell there’s no reason it can’t go for more. Plus by then you’re usually deep ITM so theta won’t fuck you and you can hedge pretty cheaplyYou think you would, but greed over powers youFelt good buying back options up 1800%Happy to help haha, enjoy the tendies!AMD broke out of its consolidation channel this week. Bullish pent up energy. When she moves, she moves for days. Expected NVDA speculation money to flow into AMD now that NVDA is too high. Pop hard Wednesday on New product news and it took a market to push her down Thursday. Bullish energy still there for ER next week. Expected a 5% bounce today. Intel did me good unexpectedly. 

AMD was the meme stock of 2017-2018 before Tesla.That was an ejaculation joke, lolGuess I haven't really been paying attention to amd lately since its been relatively flat the past couple months. Congrats on your winningsYou think I should buy in? Or did I miss the train?How long are you expecting this to last? What position should I take to  capitalize on this run?Ah yes the su bae. I wish I bought it at 3 bucks fucking easy clap.The way you feel during and after either is disturbingly similarIf its flat when the entire tech and semi market is moving up bigly, its a huge signal. Three months of flatness on a meme stock means a large move up or down, it needs a huge event to break out. All the conditions were lining up for these kind of bullish bet.Theres still some gas. But the bulk of the move is done. Now its just pure gambling. Id go for shares and sell puts on this bad boyThis MF acting like some genius.  It's easy to sound smart after the winning tradeThat's exactly how I scored big on apple broCheck my wsb post history for major loss porn. NSFWNot a genius. Just telling my strategy and intuition. It could have done a big move down and I would lose a grand. I took the gamble. Winning big and losing big on FDs is my thing. Peep the flair.He’s not wrong. I wanted into this trade for exactly the same reasons he mentioned but I’m a bitch who doesn’t trust his instincts. AMD had been chilling for months in the same range while the rest of tech fucking mooned.

The move up Wednesday was the signal to get in. Despite everyone here saying that it’s dumb to buy calls after an 8% day, momentum is a thing that exists and breakouts are real. New highs beget new highs. All the signs were there but Thursday shook a lot of people out (including me)U rightNSFW is how I like it. Currently jacking off to your losses in my cubicle.If you knew it was going to make a big move but didn't know which way you could've straddled.What's your next play so I can yolo and have an excuse to get out of this hellscape.Classic, burning their own fields for the insurance moneyYou need to inverse all suggestions on WSB, then you will make moneyWhy would you have stop losses for stocks? Stocks have no expiration, stonks only go upOddly satisfying.This is me except Id lose control and drive into the fire.This made me kind of sad. Hope he's insured.ACBI miss the days when this sub was good Best descriptor ever possiblyPlaying it awful close too, like hedging your portfolio with one vxx call. Can I buy insurance on my portfolio of only options on triple levered ETFs?He's making a fire break you tardMore like, you general should be selling premium and not buying it even if you agree with the sentiment.  All those people who thought TSLA were going to beat earning and got IV crushed would have been fine if they were selling deep OTM call spreads or if they sold put spreads instead.Haven’t we figured out already that with every trade decision you slip into an alternate timeline where you lose money?What I find interesting is WSB is usually right on a lot of things at least in the near term. Its the fact we exit our positions at the most retarded time physically possible.So then, don't inverse?Once I saw a stock that went down. I logged out for 24 hours and there it went pumping again.Because if it's dropping and triggers the loss you can generally buy back cheaper and you will not have lost the full value that you accrued.Sure can.  TopPackage LLC is a well known insurance provider of esoteric risk.

We're also self insured, so there's zero risk of counter party default.If you're trading a stock powered by 95% hype then you act like real earnings are gonna effect it... Then you're gonna have a bad time.Had a reverse calendar on it and made out ok but probably would have done better with that strategy. Wasn't sure which way it was going to break.The nice thing about selling premium is that it's usually the exact opposite.  These super-meme stocks generally have insane IV.You wanna know... why i use optionsBetween this and the dude swallowing a goddamn banana like he owes Chiquita money, this place continues to prove more valuable than a Fed TALF announcement.Tesla infinity squeeze is still coming though right guys? Guys?

They have to restart the infinity squeeze.Fuck reading that retards posts really fucked me up on taking advantage of the V recovery.Honestly it would have squeezed but CNBC told everyone not to buy after the massive earning beat. All the boomers just do what the tv says, and all the autist got to sell to pay rent on FridayHas to be, it had gold awards! Those never go tits up. Just like the tanker DD a while back.guys?Yeah like that guy that said coca cola was making a weed drink it can't go tits up[removed]This is hilariousAffirmations on pointthey're paying 6 bucks for me to trade a one dollar profit lmao. im a dollar menu swing traderIntroduce a little autism and everything becomes...chaos.I think this sub is generally quite funny but tossing around autism like a slur is weak. Particularly when autistic people likely do a lot better on the stock market than the clowns of wsbHonestly cracks me up the amount of fuckery that happens here- win or lose money this sub is more entertaining than most other places on the internet.

Also mad props to chimpu!Reddit’s best sub by farWe have to be, the other option is to become depressed and get some $ROPE.humor is the only cure for depressionOnly thing funnier are the dickheads on CNBCI have no idea what most anyone in the sub is talking about, but by god does this sub have some of the memes and gifs.Lead, eventually.Im kinda out of the loop on this one, who is it?

But if you are serious it is Charles Schwab's account value and positions screen.  I've posted all my positions pretty much as they happen if you want to go through my comment/post history.Lol bruh sameSoon son I just need to hit up Wawa for a hoagie and some swishers.Short term I dont think we will keep running 18% a day. We may pop but I doubt anything too big at earnings. If anything I think we sell off a bit.  But long term I can easily see AMD getting up to 120-150B in market cap with in a year or two.  Maybe even sooner with how hyped everything gets in this market.He is! He said we can go get some ice cream later and I can have extra sprinkles.The 70 and 75 Jan 21s  are a debit spread that I'll close together closer to expiration or at expectation depending if we are sitting above 75. The 2022 leaps I'll be holding for at least a year to get the tax advantages and sell diagonal spreads to try and stay theta positive on them.Hedge your bets. Historically AMD has fallen immediately after earnings, then risen later. We might run some more but I think the move has been made until we see Milan, Zen 3, and RDNA 2.Haha I am glad you noticed that. Believe it or not that was not intentional.You bangin’ that crip cuzzzThey deliver now! COME HOMeI’m thinking  74 7/31c is that too otm?Well... sprinkles are for winners!Oh ic bc your shares can't possibly cover 500 contracts. Nice discipline, sticking to the ticker you know.Bruh I got 100 bucks to shove at a put is there any way 60p 7/31 makes moneyI am aware that could happen. but AMD is gonna report earnings on tuesday.

Is gonna go up on monday or be stable? 

I wanted to make a call with 15% margin and selling before the market closes for some quick bucks.Yeah I would need 50,000 shares to cover that haha. Also thanks, I found it best to just focus on a few tickers and really get a feel for how it moves and reacts to news.Subae moves in mysterious ways....But seriously I have no clue what's going to happen on any given day.

Almost new record.  

Riding gold miners, silver miners and SPY put spreads.  Sure, miners will dump with everything else, but I can't time shit.  The miners are all for Jan 2022, so they will drop and then hit all time highs again within three months.  Also, gonna get me some of that sweet sweet long term capital gains.

I'll use the SPY put spread to double or triple my positions at the bottom.Oh my **fucking** god this happened last week too, I completely forgot what day it was.

It *is* fucking Friday, are you fucking kidding me?!?!?!?!

I BOUGHT THE BYND DIP.... FUCK!Bear gang needs to die.Go upstairs asap. Bears don't know how to go up.If it's a black bear, open the Robinhood app and buy as many puts as you can and pray that they print. 

If it's a grizzly, you r fuk. Do as you please on your last seconds.Still enough for 1 last YOLO!

Edit: yolo on $WORK  Jul31 40CCheer up. You got that 5G e.I like this.Can you tell me your next position so I can inverse?Go buy an August Enph 65 call. You’ll print like JPOWYolo all on Intel callsBetter pray work closes above 40That’s literally mine. My losses however are 4xLike a bolt from ZeusI chose a bad week to quit sniffing glue.Damn and I'm sitting here anxious about my WORK 32c 9/18“It’s all red”

“Always has been”Man you really hate greenSmallstreetbets 👉JesusJust flip it upside down. Problem solvedDown but not out. Use that 1k on AMD callsTurn it upside down itll make you feel better, oh wait nevermindLooks like mine, before I swapped to Theta Gang. Nothing but gains nowI love that baskets of OTM FDs are considered portfolios here>if WORK closes below $40 your option expires worthless

...they just rubbing it in now"portfolio"This isn't even badI don't know how I feel about you. I love you for your courage and want to kill you at the same time for not able to green a single time. Study up.Lol work6k for a year? Shit I lost 8k in 2 months lmaoThat's a fucking consistancy, can you please from now post your positions so we can inverse them?Yolo INTC or AAPL callsYour not done yetYOLO Intel 2/19 60c @1.92I'll sell you that call.

Edit. Nvmd already selling $35c :)Just closed my robinhood after staring at my $WORK Aug21 $34 to see this. Not inspiring confidence..RemindMe! 3 hoursWhy august? Haven’t kept up with themIt’s under 30 lolProbably should be lolWas gonna downvote because 7,000 is plenty to be able to post a loss on this sub (2,500 is minimum) but didn’t bec of your username lolEarnings. You will not be disappointedI do have earnings to potentially save me, or bury meI’m ElonOh boy that’s tempting. NKLA puts finally went green so I sold before they had time to fuck me again. Sounds like a great Monday YOLO, I know they’ve been doing good but this market is fucked nowadasI mean never have had positive earnings always have beaten estimate a bit but idk think theta will fuck you before that pays off hard to say thoWhat's funny is this is the best way to stay undercover here, no one would believe Elon would be this retarded.I can almost guarantee you’ll be back at 7k with those calls. Earnings will be great, and they’ll go up 50% like what happened in MayProbably. Odds are definitely stacked against me. I'm just hoping it breaks 31 again in the next couple weeks so I can sell off a few of the contracts. Hopefully new stimulus ends up helping me instead of fucking me> no one would believe Elon would be this retarded

are you sure?Hmm how sure are you of this play!?Way too sure. 85-90%Too late to get in on Monday ? Fuck it might gamble me 500 buckaroniesNo perfect time. Only issue is that Iv is creeping up so watch for thatThis is so autistic I had to call my wife's boyfriend so he can see it for himself

He smiled and it made me happyYou’re not right, but you’re not wrongThis is probably the most retarded thing I’ve ever seen on this sub RedditAre you accepting new clients?What if IV collapses? Then both your puts and calls are screwed.Damn you can talk shit to the bulls on a red day and do the same for the fags on a green day. Shit why didn't I think of doing autistic long and short strangle that's not delta neutral.Truly you belong hereActually not a bad way to play. I might start doing this. Seriously. But I would weight the outcome to be something like 75% calls and 25% puts since, in general, the markets move up. There are probably some nerds out there who use a Markov chain for this shit. But DD ain't my thingWSB never fails meOctopus Gang Has Risen Again!!!

Look at your watch, if the second hand is between 0-30 buy calls, if it’s between 30-60 buy puts, and then next time if it’s 0-30 you sell, if it’s 30-60 you hold.I’ve been using this same strategy. It’s going well.I did that yesterday and made $8,000 in about four hours.

Should have held through today though, would have been another $5k gains.It’s so retarded...

On 2 or 3 of them buy puts, calls on the rest. Then sell each at a profit sometime before expiry, or it expires worthless.  Once you've recovered your initial investment you start again with 8 new positions. If all of your positions expire worthless, you lose.

I'm gonna call it SPY Roulette.The best way to do this is to just use a random number generator. Many of the built-in ones require a seed number and you use the system time on your computer as the seed number and it turns out this is pretty good for giving random distributions.Free fucking money gangIdk I haven't got that far.

[https://ibb.co/Lhhx9S2](https://ibb.co/Lhhx9S2)

I'm 30 years old, $70k/year pretty stable job. Goal is long-term, slow and steady growth. I have zero debt besides my new mortgage. I hope to retire by 65 at the latest. I am just closing on my first house and potentially getting married soon (and she has a 1 year old) so I want to keep at least $15k in emergency cash. "Liquid assets" to me means my checking + savings + Fidelity investment accounts (Not my 401k or physical assets).

I currently only have $15k in my Fidelity investment account, and of that, only $8k already in the market. I know you're not supposed to time the market, so I'm trying to dollar-cost average my way in cautiously. I want to invest heavily in higher-risk, higher-reward equities, while still hedging against market downturns with bonds/gold/silver, and potentially crypto (Although crypto seems to just follow the stock market). My strategy will be a long-term buy-and-hold, using ETF's only to further diversify.

Any thoughts or advice is greatly appreciated.What differentiates two index ETF's like VOO or SPY?

Thank you very much for your help!Does anyone know of any investing courses, preferably online (inc. free and paid)?

I have seen a number of online courses such as Phil Town's "Rule One Investing", however, I quite frankly don't trust these for whatever reason.

If you have any information please let me know.What are the pros and cons of having an investment company handle your investments? Do you have to actively tell them what to do or can you just tell them your goals and they handle the rest? I clearly have no idea how to invest.On my bank's website They have a section where you can create "wishlists" of stocks, options, etc.  It's pretty cool, and fun to just add things to the wishlist to see how they would do if I actually invested.  My question is on options.

Lets focus on Tesla since it's super popular and volatile right now.  On the option chain, it lists a 1400 strike price at 104.30/106.00 Bid/Ask.  This is Aug 21 expiration.  So if I were to buy 1 contract of that, how would I figure my premium?  Would it be 104.30 per contract?  Thanks.

P.S. I'm not actually gonna do this, it's just for my curiosityHello I am 25 years old and a treasury accountant in Canada. I am really considering changing careers, but I have already spent last 7 years of my life going to school and working as an accountant. 

I have a paid off 06 civic and no debt and am able to save around 2300 a month. I put most of that away in my tfsa and stock account. I have lost most of my money earned in the last couple years due to shitty stock choices and options. I currently have 10 k wrapped up in tgiff and shrm both of which have absolutely plummeted. 

I am two months into my job making 55k a year. I have around 11 k in my tfsa and went from 50k to 12k with my stock account in last two years. 
I would be able to get an interest free loan from my mom if needed. Was thinking she could help me max out my tfsa ASAP and I slowly pay her back over time. 

My rebuild plan for my portfolio is going to be mostly mid cap stocks buying when they drop and setting limits to sell for gains/losses. My tfsa is all index funds and won’t be touched for a very long time. And the rest will be in options just to have something to look at.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

ThanksHey everyone, I've been using the Moneybox app this year and it's sparked my interest in investing. I'm ready to take things to the next level so I decided to move to a new platform (I feel Hargreaves is a good fit)

(I'm 26, making medium/high income on my own business with no debt. Looking for a more financially secure future)Hi there!   
 I have a 401(k) on Transamerica through work (invested in several index funds).  
I'm looking to also invest discretionary funds (probably in additional index funds). I'm wondering if I should do so through Transamerica (already having a 401(k)) account with them, or if it's worth opening an account with Vanguard (which I see is highly recommended here). I can't tell how much the actual platform matters (as I can invest in Vanguard Index funds either way). Thoughts?I am considering adding a position in Mutiny Fund ([https://mutinyfund.com/](https://mutinyfund.com/)) to my portfolio for risk protection.  Does anyone have perspective on this fund specifically?

I'm 40, employed, dual income no kids household ($350k yearly income), low risk tolerance, current plan is to increase equities holdings and therefore add mutiny as downside protection.  Time horizon is 5 years, not short term.31 y/o, 71k salary, targeting late winter early spring 2021 to buy a house, 40k in stocks (61%)/ 11k in bonds (17%)/ 16k in reserves (22%). Only debt is my car loan: 20k left, $517 monthly. Based on what I am able to put away each month, employee stock vesting, and bonus, I'm projecting I'll have 75k-80k by the time I'm ready to buy, planning on holding on to 10k for emergency. I have 10k in my Roth but it <5 years old so I cant borrow for the house yet.
  
Question: I expect the consensus will be that I need to start re-allocating from my stock holdings to my bond/reserve holdings to limit my volatility and I wanted to know what kind of schedule I should follow. Sell off stocks monthly/bi-weekly/bi-monthly? Should I still target to keep a percentage of my holdings in stocks?Hi All,

I have following pending debts:

* Primary Home - $410K (3% APR) - 25 years more
* 2 Cars - 15K (0.9% APR) - 18 months more
* Home Loan (home country, 8% APR, 20 years more) - $140K (no rent as of now, but expecting early next year, close to $600/month)

I have following savings (not much):

* Emergency fund - $40K
* 401K - $200K

I am going to receive good sum of money ($250 k post tax lump sum) which I want to put to use in a better way so that I can invest as well as clear some debts. I don't want to risk all of that in investment as well as not use all of it for clearing debts. It feels like a good opportunity to make good short term profits if investing amount is more (compared to monthly investment of $500/$1000 long term) but I don't have knowledge about stocks.

I am employed in my late 30's with 2 kids. I make around 175 K and my wife is home maker.

Looking for thoughts on where to expand as well as other investments with the hopes of cashing out with moderate gains in 7-10 years.

Hey,

I'm trying to save up for a house down payment. The problem is-- I don't know when I want to buy the house. It could be 3 years, it could be 8. There's not a point where I would be \*forced\* to buy a house at any particular time, but I live in DC; if I stay here, the price of housing is high and growing higher each year, which would push me to buy earlier. But I may leave the area, hence my level of uncertainty.

I have about 60k saved up for a down payment so far (in addition to my emergency fund etc). Would it make more sense for me to keep this cash in a HYSA, or in a Vanguard account w/ short + ultra short term bonds (maybe 80%) and around 15% large-cap equities? Or is there a third option I'm not thinking about?If you buy a bond at a discount, say $1000 bond at 90, do you receive the full face value when it matures, plus any interest that was remaining at the time you bought it? If that's the case why would you ever buy a bond at a premium above face value?Hi all,

I’m in my last year of college and getting serious about investing. I’ve been building my investing account to around $18k over the past 5 years. I also have an acorns account with $1.5k in it that’s up like $76 in 3 years. My questions is; would it be dumb to move the money from acorns into my main account so I can try to get better returns and better control over what the money is invested in?###Wash sale

The entirety of my non-retirement investments is in ESPP, which I typically wait to become long-term, and sell when prices seem favorable.

Company stock has been hammered pretty hard in the past year. I recently sold some long-term lots that I intend to invest elsewhere rather than hoping the stock recovers in the near future. However, the most recent ESPP purchase also happened earlier around the start of this month, apparently causing the sale to be a wash.

So how bad is any of this? I'm barely aware of the difference between long- and short-term holding. I do see that there is unrealized loss from the sold lots now applied to the most recently purchased lot, and its holding period is considered "fractured" instead of "short-term". **Futures trading and risk management on a low budget, how you do it?** 

 

budget&strategy:

\- \~2000€

\- \~ slow frequency trend following type of thing (average trade duration \~6 weeks)

\- lots of markts (metals, agriculture, commodities, stocks, forex, indices etc

\- risk max \~2% of capital (2000) per trade

current situation:

iam trading on a 100% cfd platform. i can manage my risk very well there and have a lot of open positions (40 currently, well at least for me this is a lot) because i can open positions in every instrument with as little as 30€

what i want:

but i really want to switch to a futures oriented platform, why? i dont konw exacltly, mostly to try it out i guess. get a feel for it. currently i pay overnight fee's and some other fee's, but overall it is less than 100€ per 100 trades. i wanna see how fee's turn out on a futures based exchange (longer holding without overnight fee's might be worth it?).

to the core issue:

But i had a phone call today with someone from ninjatrader and i asked her a lot of questions mostly about the margin shown on this chart:  
[https://ninjatrader.com/PDF/ninjatrader\_futures\_commissions.pdf](https://ninjatrader.com/PDF/ninjatrader_futures_commissions.pdf)

i asked her very specific questions and as it turns out i cant trade there like iam currently trading (2% risk, lots of open positions) with only 2000€ (well, not even with 5k or 10k for that matter).

why? one example:

to buy one coffee contract (last page ICE Exchange KC), she explained, my available balance would shrink by the amount seen in the MARGIN Intraday column, which in this case would be 1000usd.

but how does this make sense? one coffee contract on the ICE exchange costs only \~120USD as you can see here: [https://www.theice.com/products/15/Coffee-C-Futures/data?marketId=5602925](https://www.theice.com/products/15/Coffee-C-Futures/data?marketId=5602925)

so how canti just buy one contract and my available balance would shrink by the amount one contract costs?

also, i heard i can apply leverage to typical futures instruments. shouldnt i be able to apply a 1:6 leverage lets say and buy one contract for \~30USD here? is this common practice?

was she wrong when explaining the margin or where is my misunderstanding?23 year old, medium to high risk tolerance portfolio help to compliment future 401k

Okay keeping this short and simple, I got my account to roughly ~26k on robinhood trading option spreads but got burned pretty bad and down to 22k. Learned my lesson and I still have high risk tolerance because this won’t be my main retirement planning account but a growth account. Looking for advice for a balanced but risky port. I plan on putting 10-15% of yearly earnings into a 401k with 4% match so not worried about that much. I studied finance and data analytics in college so some knowledge but only have moderate experience. Most of my knowledge is in tech companies. Done with options, but open to covered calls. Any advice is welcome.

Other things can happen though - your house/apartment could burn down, could get robbed, etc.  And if you do get notice of losing your job, it could take more than 3 months to find a new one.I dont know what medical expenses are like in Germany but in the US a lot of that emergency fund is to cover the risk of medical bills since medical care is so expensive in the US. I live both in the US and Spain and I know that in Spain medical expenses are something we don't have to worry about at all since it is all completely free. So if it is similar in Germany then I would say you need less of an emergency fund. Maybe lean more towards 3 months rather than 6 months.If short term, you shouldn't be in stocks anyway.  If long term, you shouldn't care that today is in the red, it's meaningless.Robinhood lets you invest however many dollars you want and you get a percentage of stock. Can even buy like 22.44 stocks. Highly suggest doing this and I wish more people were aware of this. It lets you buy even Tesla without having to buy 1 expensive stock. I think its a great way for those who don't make as much to start investing.

Although you won't be able to place orders like stop losses, its good to throw a few bucks and hold long term.Assuming they’re all in tax advantaged accounts, no, not that I can really think of, mine are already in that set up and the general recommendation is to use TDFs or a 3 fund anyways 

Deciding between the 3 fund vs TDF is based on your target allocation, if you’re happy with what’s offered in the TDF then it’s fine to use that, otherwise you can DIY with the 3 fund 

You’d want to look at the available funds in any 401k or equivalent employer plan to make sure you’re picking the lower ER option between TDF vs 3 fund, or for example if you really only have a low ER option of an SP500 fund, you’d want to be weighted toward small/mid caps, international stocks, and bonds (if you’re including them in your portfolio) in your other accounts so that the allocation across all of your across matches what you’re targeting, rather than just focusing on it within each account (if that’s not an issue then it’s straightforward to do similar allocations in each account)Start out with VT. It is an index of the global stock market.

For what it’s worth, this is timing the market. If you believe “time in market > timing the market” you should invest all your cash immediately into your desired asset allocation, not DCA. https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Dollar_cost_averaging#Dollar_cost_averaging_versus_lump_sum

Going QQQ is betting that the insane gains of big tech will continue for 2 more decades, which is not impossible but not likely imo.I'd go with SPY over that period because it's tried and tested for long periods. Could you do better with QQQ? Potentially, but then you get into this game of considering how else you can increase your growth rate and the try more you try to increase the more you risk. For these long periods just stick with a simple 2/3 fund strategy that gives you broad coverage of the market.

Also somewhat related but personal opinion is: VOO is better than SPY, VTI is better than VOO, and VT is the best.It was delisted on the main exchanges and is now traded OTC as TVIXF. It's the same ETN.The futures are a traded instrument with prices tied to the nasdaq 100 index by arbitrage. It is similar to how QQQ is tied to the nasdaq 100 index by arbitrage. While the market is open, if the futures are priced too high, a market maker can buy nasdaq stocks and short the futures until expiration or until prices converge for a risk free profit, and vice versa. So the futures should track the index very closely.  

Btw, investing.com is a CFD site. The "buy" and "sell" buttons there will mean buying and selling CFDs on the futures, not the futures themselves. This is also why investing.com is able to show moving prices on saturdays while the futures market is closed.Pros:

* You can let professionals take the wheel and don't have to stress about it.
* Less likely to lose a bunch of money based on emotion

Cons:

* Sometimes they use overly conservative strategies which can lead to lackluster gains
* Some companies are shady and pick high-expense funds that they get commission on.
* Professionals don't usually beat the index, which means you are often losing money after fees compared to just buying VOO or VTIAsk is the lowest price someone is publicly willing to sell to you. You will reliably get that price max unless you were buying more than are on offer at that price. You might be able to get a price somewhere between the mid (105.15) and ask.It would not be $104.30 per contract.  That's per share, and the contract is for 100 shares.  So you must multiply the bid/ask price by 100 to get what you'd actually be paying - thus, $10,430 for that single contract.So let me get this straight...you lost a lot of money due to bad stock picks, and to fix this you want to make more stock picks?  Maybe drop the sunk cost fallacy and just do all indexes - because they work, and prevent you from gambling.You can probably transfer your stocks directly between accounts. In the US this is called ACATS, but I don't know about the UK.AFAIK Transmerica is known for fees and/or high ER fund options, I just browsed their fund options and there were some reasonable ERs, but they did have high-ish minimums, and the majority of fund options did have higher ERs

Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab are all good options for no fee, low ER fund options 

If your goal for these discretionary funds is long term retirement savings, make sure you're maxing out tax advantaged accounts like an IRA before contributing to taxable, you can open at IRA at any of those brokers I mentioned, see the PF wiki page on [IRAs](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/iras) for more infoI wouldn't use that.

If you have a low risk tolerance and want to protect against black swans while keeping a reasonable rate of return, then I would look into the Larry portfolio.

Basically, the equities side is invested all in domestic and international small cap value stocks (risky but have outperformed the market historically according to academic research) and emerging markets, but it only makes up 30% of the portfolio. The rest of the portfolio is invested in intermediate US government bonds.

See [here](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2020&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&showYield=false&reinvestDividends=true&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=DFSVX&allocation1_1=15&symbol2=DISVX&allocation2_1=7.5&symbol3=VEIEX&allocation3_1=7.5&symbol4=VFITX&allocation4_1=70&allocation4_2=40&symbol5=VTSMX&allocation5_2=36&symbol6=VGTSX&allocation6_2=24) for a demonstration of historical performance. The Larry Portfolio has returned about the same as a 60/40 portfolio over the last 23 years with much less volatility.

Note that past performance is not indicative of future returns. There are some people who claim that small cap value stocks will not continue to outperform in the future as they have failed to do so over the last 5 - 10 years.

EDIT: I didn't notice your time horizon. Maybe you should consider not investing in equities at all if your time horizon is 5 years.Managed long vol sounds attractive but it's hard to know if it's worth it without seeing their returns in good times and bad. Simply buying VIX products or long vol option spreads is a costly bet long term and not worth including in a portfolio. But if they can manage to reduce the costs (and don't add too much of their own in fees) then it should be a nice diversifier. I don't know if anyone on this sub has invested in Mutiny or Artemis or other managed long vol hedge funds.Consider https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/windfall

Going for “Short term profits” when you don’t have knowledge about stocks is well, something you can try to do. But you could take the money to a casino and try to do the same thing. It might work. 

If you pay off your 8% APR loan, that is equivalent to an investment return of 8% a year which is about a best-case expected scenario for long term investing. Could make sense to pay off your loan, then invest the rest in a simple long term portfolio.I would pay off the $140K @ whopping 8%.Aerospace/Defense, Utilities, HealthcareIn 5 years nobody can guarantee you where the markets will be, if you are certain you want a down payment in 5 years then you need to think how you will feel is stocks are lower than now.

People forget because they didn't live through it, but the Dow Jones Industrial went 25 years before making a new high after the Great Depression.

The point is, if you are putting money into the stock market long term it is better think 25 years or more.  If not then you may need to structure you investments so you can be get the best out of a 5 year investment.

Surety comes with less return though.sell, wait for price drop and buy back inGo read the r/personalfinance prime directive. It’s not exciting, but it’s the best way to set yourself up for long term financial stability.

Edit: link the prime directive https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopicsPut $6k in a Roth IRA for 2020 with Fidelity or Schwab.  Buy VT with all of it, or 60/40 FZROX and FZILX.  It's retirement money you won't touch until 60, and in a total world stock fund so you are well diversified.

The rest can probably go in a high yield savings account for now.>If the top 10 companies do bad would both my investments fall too much? Thanks

If the top 10 companies in the world do bad, ALL stocks will be doing bad.Yes you get the face value.

Bonds charge different rates and depending on if that rate is above or below the current rate it may warrant a discount or premium

Take two bond who mature in 5 years who both have BBB ratings (investment grade but on the lower end)

They both will pay you back $1000 at the end of five years

Bond A pays 7%

Bond B pays 2%

Lets say the "going rate" for 5 year BBB bonds is 4%

Bond A would trade at a premium it investors would be willing to pay over $1000, because it pays higher rate

Bond B would trade at a discount and investors would only pay less than $1000 because it pays a lower rate

Too lazy to do the math but taking into account the premium on bond A and the discount on bond B your effective profit should be the same on both...Move it.  5.1% over last 3 years is atrocious compared to over 26% for S&P 500.That's a lot of companies to keep track of! Did you have a question? If so, my answer would be you should likely invest in some index funds unless you plan on tracking those companies as a part time job...Microsoft is definitely a long term hold. They’re super focused on cloud computing and their undercutting their competitors in a lot of different areas. I work for an managed IT services provider that uses a lot of Microsoft services and it’s becoming cheaper and easier to just use Microsoft for everything. Long term I feel my company will go out of business and that’s more money to Microsoft.Why?If Microsoft outperforms and amd doesn't will you flip flop again?I would sell.Burn that dumpster fire while you canRobinhood isn't an option in the UK.Compared to VOO or VONG, VT has meager returns. Only around 6% average annual return.Since inception even VOO has had 13% annualized returns. Why would VT be such a better choice. Yes this is just historical return which doesn’t have any influence on future returns. But why bet money on a horse that has a history of big wins for one you feel good about?Great link, thank you. Been looking for a good answer to that question for awhile.thanks gonna read a bit into thatI see. Thanks!My bad stock picks were from when I first started out and mostly penny stocks. I’ve been profitable with stocks above $30. The idea of throwing all my money into index funds not to be touched in 40 years is depressing, could easily be dead by thenThanks for the response. Not looking for a guarantee, just some advice. Like I said, my risk tolerance is moderate. Meaning, if I lose some money (say, up to 10%), it’s not that big of a deal, but the hope is to post at least moderate gains. As it sits now though, I think a savings account is for sure a real loss of at least couple of percent a year given how much we’ve printed for the stimulus. I’d rather risk losing some value (with the potential of gaining some) through my own actions than watch value slip away due to inflation. 

I do have a 25 year horizon on the bulk of stock investments, that being my 403(b). But based on CD and bond rates, I’m struggling to find investments that would, at the very least, serve as a shelter against inflation. I’m not married to stocks for this 8-10 year timeline because, as you pointed out, they’re not necessarily a guaranteed hedge against inflation.

I was more just wondering how I could, as you put it, “structure my investments differently” given my starting sum (~$2k) and planned contributions (~$200-$300/month). Do you have any suggestions as to what that restructuring may look like? Feels like real estate, CDs, bonds, etc. are out of the question given conditions, my circumstance, and my capital.do you think I should sell on the 28th, the earning report date?I feel like my portfolio is able to outperform ETF and my work somehow offers me tons of spare time to read news and track and DCA and add into more positions of those individual stocks.

I just wanna know if my portfolio makes sense? Should I add some restaurant/ oil stocks? I have bee eyeing SPY, VGT, QQQ, VOO, VTI, DIA but I am not sure which one of them I should add.Carter Worth dropping some chart knowledge on Fast Money.

Tech sector has 2 red days in a row. They have gone 96 days without 3 red days in a row which is the 2nd most all time. Record is like 108. When the record was broken, tech had a 15% dip AFTER the 3rd consecutive red day.

TLDR: Tech broke the upward trend line today. If it's red Monday it could be down even more shortly after.Probably just FOMO but I see AMD with still lots of room to grow. Then again, Microsoft is indeed the safer and more value pick to weather the potential future turbulenceWould you immediately buy more VOO or hold off?And won't become one as they cancelled their launch in the UK.You need to do some reading rather than chasing return.  US market is never the best market in any given year, and the good returns on US-based funds are highly skewed by the last decade.

* https://movement.capital/summarizing-the-case-for-international-stocks/
* https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/investing-ideas/international-investing-mythsYes, because international hasn't been doing as well recently.

Like I said above, don't look at just the past performance of the last 10 years to make decisions. If you did that, then you wouldn't have invested in VOO on 2010 because at that point it had returned about -0.17%/yr for the 10 years prior.

VT is the default index choice. VOO and especially VONG leaves you vulnerable to extended periods of US underperformance.Because you are looking at a tiny timeframe. The US and Intl go through cycles of outperformance over the other: https://www.mymoneyblog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/us_intl_cycle-720x268.gifWhat's more depressing is putting a lot of effort into picking and tracking stocks only to do worse than the index.

You are after a thrill, which shows you might have a gambling addiction.  Keep making investment decisions based on emotion and it won't be pretty.Why invest at all in that case? Just spend all of your money now if you think you won't be able to use the money in 40 years.You can buy bonds if you have the right broker and depending on your capital.  Corporate bonds have a smaller buy in than Treasuries but be careful if you do.

No knowledge of real estate stuff, but understand it can be pretty good also.

Regarding structure, I’ll be honest, I don’t know.  For things like this it might be best to choose what characteristics you most want and put your money into an ETF run by professionals:
https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/list#/etf/asset-class/bond-attributes

Just remember that when you buy bonds any interest rate hikes will cause you bond price to drop.  And if own an ETF based on bonds, rather than the bond itself, it never matures at par - which is a big  disadvantage.

Keep a bit on a side for more speculative plays which might return a home run.

End of the day, whatever you do it’s going to be impossible to know what the markets or bonds do in a few years.  

Tough choices.Personally this is what I’d do: don’t go all out or all in maybe sell 20-60% of your shares to make that profit and hold the rest. and reinvest what you take out when the price of the stock drops.But don’t take my advice to seriously I’m a inexperienced 16 year old investor haha.It makes sense to have a portfolio of companies where you fully understand the fundamentals. I think that's the only thing that's going to give you a competative advantage. Do you know a lot about the fundamentals of the restaurant / oil business? Then pick some companies you're very comfortable following and want to invest in. Is it good to be diversified? Yes, but you should also only be investing in companies that you really understand.

The vast majority of active traders won't beat the performance of the general market (S&P 500, or VOO) over a long period of time. This include professionals that are getting paid to do it full time. You might be doing well in the short term, but "Everybody is a genius in a bull market."> I feel like my portfolio is able to outperform ETF

I hope you’re actually making a chart to keep track so you won’t have to rely on feelings.

Even the pros fail to beat index funds: [Buffett's Bet with the Hedge Funds: And the Winner Is …](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/030916/buffetts-bet-hedge-funds-year-eight-brka-brkb.asp)Look at it this way. If you believe in MSFT long term, you should stay invested. There's a very real possibility that tech will dip 15%, and if it does, the whole market will dip with it. But long term, will MSFT be one of the stronger players? Probably. If you're willing to wait a few years, you shouldn't take the 5k loss now unless you really need the money and have a very confident play with that money. Full disclosure I sold MSFT at $154 back in March to cut my losses.Buy more VOO and VXUS immediately according to your asset allocation.Your links are incredibly helpful. But even in your fidelity link, US markets from 1950 to 2019 performed 1 percentage point better annualized versus international markets. Their case is largely to reduce risk with a mixed portfolio, which is not a huge concern to me.So a maximized portfolio would hold a combination of US and international markets. So would a 70/30 split between VONG (or VOO) and VT be acceptable?You have a good point. My plan was to do something like 50% index 40% medium to large stocks like aapl and 10% options 

Do you put each paycheque into your index funds? Or wait until a drop and use a large sum?Lol I'm an inexperienced 15 year old investor so any advice I can get is usefulYup I was having a somewhat satisfying (not as impressive as investors who do lots of options) 20% return before the recent 2-day correction. I would say the reason was I was able to take advantage of March lows to generate such number. In regular days, I am 100% sure major ETF is the best. The fact that lots of leisure and travel stocks are still well below pre-Covid level makes me want to continue investing in individual stocks.Swapped VGT out for VOO. I feel better about that because I do feel like tech is hyped. I know VTI would be better, but I started with VOO so I'm sticking with that as my US fund in this brokerage.   


I am a little worried that I should have waited for VOO to drop a little, but I know that's just timing and probably not advised.That's not true. Their purpose is for diversification just as you would diversify amongst sectors and factors. Neither is guaranteed to outperform the other from this point on. However, purely from a value investing perspective, the US Stock Market's expected returns are much lower than international and emerging markets at this point due to being relatively expensive.VT is about 60% US stock - that's already accounting for robust US performance.  Usually after an over-performance we expect regression to the mean - it's not just about risk.That's very little international. VT already holds US equities at market cap.

I would recommend 50% VT / 50% VTI as a floor. A more reasonable US tilt would be like 80% VT / 20% VTI.

Also, I would skip out on VONG. There's no research to suggest that growth stocks have a higher expected return than the market.There is no way to know when a drop will occur, and even during the drop you don't know until it's already happened; in the meantime you miss out on gains.

Invest the money you can afford to as soon as you get it.VOO had about a 30% return from the beginning of April... you could have picked a random stock and probably gotten about the same return. Those same stocks won't continue to perform that way for 30 years. And to constantly switch out 30+ stocks across a handful of different industries is a full time job. You might be excited about that right now because you've been winning. But when you start to lose you will probably have a hard time knowing when to cut losses, and where to put the money. Human behavior is a huge factor here. So for "investing" for a 30+ year horizon, this sub generally recommends broad index funds and look at them only when you need to rebalance across asset allocations.Right, that totally makes sense. I will probably sell those cloud stocks and move towards VOO soon.

Which stocks I currently own do you think is not worth holding for long term?

Which other index funds would you recommend?I don't know which stocks will be worth holding long term, cloud stocks included. Those guys are well positioned to outperform, but that's why they're expensive as they are. Basically in general everyone else knows just as much as you do and the people with the most money are able to move quicker than you... VTI is vanguard's total US ETF. It's going to be all the top stocks sorted by market cap. That's pretty diversified. VOO is just the S&P 500, but it tracks about the same as VTI. I like it because S&P has rules about what gets in and might be less volatile. VXUS is international, and most people on this sub recommend 20 - 40% international coverage (US has been kicking ass the last decade but that's not always true)... So you're pretty well covered if you do 70% VTI and 30% VXUS. I'm doing 60 / 40 because I think US is running very hot, and I think international for the most part has handled the virus better. Remains to be seen if that equates to better returns.**Hi, welcome to /r/investing. Please note that as a topic focused subreddit we have higher posting standards than much of Reddit:**

FAANG: +35%
SPY ex-FAANG: -5%

The *indices* are way up. The *markets* are not. The current rally is predicated entirely on FANMAG performance.With the exception of Duke energy which I just don't know, I think all of those will do just fine in the long run.

My current losers are:

Raytheon (RTX) -8%

Boeing (DERP) -15%Jesus I just dumped my money into MSFT because I'm not smart but at least know Microsoft is a steady performerTHIS calmed down the 'emotional selling' part of my brain for some reason. I guess we're friends now.Maybe you should just buy ETF...I got screwed on WFC. I am almost 50% down. 

However, I am glad I got Costco, Visa, Nike, MSFT, WMT and AppleYou invested in Uber? Oh no why would you do thatHoward Hughes - down 34%

Nutrien - down 30%

Spinmaster toys - down 22%OP, tell us your next pick so we can inverse you.If it makes you feel better, many of my stocks from start-up companies have been down by more than 50%

I also bought WFC at $32
And my overall performance since 2017 is negativeI bought WFC at $32 too, guess I just have to do the bag holding for a while.You are buying stocks because of stock charts.  

Besides maybe INTC, these were all companies that have fallen from their all time highs and perhaps look "cheap" on a chart. Even INTC can be said to be "cheap" when you bought it when you look relative to the outperformance of all other tech stocks.

The saying "buy low sell high" is not helpful but a lot of people follow it blindly by looking purely at stock price.  What is often true is that winning companies in their sectors tend to continue to win, and other companies that cling to their past will continue to fail.  I wouldn't recommend any oil/gas stocks because the world is shifting into renewals.  Slowly, yes, but surely.Let me guess... the dividends? 

INTC because ...kept going higher and higher 

And Uber because....Uber owns the market?Intel just hit a bad break. Can’t go by today’s bomb. I just wonder how much AMD will go up and if or at what point pull the profits and wait for next dipWent hard into AMZN right before tech took a hit.  I feel your pain.Stop looking at energy and dividends. And dont buy anything to do with ride sharing😭😂 sounds like me. Whenever I make a measly $50, I throw a party for myself because none of my stocks generally want to move one way or anotherFWIW, people keep saying that Intel is the next IBM.  I hope they're right, since IBM is trading at P/E 14, and $126 per share.  :)  I think I saw somewhere that if Intel traded like AMD and NVidia it would be at $250 a share.  If I was you I'd just grin and bear it.  I'm currently long INTC, and doubled my position today.  We'll see if this was a good idea or not.You're my hero!  You should start a blog.Confederate Cotton is doing horribly.Wait till Monday.  It will probably be red.Man that is some pwnsaucePerhaps this is irrational, but WFC is massively underpriced right now. Coronavirus fears have made it stumble, but it really is a bargain right now, especially considering how they're actively going after any issues that brought it down (new CEO, for example).

Wouldn't be surprised if it hit $40 by the end of the year.just buy SPYGJesus Christ, none of the stock picks you went with made sense.Today was particularly painful for Intel. Not only were they the worst of the S&P 500, but AMD was the best.everyone give predictions like they know which direction stocks will move. spoiler: stock market is random, lots of manipulation happen behind the scenes, etc. holding position on one stock means you are giving trust to predictions, but how to predict which prediction is correct? basically you cannot, so you should only go index fund and stay safeSell losersI'm awful at this, and even if know these picks are bad. Wells Fargo's name is synonymous with shit, they are getting no new customers and rate environments are going to be very low for a long time which crushes traditional bank's margins. Intel can't tell their ass from a whole in the ground.  The rely on contractors for lots and lots of everyday work and treat them like garbage. They are already 2 years behind AMD and even more if you factor in the time required for their management to pull their heads out of their own butts. They're surviving on manipulations and bs only and it's only a matter of time until sales plummet. Exxon is going to suck until the virus is over and people can drive around again. Plus every shitty Petro kleptocracry is desperate for revenue so supply should be up like crazy.The only stock that I have in my portfolio that is a little bit down is Cinemark.

I think that this is only because movie studios keep pushing back the release dates of Mulan and Tenet which makes Cinemark push back their reopening date. I think that once the theaters finally reopen they will do better than expectations as people look to return to some normalcy after being locked at home for months, so I'm hoping it goes up a good bit after that.WFC.. looks good at this price and most likely will have a comeback but I don't like them due to past shady stuff and current bs that they do too. Bought some intel today at 49.I feel you.
I went against my better judgment and bought WFC at $32 as well. I didn't like WFC for their shady practice...Are you investing in businesses or betting what the price will be in a few months? If it’s the former buy more if it’s the latter you should probably change your strategyit's okay, i bought 300 shares of intel today, hopefully we can ride the wave up.. covered call july 31 55 at 25 a popHere are my purchases since February/march

Or did Wells cut their divi lmao.Pray for my BAC and ALLY callsLol ripI bought 300 shares of Boeing a while back at 174 and rode it all the way up to 238. Wish I sold since its now back down to where I bought it at.Intel is going to continue to do poorlyThis is why I only buy indexes.So you're saying nows a good time to get in on all these? Lol.You bought energy at a time of unprecedented lack of demand. 

You bought banks at a time where people are going to be defaulting on loans left and right and millions are unemployed. 

You bought Uber during a pandemic where not only are people traveling less places due to lockdowns, but they’re also weary of being cooped up in a vehicle with a stranger. 


Intel was just a shit pick regardless of the timing, they’ve been losing market share to AMD for a while now and if you are into building computers or learning about these companies you would have known that AMD processors are shitting on Intel at almost every price point. 


Stick to the indexes bro.I see your Intel, Uber and Wells Fargo and raise  with Macy's, GE, Kraft-Heinz.Good picks bro, just ride it out. Ten years down the road you’ll be laughing.easy, buy high sell low lolSir you're doing it wrong.  You're supposed to just buy NDAQ and NDAQ only from now on.Just keep hammering at it and get a better cost average.. your day will always come. 🎡I am only a rookie trader, but here is my advice: don't try to invest in all the different markets. Limit yourself to one or two you have the necessary knowledge about.  Trading on microchip companies, transport, finance, electric power, and oil is, in my opinion, too much. 

Remember that jack of all trades is master of none.My losers are XOM and INTC. My winners are my wildcard stocks: NIO, FVRR, Z, and QFIN. It seems like people are dumping money into high risk stocks  for the short-term more than long-term holds at the moment. I'm up 200% on NIO even after this week's crash, but I still don't think it's anywhere near a reasonable valuation.Why did you buy all these shit stocks?Tesla 570 ‐> 1500Bad earnings for FAANG would throw market into turmoil.This really puts things into perspective.Why not just call it FAGMAN?I’m scared to invest in those 5 because they’re already so high. Do you think they will just continue to grow?That would certainly explain some of it.

Still from april the ex-FAANG are up quite a bit.   Just not YTDFAGMAN*Did you just randomly throw Microsoft in by interchanging FAANG and FANMAG?

I feel like people are just randomly adjusting their argument whenever it suits them.  You can’t just keep expanding the acronym to include every winner after the fact, and then declare all the stocks that’s not in your winner list losers - that’s not surprisingly since you are making up the list after the numbers come out.

FAANG does not include Microsoft, and never has.  Technically FANG doesn’t even include Apple.

I’d like to see FANG vs non-FANG performance but with Apple and Microsoft categorized in the latter not the former.  I think that would show there is nothing special about FANG.This is a little misleading.

The OP said since April - the numbers you list are since December.

The S&P as a whole has indeed rallied back to around pre-COVID levels, they just haven't blown past that to set new highs like the tech giants.Boeing was probably also an ok  pick.  I agree some you just need to close your eyes til next year and reevaluate.You must have bought BA at the top if you are down 15%. They hovered around $120 for a large portion of the quarantine era.Uber sucks as an investment. I just don’t see a path to profitability.i regret buying ratheon, shoulda just bought boeing. would it be a good idea to sell off raytheon or hang onto it long term?LolMSFT is a pretty solid company, it's not that bad of a choice for the long runBullish on MSFT. No need to panic if you’re long.At least you didn't put your money in Tesla👍VGT and chill.I'm balls deep into ARKKSolid advice! I like SCHG these days.WMT is my sleeper pick. Stable, "essential" business that has proven it can withstand a recession. Plus they pay a higher dividend than bonds. Now they're going after deliveries and Walmart+. 

I needed some bell peppers for dinner so I used the app and 6 hours later they were at my door. I've also ordered a lot of non grocery items since I know they are same day. Mind you I have Amazon Prime.Those are good picks. I’d switch appl with amznI bought WFC when the dust was settling in 2009/10 and they were starting to grow the dividend again.  Just sold it all when they announced the forced div cut. Basically those dividends were the only profit I made over the past decade.Well I felt they have a lot of other bets outside of strictly rideshare that could take off...

And they are backed by some very big companies (google for ex) so their funding wont likely run out during covidThis guy talking about Tesla circa 2010~ “oh no you invested in Tesla why would you do that”Think it’s worth going in now for WFC at 26$?I’d average out. I’m not in WFC but it looks like it’s making a come back with the new CFO just being announced. They finally got rid of one of the last people from the whole fake account thing.Buy more. If you thought it was at a good price at 32, it’s a steal at 26Can appreciate this. Companies that have fundamentally changed for the worse are not going to reach prior high levels.

Intel I thought was rich enough to buy their way to ingenuity but they keep making mistakes.  Seem horribly managed.  Was definitely allured by the cheap price relative to earnings> I wouldn't recommend any oil/gas stocks because the world is shifting into renewals. Slowly, yes, but surely.

Some of the best returns in the market are found in sectors that investors have written off as "dying". Altria - formerly Phillip Morris - was one of the top total return stocks for the last 25 years, during a time in which its market has done nothing but steadily dwindle....won't oil companies just start using that technology though? Or patenting it when refineries are shuttering?What about things like airlines? Won’t they come back sometime?Even INTC feels lackluster as a company in recent times.Yeah, all my energy stocks are renewables. They fit my ethics and they perform well and consistently while capturing increasing market share. Oil is volatile as hell. My Brown advisory sustainable mutual fund is also doing really well.Agree with everything except the end. Oil will not become irrellevant for at least another half decade and there are reasons to believe it will stay relevant even longer unless your investment advisor is Greta Thunberg and well, she is confirmed by medicine to be mentally challenged. Even so, oil companies are diversifying and the tricky part is knowing which are going to be the big ones in the new era, just like Nokia lost out to Apple in the tech switch there.XOM I bought when oil went negative thinking it mustve hit lows and should be able to weather for a while

The others yeah dividend was definitely a factor. 

DUK I think will do fine.  They do electricity in the southeast, which has a growing population.

INTC felt they were undervalued  because they are a cash cow at the moment.  Didnt realize they could mess up on chips so badly.Intel is still 1/2 of a duopoly for consumer and server chips. Going off market cap and revenue it's actually more like 3/4 of a duopoly.

They blew a chip generation, they're behind the eight ball... But they still spend more on R&D in a quarter than AMD spends all year.I bought everything at their peak, tesla, amazon, apple and Netflix. Everyday they are going down slowly slowly. I think I broke the stock market.OkDo you think NIO is worth more or less? I'm a novice at this. I got out of NIO after taking a small hit when they announced the stock issue. Felt  like they were running out of cash to compete with Tesla so I anticipated further drops.Absolutely, the issue is what would cause bad earnings? Amazon and Microsoft are both benefiting directly off of cloud with AWS and Azure with their core businesses continuing to grow. 

Hell, Microsoft is still growing at 10%+. 

Apple isn’t even the market leader of phones, that’s Android. 

Facebook IS social media which IS marketing 101 nowadays, if you want to grow your product you have to be on Instagram and paying influencers. 

The biggest threat is some sort of anti-trust action, but that’s not happening when 25% of the stock market is carried by those behemoths.

You’d need some sort of deflationary P/E movement because arguably they are high at 30+ P/E, but they’re growing so that’s not THAT crazy.Didn’t seem to with Netflix.That's what I've been calling it... People think I'm talking about a superhero but I'm just trying to make moneyTAGMA. Netflix is doneBecause this isn't the purulent dumpster fire that is WSB.Let me ask you another question that might help you. What else are you going to invest in? 

T-bills? Nope

Bonds? Nope

A savings account? Get left on the sideline either way.

Gold? Maybe

Bitcoin? China is trying to ban it, and government regulation could wipe it out overnight, but the collapse of the dollar would make it soar. The highest risk/reward you could choose.

Individual stocks? What companies have more cash to weather the storm and have whole generations of cult-like fans and reliant businesses that will use their products/services?

Market index? Smartest most of the time.Simple answer: yes for some of them. MSFT is still growing across all areas except brick and mortar stores, which is scary to consider. They are the major operating system in a world that depends upon computers.
GOOGL is everywhere. For better or worse. As a baseline, they’re making absurd amounts of money daily. Plus they have a pipeline of ideas and early stage acquisitions to fuel growth for at least a decade or two moving forward. For example Waymo/self-driving cars and developing market acquisitions.
FB has received a ton of bad publicity lately. Social media is a digital drug. It’s mentally toxic. But my goodness does it produce profit margins. I would argue FB has the best fundamentals out of the gang as of right now. 
AAPL is shifting away from devices towards services. They are pushing into media. It’s a long-game for them. I think they see the writing on the wall regarding devices being too expensive. They are working to cut prices while retaining insane margins.
Like Apple, AMZN is also shifting away from the core identity. They’re tied in with Whole Foods. They have a growing media platform (Prime and Twitch). AWS isn’t going anywhere.
NFLX is the weakest link IMO. But a coronavirus/stay inside situation helps keep them afloat. They are increasingly becoming a Hollywood production company. Teens nowadays don’t know this was the player that killed Blockbuster video.

The biggest thing to note with everyone except Netflix is the functional lack of debt. FB doesn’t have any. Apple has money offshore. Google has very little. Microsoft has an average amount it doesn’t need to worry about. I bring this up because these companies can straight up buy the competition/startup/new idea. 

My only concern is governments declaring these companies too big. I’m not talking taxes. I mean legally splitting up the castles into smaller assets.It weirds me out considering FANG includes Facebook (a trash advertising company) but not Microsoft (a trillion $+ company, currently the second largest publicly traded by market cap). 

Decades from now, Microsoft will still be standing. Facebook will not.Bought at about $205. Bad move in the short term, but nowhere near top.Raytheon is still super solid IMHO. The US has the best defense/weapon manufacturers in the world. Raytheon is still certainly one of the best on Earth, and they are still priced lower then they probably should be. Areas of the world are in constant turmoil, and they want our weapon systems. They say only two things in life are guaranteed - death and taxes. I'd add war to that.With the latest developments in China/US relations, defense stocks might be a good hold long-term lol.I couldn’t think of many better choices long run. I’m super bullish on Microsoft right now.*checks time stamp to see if you’re kidding or not*All day every day!VGT!!!!This is a good oneJust bought into this one today. I'll be holding onto this one for a while it looks like, and hopefully buying more as often as I can.I’m cock and balls deep in ARKW and ARKGReasonable answer downvoted lmaoDude they aren't going to be profitable likely everAnyone who touches Wells deserves to bag hold. They deserve to be out of business. Change in leadership might help, but that rot spreads and needs to be gutted entirely.Problem is these guys all buy based on the charts not on the value of a company. And well since it went down they think it’s going to go down more so they don’t buy. They wait for it to start significantly going up again to buy at which point it’s too late. They have no idea what a good price is.Intel did a very good job this last quarter considering their technological limitations. They are not mismanaged, they have problems reaching the next node of technology. Before you say "Well AMD has 7nm tech", AMD and Intel refer to the size of their transistors using different metrics. AMD's chips do not use the same architecture as Intel's. When Intel's 7nm chips finally come out, they will be miles better than AMDs 7nm chips.

The concern is that Intel has delayed the release of these chips by years now. They were supposed to come out Q4 of last year, and Q4 of the year before that. Now they're saying Q4 of this year, and investors have lost confidence.

The other reason they declined is their losses in MobileEye. Data processing for self-driving cars is supposed to be their next cash cow, but they are hemorrhaging money in that area right now.

Somebody correct me if I'm wrong. I am admittedly biased, I have the majority of my holdings in Intel right now so not a great day for me.Comparing tobacco and oil isn't really logical.Problem is that their entire capital is invested in old tech, and a big part of their stock valuation is precisely because there are still investors who believe their current assets are valuable.

Yes, they can switch to renewables, but they would have to abandon or sell their existing plants, equipment, technical knowhow knowledge...etc.  And don't forget there is a lot of entrenched interest in those company to keep the status quo.  

It's much simpler to invest in a startup at that point.I mean, $0.87 dividend on $43 aint nothing to scoff at for XOM. I think I got it earlier in the month at $36. I wouldn’t call XOM a loser if you got it sub $50. It will probably stay here until the world is back to normal(ish)Lol.  Before this I decided to get big into options the week the pandemic hit.  We fall together brother.As long as you aren’t doing options, you’ll be fine. I bought AMD at peak when it was 28$ and it dropped to 18.When Tesla stock shot up, everyone started trying to find the next big stock in the industry. NIO as a competitor made sense. Luckily I had been in it since $3 already. Do I think it's worth $12 per share? No. They're currently valued at $14 billion. Ford is valued at around $27 billion. Not saying Ford is the best company, but how many NIOs have you seen on the road versus Ford's? Maybe NIO has a good future, but it will be many years before they can produce the same volume of cars. And quality is another thing. Can NIO get a good quality car on the market and maintain that quality while also greatly increasing output? It's too early to say what NIO is worth, but the recent pump of the stock is unjustified in my opinion.The CEOs of Amazon, Google,.FB and Apple are meeting with Congress in a couple weeks to answer questions about antitrust accusations.>Apple isn’t even the market leader of phones, that’s Android.

One correction here: 

Apple *is* the market leader of phones, while Android (Google) is the market leader of *phone operating systems*.

More importantly, and relevant to your point: Both of these things aren't even the only or dominant revenue stream for both of those companies. Google in particular has an extremely diversified portfolio, to the point where even a major hit to Adsense isn't going to adversely affect their overall growth.Is that a prediction? Because it can’t be an observation... Netflix is up 55% YTD.Huh I couldn't tell till you said it. Content seems identical now.say what you want, but WSB can have some nuggets of truth amidst all the insanity.Got it. So AAL and CCL?VGT.Your can’t ban bitcoinReal estate. Rental properties.I've seen this a few times now, that Apple is smart for moving into the content space for margins, but Netflix, who's doing the same, is not going to continue growth. Now, you didn't say the part about Netflix in your comment, so why do you think Netflix is the weakest link, yet Apple will be fine with a higher-margin content creation?Nitpick - Microsoft is not FANG and has never been.  It’s a blue chip stock.[removed]What about the fundamentals of BA have you feeling like it will go back up? Their financials are in shambles and they just took $20 Billion in new debts (in the March/April timeframe). Is it the blind hope that they are too big to fail? Genuinely curious what you find so compelling.And don't buy Raytheon just for the weapons manufacturing. They merged with United Tech which owns like a hundred companies. They're a big player in aerospace.How about the moon?War = deathShort term they'll be down- Dems are poised to win in Nov and have coalesced around a 10% defense budget reduction. Party platform comes out in August, so expect a drop at that timeWhisperings from inside Intel suggest that it is very poorly managed. There's plenty online about it having a completely toxic company culture the past few years direct from employees. It won't get out of the issues its having for probably another 5 years. When they get to 7nm, AMD will be on 5nm, maybe even smaller and likely offering better value in the process for customers top to bottom of the stack.

Intel does have a lot of impressive stuff going on elsewhere, and they can certainly throw their weight around while AMD can't, but I personally wouldn't be holding big on Intel right now. Dozens with far better outlooks for the next 5 years.

Intel is rapidly losing the mind share they've built up over more than a decade in the enthusiast market. These people then go on to heavily influence purchasing of laptops/office PCs of peers and often have an influence in the purchasing of infrastructure in many companies as those people tend to work in a technology field also. AMD have such killer products in both these categories that Intel can't get close to in value or even performance at the top end against a 64c Epyc.Yes, very biased. Intel is and had been a shit show for the past year. Tons of insider leaks showed a bleak future of their node technology.I have to defer to you there, as I'm not as knowledgable on the subject.  The stock seemed priced for contraction...so it surprises me that mobile eye would be such a big deal to investors.

Any idea what intel wants to charge for their new 7nm line compared to AMD?  I think it's not only that they're gonna be slower to market, but I've thought more expensive too.

Intel does seem to have the lead in reliability brand and existing customer base.Indeed - oil actually has a much better upside case than tobacco. 

[Oil usage has steadily increased since 2006, and even with covid only a slight drop in consumption is projected this year.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/271823/daily-global-crude-oil-demand-since-2006/)

Remember, we're talking about crude oil here, not coal. Crude oil's primary uses are not as easily disrupted as other fossil fuel commodities which, for example, fuel the grid. Electric vehicles will eventually displace lots of consumption, but it will be 10-20 years at least until major penetration.

There are many other differences, including pricing power in tobacco. But the way in which they are fundamentally similar is that Altria's market has done nothing but decline for 25 years. Not only that, but I picked the 25 year period for a specific reason: not only did it coincide with a secular decline in tobacco, it also started right during the worst of tobacco litigation.

I do not intend to suggest that oil is exactly similar to tobacco. I am merely reminding people that you could easily and rightly theorize a secular market decline lasting 25 years and still make money.Yup, a lot of this reminds me of blockbuster. Old men sitting in circles laughing at change thinking what they have will still work....Also, the tech is just very different between oil and renewables and so is the expertise. Companies just don't shift easily.Just realised I was thinking you were referring to NKLA, and gave my first comment with them in mind, not NIO. I guess the same applies though and NKLA is showing what happens when a knock-off TSLA is pumped just for being in the same market.So buy the dip, Trump will not allow for some sort of downward stock movement, that’s what matters most to him for reelection.And then no action will be takenBut wouldn't a major hit to iPhones severely impact apple? How strong is their portfolio outside of mobile?Let’s just acknowledge for a second that Netflix only made the acronym because it’d be FAAG without it, and they can’t say that on TV. In terms of market cap, Netflix isn’t even in the same *league* as the other members.Yes if I’m holding for the next decade. It’s TAGMA, not FAANGYou can make it so it is accepted at fewer places. If you can’t buy goods and services with it, it loses its valueIf you can't evict people why get into rental property?Your submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

Despite the 737 Max disaster, Boeing still posseses some of the best talent in the industry. The main competitor, Airbus, is also bleeding cash. Boeing possesses strategic national importance, and will be bailed out to no end. Boeing will go back up in 3-5 years.Blind hope?

They are literally one of two companies on the planet that do what they do, and the only domestic one. Plus they do tons of defense stuff. 

BA isn’t going anywhere. Unless you have this blind hope that people are going to suddenly forget that air travel exists.I owned UTX--it was the first stock I bought way back in 2011 and never sold it. Raytheon and UTX merged into RTX then they spun off Otis (elevators) and Carrier (air conditioning + fire systems). That leaves RTX as aerospace stuff + defense contractor, which is fine. Maybe people are thinking "Boeing messed up planes! Air travel is down! Therefore everything with aerospace down!"Not wise. They're blowing up the moon for 4th of July next year: https://youtu.be/GTJ3LIA5LmANot for wealthy people.The new defense bill, this week, just passed both house and senate at $740B and heads to reconciliation about the nitty gritty

Idk why people keep saying Dems will cut - they just passed that behemoth with a veto proof majority

Not everyone is Warren and Biden, defense industry has its tentacles everywhere and China is on the rise. 10% cut is over $70B and that just isn’t happening

And again, the new bill passed effortlessly

> Senators voted 86-14 to approve their version of the National Defense Authorization Act on July 23. The House voted 295-125 to green-light its own bill July 21. Each package allows $740.5 billion in defense spendingI worked for Intel until recently, and I can absolutely confirm that the company culture is incredibly toxic. They use up their employees and spit them out, don't even try to hide it. That being said, it's been like that for over a decade and they've still shown great profits. 

In terms of chips, again when AMD releases their 5nm chips they will be equivalent to Intel's 7nm, without a lot of the background architecture improvements. AMD's current 7nm are equivalent to Intel's 10nm, if you don't agree do a quick Google search. Intel is simply better in the architecture area and due to their limitations on 7nm they've had almost a decade to improve it behind the scenes. When those chips hit, they will be the best on the market by far, so they'll charge a premium. So Intel will probably own the market for the best data centers (like they currently do) and AMD will get the low cost ones. I was planning on holding until they finally release 7nm, then selling after that big jump. Now I'm not sure though.

Intel doesn't care much for the PC market. I assume they'll continue to phase out rather than lower chip costs.That's kind of where my knowledge starts to quit, but Intel is trying to exit the personal computer market since those chips aren't really profitable at the manufacturing cost anymore. I don't know what their new price point is, but I'd expect those chips to be largely targeted towards their data center business, meaning they'll be expensive.Reliability? With their 10+ security exploits discovered? I mean, physically, they’re fine. Security not so much.Electricity isn't replacing oil for shipping or planes. Plastic is all oil. Lubricants are all oil. A lot of chemical production is oil.

People spelling out the death of oil only think it's used for cars and that Tesla will kill it somehow.

Personally I think oil is undervalued right now is because we're one OPEC/Russia announcement away from negative oil futures... Once that risk dissipates oil will come right backI'm not 30 years old yet and even I'm cynical of the future of energy. US government is deeply interested in maintaining oil in a way that goes much deeper than coal.

So are the oil companies which carry pretty extreme lobbying power and will for the foreseeable future. Oil is neither Blockbuster nor coal.

I'd be interested to see which kinds of companies actually own a lot of future energy patents.Ding ding dingAnd then sell before the election because when a real Adult starts making decisions, the days of endless stock buybacks and corporate socialism are going to get, well they’ll still be around but it will be reigned in to some degree.*Decently* strong. 

They're the number one tablet maker in the world. 

Number one wireless headphone maker in the world. 

They make bank off their app store and music services — which admittedly, are highly dependent on the iPhone and iPad.

But...

Here's a question for you: What does a hypothetical "major hit to iPhones" look like?Their services segment is still in its younger years but heading for huge strength. Between Apple Card/Apple Pay, Apple TV and their MacBook/iPad lineup, they’re pretty diversified.Yeah I’m with you. Netflix rode the first-mover wave for a good while and has continued to grow because they’ve made some really truly great content of their own. But none of that changes the fact that their moat is non-existent (relative to the FAANG stocks).TAGUMAThat will change eventually, most likely by the time I finish renovation and ready my rental contract.Also commercial airlines make up 40% of their revenue.  A lot, to be sure, but it’s now like 100% of their revenue stream is being killed by the 737 Max disaster.  I also think they’ll pop when that gets cleared to fly again (which I think will be later this year in the U.S.)One share lolThe *next bill* comes out in July 2021 after the Dems take the Senate in November. Right now Dems are required to work with Republicans to advance anything in the Senate.

The last round of 10% cuts happened in 2013 under Pres Obama.>Electricity isn't replacing oil for shipping or planes. Plastic is all oil. Lubricants are all oil. A lot of chemical production is oil.

Plastics, lubricants and chemicals consume a fairly small amount of total production. Planes are not going to anything other than fossil fuels for most uses any time soon, the energy density required is too high. Shipping is probably amenable to other solutions, but ships will definitely consume oil for a long time to come.

The plurality of oil is consumed by light duty vehicles, and this is an area that is prone to disruption. But it won't be quick. And it won't be Tesla - it will be a cheaper, less luxury alternative in 10+ years.

>Personally I think oil is undervalued right now is because we're one OPEC/Russia announcement away from negative oil futures... Once that risk dissipates oil will come right back

I agree. A chunk of my portfolio is in energy stocks.I imagine this is because of the petrodollar.Maybe to a 1/2 degree. America loves greed, blue or red, we're floating this bubble until the "pop" is so big the whole world shuts down again.Yup they’re losing streaming rights as well and will be forced to create which is an expensive endeavor. 

Netflix is not a good hold imo even if it stands to gain 5-10% more in the next year or twoWhat’s U?Not a bad time to be renovating for sure. I've been thinking of rental properties as an investment in the future, but eviction suspension is a scary precedent. Best of luck!Ok... but the dem-controlled house passed it too. They’ve blocked military spending before, but chose not to this time. It’s a little deceptive to infer they only voted on it to work with each other, they could’ve just voted it down and caused furloughs like before. The dem-controlled house arms committee passed it unanimously during their phase

2013 was different geopolitics, before Russia invaded Crimea and before South China Sea crisis in 2016 and continuing China tensions

I have not seen any evidence that the 2022 defense bill will get cuts in spending> Yup they’re losing streaming rights as well and will be forced to create which is an expensive endeavor.

Did you submit this comment from 2017? Netflix has been focused on original content almost exclusively for years now. The writing was on the wall re: licensing almost immediately after they transitioned to a streaming business. 

Netflix is not going away.UberFurloughs during an election year is a poor strategy.I’m not saying it will crash, but the growth will stall tremendously. Disney+, Hulu, HBO, etc. The competitors have matched up. Netflix is trading an extreme premium that is simply not justified given the lack of moat or growth prospects. It’s done.Ehh that’s iffy man. Only Ubereats is profitable rn. 

I’d throw in some $$ there though. The working model that would make ride sharing profitable benefits Tesla more.I guess we’ll see in November, I just don’t see the dems as that innocent in military spending. I thought it was deceptive to dangle the base name change out there as a win while pushing the dollar amount for the bill under the rug. All I’ve seen from Biden is that we have to spend smart but no confirmation on what that means

Regardless Raytheon should be great long term, their depressed valuation is entirely from the Pratt and Collins sides of the company which depend on commercial. They’ll be leading the hypersonics pack and that’s one of the more important programs going forward. If there’s an election dip I’ll load up on shares

L3Harris is another one that makes key high tech equipment that would also be entirely budget cut resistant. Kratos is another that’s heading into autonomous drones which won’t get cut but I think it’s about to get gobbled up by Lockheedi will not be so sure about that.

In Asia, Netflix is the de facto leader in movie streaming business. In fact, Netflix has gone so far as working with Indonesia government to have their content aired in the most conservative government TV channel, and then some.

The word "netflix" itself has become its own verb almost synonymous with "google" in the early age.

That said, i am not convinced about its stock price though. Seems high, but the prospect of the business is still as good as ever.**Hi, welcome to /r/investing. Please note that as a topic focused subreddit we have higher posting standards than much of Reddit:**

The 2008 crisis began in housing/real estate with little reaction in the stock market until banking and credit markets froze. That’s when unemployment climbed and the market tanked. 

So far in this crisis, we’ve seen unemployment grow but enhanced unemployment payments, eviction moratorium, business loans, and Fed support of credit market has kept things relatively calm. 

If during this time we had gotten control of virus transmission we’d be in good shape. But we still have widespread community transmission and all the unemployment and housing support are about to expire.2020 is the 2006 of 2008You can't speak of this crisis as thought it's already behind us.   The economic challenge has hardly even begun and the virus part is still getting worse by the week.

The market has held up because the gov't is basically paying the bills of the unemployed.  That isn't sustainable.   I don't know how it ends but it will end somehow.  That's the part that will probably be worse than 2008.2008 didn't happen overnight and it took a while for the extent of the problem to set in and the markets to react.

We're still not past this problem and have no idea what kind of damage will be done before it's over. Right now the economic impact has been in certain areas but it'll bubble up to other sectors pretty fast. 

I'm pretty optimistic long-term(5+ years out) but short term, I think it's a total crap shoot.1. Economic pressures haven’t hit the financial markets yet due to unprecedented government actions. Fed bought 3trillion and congress approved 3 trillion within weeks. The economy is certainly being backstopped for now. But the effects will be felt as soon as the fed and government puts their feet off the breaks. Or if the pandemic gets worse than it is now which is becoming more and more likely as fall/winter season approaches. 

2. Not being worried is actually pretty worrying. It’s normally good to be optimistic but in certain times of uncertainly it’s better to be wary than it is to be blindly hopeful. That’s how unexpected bad news can make a bad situation worse.

3. I cannot stress that we haven’t even begun to see the economic ramifications yet. Entire supply chains and industries will be drastically affected after the temporary period ends. Who knows how far the hospitality industry will come back. What will all those millions of people that rely on those jobs do after the pandemic ends if those jobs don’t come back? Government action seems like the only solution. But again this crisis will likely last years.2008 was a financial crisis. Of the financial news was gloomier. 

Covid is an economic crisis. You wan't gloom? Head to your local food bank or advertise an entry level job and watch the barrage of very over qualified people pin their hopes on you.1. The market is betting on a vaccine. The news of successful trials is good for the market.
2. When everything crashed this year, it was because we didn't know up from down. Now we've proven that while inconvenient, the economy will survive this. People will still shop and eat, albeit in modified format.Winter is coming😂he thinks the economic crisis already happened 😂2008 ended up being a financial crisis.  Of course it was scarier.  You had all the dollar/your retirement accounts will be worthless.  Gold to 5k, nay 8k.  For quite a while it felt hopeless as nobody wanted to do anything to fix the issues. 

If we had no PPP loans, unemployment checks, loans to the airlines, etc. this would feel much worse now too.I guess this is an unpopular opinion in this sub, but 2008 was way worse. The hole banking system was in risk of collapsing. I agree that we haven't seen the full extent of 2020 crisis, but I feel like at least the financial sector (backed by tremendous incentive packages worldwide) was much better prepared for this oneIt has barely started yet, I’m a Brit and October is going to be our crisis point, when the furlough scheme ends, and the unemployment that was put on ice kicks off. It’s also worth mentioning that it isn’t just about how bad the fall in the stats is, but also how much structural damage is done, a fall of twice the size that is easily undone with a V shaped recovery, and a collapse followed by flat growth, like 2008, are very different.I think the main reason for the optimism is because there was an actual economic collapse in 2008. Right now, there's a Covid health crisis and that is causing a 'temporary' economic crisis. Most of the people thing that everything will go back to normal once Covid is contained. The jobs lost will be regained, and there'll be minimal damages to the overall economy. The government has been printing endless money to make sure it doesn't turn into a full-blown economic collapse.

Also, there are more 'work-from-home' jobs now, so those people will feel a sense of job security.That's because it was a housing crisis. A good portion of the country knew someone that was losing their home.Was it worse because that was your first crisis that you lived through and now you are more prepared?

For brand new investors 2008 is something you read about and hear stories from older investors but right now OMG look whats happening to my portfolio!!!!!

keep in mind that "2008" took over a year till things stabalized in Spring 2009 market wise, though the bleeding of jobs was just starting.

We are only 4 months into Covid here in the US. Next spring we can see what happens and do more accurate comparisons.Wait till unemployment runs out for 30 million people...then it might start feeling worsewhat's weird is that this is way worse than 2008 and everybody seems to think it's nothing, that's the scary partIt has been worse since 2008 for 95% of the population. This is just a tipping point.This is a slow train wreck, whose financial effects have been delayed by financial stimulus.It could be because last time the market went down the toilet. Once the stock market crashes it will feel worse.im pretty sure over 1k people a day dying is a lot worse.

&#x200B;

the difference this time around is that the gop has the presidency, so theyre not obstructing aid, like they did with obama and the years that followed.America ran a higher budget deficit in June alone than the entire value of the TARP bailout. Add to that however many trillions of QE we have had since March, and the fact that the Fed is literally trapped at 0% interest for the foreseeable future and this bullshit is held together with spit and duct tape.

The only difference between now and then is the GOP Prez needs a good "economy" (read: stock market) to avoid slaughter in November. Thus the actions they are taking above at magnitudes that they NEVER would have gone with under Obama.

But if Biden wins and Mitch keeps the Senate, look the fuck out below. It will be 2008 all over again and budgets and austerity and fiscal responsibility will be all the GOP suddenly cares about again (after driving the country off a fiscal cliff for the 2nd consecutive GOP presidential administration, of course).Like we're not going to have an even bigger economic crisis this fall/winter... Stock market more disconnected than ever.

It's 2020, the perfect year for the bubble to burstIf you own a small business and you will feel it. They are forced to shutdown. Its not just financial sector in 08. Its everything. Even big public companies are on the line but they are borrowing cheaply from the fed and investors to stay float. The calm won't last long. USD will be the breaking point IMO.2020 isnt over yet. Earning are coming in now and unemployment benefits are about to run out. More people are about to be on the streets and not able to pay bills and rent and buy shit. 

It's not over. It's a slow spiral.With all the stimulus payments and furloughing going on the shit hasn't actually hit the fan yet. The insolvency phase is about to start. Think of it like a looney tunes cartoon where we've run off the end of a cliff but we're not falling just yet as we still haven't looked down>The covid crises is supposedly worse. All of the metrics we have so far seem to indicate that this is worse than 2008 by a longshot. But it just doesn't feel like it. The people in my life seem to be doing well. I don't sense the same fear and anxiety in news and media that I did in 2008. I don't feel overly worried about my long term financial situation. And I don't fear the economic future of the country.

By what metrics? 2008 was essentially a housing crash and, well, most people live in houses. It's also where most people have the vast majority of their equity. In other words, people's net worths were decimated in a very short amount of time, not to mention the big banks and financial firms.

Nothing like that has or is happening now. What we have now is an unemployment issue, but the vast majority of families still hold equity in their houses, which have remained stable.the credit system was doing fine before the pandemic. 

2008 was a credit crisis

2020 is now an income crisis

it might feel ok now, but the economy is teetering on the brink of total decimation unless the government figures out a comprehensive plan to mediate the fall out... 

this might be worse than 2008People were losing homes in 2008 which is why it was worse. Housing bubbles are devastating to families.The cards for "2008" started falling in 2007, but the reality of the impact on main street didn't reverberate through wall street until 2008...and even then McCain was running for president on the platform of "the fundamentals of the economy are strong." Then the bottom fell out in 2009. Job losses didn't begin to stem until later that spring, and even then it was just 'less job loss than 900k/mo.' 

We hit 25 million jobless claims in about 2 months in 2020, about 20% unemployment rate nationally. By comparison to 2008 that is INSANE. For reference, Obama visited Elkhart County, Indiana to tout his response - arguably the worst hit county in the nation...which hit 21.5% UE county-wide. Nationally it wasn't even remotely close to that figure (yay dependence on RV industry). As a public employee, this didn't catch up to us until 2011 when tax rev loss and idiotic austerity forced RIFs at schools nationwide. I was lowest on the totem pole in a dept of 11 that kept my job (#9).

With hindsight, February was the first sign of a downturn (even before COVID19). 

2008 was a year in the making. Do you know how you'll feel come March '21? How about a year from now? We are 6 mo in rn. If you're a public employee...watch out in 2023-24. At this point in "2008" it was still 2007 and nobody knew anything except 'gas is fucking expensive.'Are we really having this discussion? *How many people died in 2008?*We're still in the denial stageIn 2008 the Fed increased their balance sheet by $3T over 4 years. In 2020 the Fed increases their balance sheet by $3T over 2 weeks. Don’t underestimate the effect that can have.I'm reading the comments and some of yall are gonna have a rude awakening come q4. if you think the whole world can go through something of this caliber and not have a few aftereffects you're fooling yourselves Im trying to think of a significant difference between them other than COVID.

 In 2008 it was the public who became overindebted when their house equity collapsed. But in 2020 it's the Fed shouldering the debt by printing more money and giving it out helicopter style.


 As an aside, isn't it cute when the party of staunch anti-Keynesianism gets in power and become the biggest Keynesians in the history of the world?


 Now add back in COVID and people are wary of debt and not spending for economic and public health reasons.

 Consumer facing businesses are spending more: More for labor, more for cleaning/social distancing renovations while not being able to handle the same customer volume.

 So: Business costs are rising. Consumer demand is down. Government debt is rising at a staggering rate.






 I don't know how all of this will shake out but it wont be good.Just an FYI, this is significantly worse than 2008. The only reason you’re not feeling it yet is because there haven’t been evictions. Those should start soon because the eviction blocks are running out. The CARES act is also almost over. 

Shit is going to get exponentially worse - save your cash.In 2008 if you look at the stock charts there was a decline then a bump / plateau for about six months after the bailouts then a crash. This time there was a crash then massive bailouts and market manipulation resulting in a stock boost. I suspect a crash before year end as the optimism of the populace is replaced with the reality of the situation. The caveat is if the government drives inflation so high prices could stay the same as money is worth severely less. But I don’t think even the government can cause us to ignore reality forever.Because the fed is printing money to support business and ppp loans are given out to smaller corporations . 2008 was bad because of bank collapse but government intervened with bailout packages . They did now before the collapse started . Employees are still laid off because of less revenue . Things are gonna go to shit before it feels normalI mean it just started...the whiplash will come to make you “feel” it down the road so don’t worry2008 was a financial crisis. The financial crisis has not started...yetA few big differences:

1. The extra $600 per week of unemployment benefits does a LOT to take the sting and urgency out of losing your job. Many people are making more while unemployed than they did while working, which means they're going to be less likely to be panicked or depressed. There wasn't anything like that in the aftermath of 2008; there were *extended* benefits (whereas you'd normally be cut off after six months, extended UE pushed it to twelve) but the dollar value of those benefits wasn't increased.

2. Earlier in the crisis--to a lesser extent now--the feeling was that coronavirus would be a temporary blip, that everything would go back to normal in a few months once the virus was eliminated. Which meant that if you lost your job in March you could tell yourself a comforting story that bonus unemployment would easily tide you over until you went back to work in June or whenever. Less stress, more optimism versus 2008 when if you lost your job, it felt like it could be forever.

3. The Federal Reserve REALLY got ahead of a potential financial crisis and nipped it in the bud. For about two weeks in the middle of March there was a very real possibility we'd see a credit crisis (even agency RMBS was blowing out, which is... weird) but the Fed acted quickly and decisively to stop it. Whereas in 2007-2008 it was allowed to fester to the point of causing near economic collapse during that fateful week in Sept. 2008.In my opinion, the real economic hurt just isn't here yet. I work with a local school system, and here's what's on the horizon:

1. Hundreds of thousands if not millions of parents that cannot work because K-12 education is closed and they can't afford childcare. For those school systems that don't close, get ready for huge flare ups of COVID which will shut down state and local economies. The idea that six year olds will social distance isn't based on reality--especially if their parents believe it's a hoax.
2. Huge swaths of childcare centers closed and won't reopen after the spring fallout of COVID-19.
3. In many counties and municipalities, particularly in rural America school systems are the largest employers (including where I work). Going full online means no need for bus assistants, instructional aids, custodians, reduced capacity for childcare workers, secretaries... they're all looking at layoffs. 
4. AND they're all looking at layoffs as expanded UI is going away. No/reduced income for the whole fall is not going to make for a great holiday shopping season, which is often annual stimulus.

The fall is going to be tough, but people will have E-FMLA under the CARES act for a few months and basic UI. However, if there is not a widely available vaccine by January and Congress doesn't pump a whole lot more money into the economy everything is going to totally fall apart.They hadn’t invented the money printer meme yet in 2008. That’s literally the only reason you feel like things are better off right now. And, by the way, this strategy is the definition of kicking the can further down the roadWe are not "there" yet IMO. things didn't feel so bad in, say, early-mid 2007 (or even early 2008).

we are what, 4-5 months into this? Patience, young one.Helps when fed jumps in right away with hundreds of billions of cash payouts.We aren’t in the crash.Everyone learned a lot from 08.  The government and fed are doing a better job keeping everything stable.Bear Stearns collapsed in March 2008. 
Lehman Brothers didn’t bankrupt until September of 2008. 

Between March and September no one thought there will be a financial crisis. 

We’re just in beginning of Covid Depression, the calm before the storm.It hasn’t even started yet. Things are going to collapse in November regardless of who wins the election2008 during the stock crash, our lives were largely unaffected.  2010 - 2011, however, was really bad, we were furloughed, many, many friends left town because there was no work or they were trying to get out of mortgages that were twice the value of the home they owned, we had tons of empty storefronts.  I don’t think our city actually totally recovered before this hit.Yeah absolutely, 2008 felt hopeless for so many people.

2020 is bad but it’s not on the same level of economic losses and unemployment2020 has a hope that it is only temporary though things could get a lot worse if it continues to be prolonged, EI runs out, mortgage/other deferments end etc.You're right. Government assistance is helping greatly. A lot of the things I thought would happen, stock market and housing declines, people selling cars and toys( boats, RVs) contractors struggling for work haven't happened yet where I live in Arizona. Many people are putting in pools, people doing renovations, building new homes/condos, commercial warehouses. Housing prices still high due to lack of inventory/availability. I think we may see this in the next 3-6 mos as business restart layoffs, with more bankruptcies, but who knows.Market is being artificially inflatedRemindme! 12 monthsYour forgetting how long it too to get to that point. Wait a few more weeks and then the gloom will set in. As we find ourselves in this impossible work/school quandary. 

If the monthly payments come it might stave it off for a bit but only till inflation/deflation starts taking hold.Everybody got direct financial aid from fed. That’s the difference... The pain has been delayed after the election.I work at a hospital and we're watching unit after unit be converted into COVID wards. We are increasingly short staffed as staff members fall ill.

 I took care of a coworker who was on high flow oxygen after working with her just a few weeks ago in seemingly perfect health.

Meanwhile, the people in our large city continue to resist all mask orders because they think it's all fake or not a big deal.We're in an economy on life support. It will eventually start to disappear then the real wreckage will be seen.I don't think we've seen the full effect from COVID yet. Bars and restaurants are still most closed here at least. Some can operate with 25% capacity or with outdoor seating. Bars/nightclubs are closed. Music venues are closed. Movie theaters closed. Larger events that bring in money to cities canceled. I'm sure there's much more than that I'm not even aware of. We're going into month 4-5 months of this so far with cases ticking up again. Who knows what the fall/winter will bring and an actual resurgence of it. Small businesses are hurting. Lots of people on unemployment. Yet, we're just printing away to make things temporarily right.

The difference with this and with 2008 is that 2008 was a "real" crisis. Meaning, it was a perfect storm of a lot of financial things coming together and going nuts. It didn't necessarily have an "end date" or timeline, thus uncertainty. Honestly, if the Fed didn't step in then, we probably would have ended up a lot worse. The cascading effect of mortgages, banks, defaults, etc.

COVID's different. We generally can see there's probably a 2 year life span of this (up for debate), but it's probably going to come in waves, then taper off. At least emotionally, people can process that more. Unfortunately with COVID, poorer people are more effected and those with higher level jobs seem less effected. Whereas in 2008, everyone was effected and you could argue wealthier people even more.Give it 6 months...That’s bc the republican gov is choosing to print more money (the trillion dollar stimulus package) and inflate the US dollar, devaluing it, rather than have us suffer a recession. 

Notable countries like Germany, Venezuela, Brazil, etc also went this rout. 

This is why the stock market is going “up” with no earnings. There’s more money in it than there was before.Thats because it was. This is overhyped nonsenseIt is tough to feel pain when the govt is spending an additional $3 Trillion a quarter. There will be pain when govt spending declines or if it turns to inflation.I agree, but this isn’t over yet.There was no Robinhood in 2008This is the difference between a recession and recession combined with a financial crisis. Banks are healthy and well capitalized. We have seen unprecedented fiscal stimulus and monetary easing. Most publicly traded businesses have been able to borrow plenty of capital to survive another 6-18 months of crisis.2008 felt worse because 2020 ain't over yet. We are nowhere close to the end of the pain.Maybe it’s because you’re older / at a different stage in life?It’s because the people who can own stocks are the least affected by this crisis.  Therefore, many are out of touch with the reality of it.  The housing crisis affected all wealths and was more spread out.  This affect low-income blue collar workers the most.  And if you are in those fields, for example I am a dancer, it is absolutely terrifying.  The performing arts industry is completely dead.It all depends if this is over or not. Bottom took 16 months in '08. If this is all we're getting this time then no question that was a lot worse.Given we are subscribed to r/investing the “feeling” is going to be an echo chamber of less effected individuals (more disposable income and more successful ppl generally).

Subscribe to other channels where the service industry is plentiful or the SMBs that are bankrupt or running at 25% and in the midst of a forebearance and you start to see more of the panic.

r/personalfinance as of late has had posts in the past couple weeks that have me tearing up.  And that’s just the brave ones that aren’t too embarrassed to ASK for help...Wait til the Fed/stimulus candy high runs outThe reality of this has not hit yet.Well, it hasn't really started yet.That's because the banking crisis hasn't started yet.

What until long term rates are so low all the banks are in crisis again.Buy gold. Covid has made me a wealthy man.The question is...

Are we in 2008 yet?

A lot hinges on what happens when stimulus and whether another bill is passed.

The stock market is fine. For now...This is my analysis,

You can check Dow Jones/S&P 500 for example, in 2008  the decrease was around 60%, while around 30% for 2020. This is why some people have fear of a second wave/dip. Some industries benefited from COVID, which helped absorbed some of the losses , but then The fed started printing and created a bubble/inflation.



I mean just take a look at inflation rate/unemployment rate, then take a look at the markets. It doesn't make sense at all. So to be safe, expect another hit from now until election.You obviously don't know someone that has DIED of covid. 140,000 people have died, and you have the fall to say that a financial recession was worse. The two years don't belong in the same sentence, much less actually compared.It was worse.Not feeling worried is exactly when you should be worried.

Theres a massive debt bubble about to burst.  The fed kept it going so the 1% can get out before the rest.

Most of the middle class are financing their lifestyle though debt rather than wage gain.  This debt financing has reached its peak as we are close to the 0 bound along the yield curve.

Without stimulus the house of cards fall.  But the government cant stimulate endlessly.

It may feel fine but economy is worse than the great financial crisis. Yoh will feel it once stimulus stops.Age brings experience.totally agree. I think this sub's demographic are mostly younger where in 2008 they may still be in school so there may be some biased view thereYou are lucky that you don’t know anyone affected and/or getting your news from bad sources if you don’t hear any fear or anxiety2008 was like breaking a leg whereas 2020 feels like a we've developed multiple cancersI think anyone in r/investing isn’t fearing much of anything because we (mostly) aren’t the ones who got wiped out by the Covid crisis. It’s disproportionately effected lower class who were in disposable roles that were disposed of swiftly. Those unemployed got a huge lifeline for but their $600/wk expires like, right now, with no comparable relief in sight. Unemployment is still up 10% and the lifeline is gone, so this is worse than 2008 for them, but not for us who are looking at a flat s&p for the year. 

Govt/fed stepped in to give many public businesses that we are invested in a HUGE lifeline. The Fed stepped in and said we’ll pump liquidity into this market for as long as we have to. Everything in this relief effort has saved our economy from a massive downfall, but it’s yet to be seen how this effects those who got hit the worst throughout all of this. 

Also, we’re in the first Quarter, managing initial symptoms and putting bandaids on things. We still have to solve for housing/eviction moratorium, ppp employment fallout, education, healthcare, vaccines, unemployment, waning off QE (yikes), massive deficits at fed/state/local level, small business closures, global supply chain, consumer confidence, and a wildly uncertain future that will be steered by one of two old farts after what will go down as the most dramatic and divisive election year ever. 

Don’t panic right now, but be aware that we’re not even close to the other side of this.Let me know if you feel the same way in 6 months. The worst is yet to comeUnlimited liquidity has prevented a repeat of the credit crunch in 2008. It's still early days for this crisis, I think we are seeing a retail driven stock bubble as a result of the fed propping up the bond market. I think there will be another crash and it will be following a lot of foreclosures and bankruptcies.🙄TLT dropped 0.5% overnight. There's hope[removed]The fed stepped in way earlier this time.  In 2008 they waited until the last second to get involved.We'll see what happens in the next couple of month, because it looks like this all could possibly get a lot worse, but I do think there is something to be said about the mentality of people during Covid vs 2008. In 2008 I just remember so many people having this sense of hopelessness. With Covid, I think a lot of people still have this idea that things are eventually going to return to normal and kind of just recover. I am not sure that is an accurate assumption to make, but it does seem to be one that a lot of people are making.It ain't over yet.YES..... I think it was because there were not this many people 
Plus I think margin and options accounts were not prevalent 
Also everytime you would buy you would pay a fee. So it discouraged traders to trade offten.

I sometime see myself buy 50 shares and then 20 shares and then 10 shares and then 20 share all of the same stock but in limit orders spread to save a few centsMid March sort of felt that way. But I agree today doesn'tPurely from an economic perspective, 2008 was and will go down in history as being the  "worse" of the two. This economic 'crash' was artificially mandated. People are chomping at the bit to start working again, but they are not allowed to. In that way, just about any other recession is genuinely harder for the average American, as they want to work but simply cannot find employment, and that's far more disheartening (by my estimation, anyway). Right now, through the benefits of technology, many folks in the middle-class are able to stay employed. Unskilled and cheap work is suffering the most, because, simply put, what they do cannot be done remotely or without brick-and-mortar stores and without physical customers. That said, the makeup demographics of unemployment during a recession like 2008 is far more evenly spread. The path to recovery for this economic crash is far more linear and far less complex, and recovery will begin the moment that the pandemic status is removed from our popular lexicon, for better or for worse with regards to people's safety.simple answer, ‘08 was an immediate shock. the nature of this problem is that itll stay w us longer, the issues will grind on until we solve it w a vaccine, therapeutics, or herd immunity.

think: being in a car crash, and getting sent to the ER
vs
being diagnosed w stage 4 cancer..I don't think the real recession has hit yet. There is no point in cutting the public stimulus while the economy is still crashing. We are flattening the economic crash curve here. Currency devaluation and overvalued stocks is going to cause a crash, but the fed wants the market crash to be disjointed from the economic lows. My guess is once the economy starts recovering, the markets will crash.2008 was drawn out with financial institutions falling like dominos and unconventional monetary policy made it's foray for the first time and anything fiscal had Congress haggling over it.

2020 the central bank stepped in fast, we had an idea about the playbook and the federal government provided liquidity to businesses and households  directly too so it was short. 

2008 was a fascinating case study of intervention.

2020 will be an equally facitnating if not more facinating case study of centeral bank and government intervention.If you're soley talking about the markets maybe?

Buf are you forgetting the millions of people unemployed, the hundreds of thousands of people dying across the globe, the BBC have estimated (here in the UK) that the loss in school time for children and teens will lead to years of harm for the [UK economy](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-53514564).

There are so many layers to this and people need to be more alert and not so naive thinking because they've made a bit of money or the stock market isn't in hell that the wider economy is doing swell.

Stock Market != Wider Economy.Saving this post for a later date..The worst hasn't happened yet..people are getting by because of stimulus checks/600 a week PUA payments and bans on evictions...those programs can't last foreverI'm torn. I'm hoping the worst part is behind us, but part of me believes this is only the beginning. I'm praying that part is wrong :(RemindMe! 6 monthsI think the difference is there's more political unity now, because everyone recognizes this crash and crisis is not a result of irrational exuberance and a Minsky moment on debt, but the result of a pandemic and resulting government-mandated economic shutdown. 

It also helps that the traditionally anti-spending party has their guy in the White House, and controls at least one chamber in Congress, meaning it's in their interest to prop up the economy ahead of elections. 

But I think it's mostly the former- people recognize this isn't the time for Austrian economics, it's time for wartime economics.This is a natural disaster, 2008 wasn't. There is a clear catalyst to things getting back to normal ie. a vaccine, 2008 there wasn't.Wait when inflation and new taxes hit you in the face = that will be the price you will pay. Not today, not tomorrow, but after some time.We have more systems in check to prevent it from collapsingRemember 2 things.  First, this economic collapse is hitting the service sector hard because of lock downs or partially lockdowns. Most service sector employees are lower paid. Second, Unemployment Insurance has consisted of a $600 Federal portion plus whatever the state pays, which is about $400 on an average nationwide. So many of these lower end workers have actually seen a pay increase.

The $600 Federal portion stops at the end of this month, in one week.  It doesn't like look at this point like it's going to be renewed. If not, we will then feel the full impact of the lockdowns. The pain has only been postponed.You're forgetting about the $4T (and growing) in stimulus that's been injected into the economy in a couple months. A lot of what's been done this time around is a direct product of memories of 2008. The Fed is back-stopping corporate bonds. Think about that for a minute.2008 learned us that deflation is very bad.  We have avoided that for as long as we can see into the future.Major difference between 2020 and 2008 is credit.

The banking industry and a lot of financial institutions were in serious trouble in 2008.   The housing industry was really affected. 

In 2020, that's not the case.  

I will say though we maybe forming a housing bubble here.[removed]No way. Maybe in certain pockets of the world it might feel like that, but 2008 was mostly a US thing. It barely had any impact at all where I live. But 2020 is *global*. Can’t escape it anywhere. Even in places where the virus itself has been well controlled, the economic impacts are massive.Just wait.[removed]As long as you can borrow at very low interest rates and pay the minimum the economy will seem fine.I agree, but I think there is a psychological component to the 2008 crisis compared to now.

This is something that is caused by a pandemic that we presume will go away. Whatever havok is wreaked will be rebuilt in the aftermath. In a year or two, we should be in the process of making everything alright. 

We sort of know the death rates and many of the metrics surrounding what happens if you get it. The timeline is somewhat finite. The outcome (from a being dead perspective) is relatively foreseeable *so far*. 

In 2008, I feel like the timeline and scope of the problem was much more of an unknown for a much longer period. In fact, people still were talking about the impacts and things that were still plaguing our economy right up until Covid... or at least until Trump was elected. 

Death is scary. Unforeseeable and unknown doom for long periods of time is scarier.Worst is yet to comeRemindme! 12 monthscash money ain't dried up yet... 
(except coins aren't circulating much)

jes' wait.Wait until China dumps their treasuries.I'm pretty sure the 140,000 people dead in the united states would disagree. Or their families.

2008 was more heavily economic. We didn't have sick and dying people. This time the markets are actually doing pretty well. Hell I went to go buy a house last month and people were bidding 20-30k higher than the asking price.


Revisit this in 12 months and see how 2021 starts out. If the government can keep going brrrrrrrrrrr  we will be ok. When that stops we will see the real economic impact. We aren't there yet, 2020 is only half over.Why wouldn't you feel that way? A quick look at the S&P 500 chart shows it clearly was.Look I’m no financial guru butJust give it some time. Its just beginningRich whales are not willing to take losses from March crash, so they must artificially maintain the market and pump it back up. Once it will reach desired levels, they will safely take out their investments and let the apocalypse begin.No really?Winter is coming. I hope you are right but I feel that we haven't seen the worse yet.Well, this is barely starting. This is a marathon, not a sprint. My guess is that this will be worse, but I hope you're right.We all recognize the endgame this time around.   We can fix the issue with a vaccine and we all believe this will occur in the near future late 2020 / early 2021.  2008 had a lot more fear / opaqueness, no once clearly knew what and when the keystones would fall for the event to blow over.well because the price hasn't dumped. If spy was at 180 right now you'd be feeling not very bueno.Think of 2008 as a burning building, and 2020 as a crack in the foundation. A crack that currently seems minor, but say an earthquake hit! The building would need to be torn down and restructured. 

Analogies aside, it all boils down to liquidity. What got us out of 2008 was quantitative easing, but the government did not put this into effect for quite sometime. This time, Uncle Sam loaded his weapon, and started blowing off shots right at the start. Seems to have worked right? Like a cure for recession, why doesn’t every government do this? 

Because they don’t have reserve-currency status, the USD does. Given that the oil-trade and much of the world’s debt is USD-denominated, it can only be dealt in USD, leading to significant demand for the dollar. This is one of many (but is the biggest) reason why we can print so much money without seeing any negative effect... in the short term. Long-term this destabilizes the dollar and adds to the growing case being made for why the world needs to move away from the USD. Without reserve-currency status, we’re left with massive asset-inflation, and old Sam’s printer being out of juice, we’ll have to stomach the effects of a recession greater than anything we have seen before. This is the “earthquake” in our analogy. Look up the “Taper Tantrum” to see the effects of just a small decrease in government provided liquidity. Short and simple, liquidity is crack, and the market is hoarding it away in its crack-den like a squirrel. Ever tried to take away an addict’s vice? Doesn’t end pretty. 

Also interesting to note, the stock-market used to essentially be an indicator for the state of the economy. This is no longer the case, we’re falling into a Cold War with China, and the stock-market has now become the primary weapon in the world’s most expensive dick-swinging contest. 

Nobody knows for sure where this will lead us, anyone that claims otherwise is full of shit. Could actually be very beneficial in the mega-long-run assuming we don’t implode. But the journey there? Undoubtedly will be very painful.In 2008 we had at least a resemblance of a free market. This time around the Federal Reserve is running the printing press in overdrive and nationalizing the markets by directly buying bonds.I feel good badadada da daFo real tho the banks and financial system are strongYes, but then you have all the other countries in the world buying Chinese goods.Long story short, we are used to it. Few years down the road another one of those "once in a generation" event will most likely happen, and we will all feel... meh. This is our reality now.In 2008 we were on the verge of a global economic meltdown. The entire financial sector collapsed. We're nowhere near that level of danger in the short term. The long term consequences of all this are unclear and obviously not priced in.We didn't have UBI in 2008 like we do in 2020 ;) I'm referring, of course, to the $600 a week the unemployed are getting todaybecause it wasEye of the storm.I lost my business in 2008 and never recovered so I agree, but I'm probably biased.crazy?  2008, my retirement accounts dropped 40%

&#x200B;

this year... i couldnt even stomach looking at them ,  so imagine my surprise when i finally take a peek through squintedeyes and see that my account is at an all time high.I suppose it depends on what you mean by "things."  In 2008, we had a jarring, abrupt transfer of paper wealth.  It was basically an accounting crisis.  Banks lost money.  Whoop de doo. In 2020, we have a protracted pandemic that is literally crippling and killing hundreds of thousands in this country alone, not to mention the rest of the world, and, as a result, has caused both the supply of and demand for many goods and services to evaporate almost overnight (air travel, tourism, hotels, rental cars, sit-down dining, theater, sporting events, most types of group entertainment, to name just a few). Many people who work in this areas face long term unemployment.  They are now contributing nothing to the economy.  To make matters worse, we have no choice but to support those who are unemployed (or underemployed) with unsustainable debt, on top of the already unsustainable debt we had been carrying for half a generation now.  I would say the overall economy had been getting worse and worse for years even before COVID.  Sure, the markets have continued to grow as the federal government has continued to subsidize them since 2008. But it's just created bigger rift between haves and have nots, concentrating wealth in fewer and fewer hands.  If you're FAANG or a big bank, I guess I can see how 2020 is not quite so bad as 2008.  But for most people have or will soon be affected by unemployment, inflation, and the general economic stagnation, I would expect 2020 to be much worse.The worse from this hasn’t even gotten close to landing yet and they aren’t talking about it nearly as much in the news because this one is going to be worse and they don’t want to also cause a panic. 

This is gonna either cause prices to go way way up from inflation or they will have to stop giving out any the money which will cause riots right now. 

Wait till people have no job now, being evicted cause they can’t pay rent, can’t get even enough food because meat and veggies are going to get way more expensive. 

All of that will affect the greater economy a ton more and the cycle gets a next step worse. 

They’re trying to hold the ship together long enough to get to the election and then they will be more honest and deal with the fall out. 

It’s gonna get bad.Well I mean the fed is dumping trillions and prooping up the stock market.  Should be interesting what happens after extended covid benefits run out and such.  Lost my career in 2008 to the housing crash.   Got into the trades and seem to still have a job so it seems better this time around.It's not a fair comparison, comparing impacts of 2008 to the beginnings of 2020. 

But 2008 the fed took slower to response. Powell is printing like there's no tomorrow.everybody downvote this manI was in 8th grade. I had no options at all, let alone stock.2008 was worse.   Bush just finished breaking the world. The global banking industry fell apart and everyone being laid off was being laid off permanently.  This time around the economy is supposedly "good," we're just battling a virus and people laid off are more often led to believe it's temporary.  This time all we need is a vaccine. Last time, we didn't know what the hell hit us.In 2008, there was a fear of the entire financial system collapsing, including a run on the banks and complete loss of capital due to massive leveraging. I remember it very clearly as I got a call from my father telling me to turn on CNBC on Sunday evening to look at futures. My girlfriend at the time was like WTF (because we were watching a movie), but then she started calling her parents too. I was not affected at all by the crash because I had just started grad school, and all of the lost money in equity was quickly made up by leveraged ETFs. I started investing later that next year and did very well.

This year was not a financial problem but an exogenous event and a political/leadership problem in the US. The feeling was never that there would be the same kind of collapse unless payments began to be missed (which could still happen in principle if things are not propped up into the fall). Always the effects on everyday life lag behind market moves.The market/rich dgaf about poor people dying or losing their jobs. Now if BAC was in danger of going bankrupt. Sad but true.Because the stock market and housing market haven’t crashed YET.2008 felt great right up until it didn't.The covid crisis, is definitely worse.

&#x200B;

Active misdirection and refusal to acknowledge problems from the top.Ok, here is the difference, I think we are in the middle of a forced paradigm shift, things were already trending more digital, this Covid-19 outbreak will accelerate that trend.

Whereas in 2008 because the banks were affected directly, it hurt just about anyone trying get lines of credit, (which is just about every business) that right now is what the Federal Reserve is getting a chance to slow play and HOPEFULLY avoid a repeat.  Which to me is why this doesn't "FEEL" as bad.  We still have credit markets working, (for the time being at least).

I get the civil unrest and all, but let's be honest that's always there in some way, shape, or form.  So I wouldn't get caught up and let that be the doomsday instrument.  However something does need to be done with the real wages, but that's a whole different arguement.

I figure much less in the travel and food related industries for obvious reasons at least for the next few years, (2-3).

Also I think those travel dollars will likely get reallocated into different sectors, so people are home more now, I can see home remodels, purchases / upgrades to homes happening, new home electronics, furnishings, appliances, etc.

What if people work from home more permanently because of this?  Office space in the home, even moving to lower cost of living areas could see a boost and conversely large over priced cities would see a decline.  Conversely companies can spend less on office space.

I also tend to think at least 60-75% of jobs will come back within a few years (2-7), granted they will shift fields / needs.  Following the trends I mentioned.

Like I said, I see a HUGE paradigm shift.  Which means some companies that were positioned well before this are going to do EXTREMELY well (Amazon, MSFT, Cisco) while others who can't / won't adapt (All the retailers that are HEAVILY store traffic dependent) are going to do EXTREMELY poorly.probably the length of time it took to overcome 2008 had an effect.I don't think we've got rock bottom yet, everyone still has money in their pocket and a place to live. Once this starts to unwind you should ask yourself the same questions.That’s probably because 2008 seemed to hit a broad spectrum regardless of social class quite quickly. The economic struggles of today have largely impacted the lower and lower middle class thus far....but there are rumors to be another crash in a few months which will impact everyone. The stimulus can’t prop it all up forever. Things will get worse...much worse.If stores were empty right now. I think everyone would feel more pressure. That's how it felt when everyone started panic buying during the beginning of lockdowns. People feel left out and their insecurities of having less creates an abnormal stress.Since 2008 crash happened, we are more prepared for something like this to happen again.It ain't over yet1. This is self-inflicted. Any economic troubles are a result of the lockdown, so we're basically saying we'll sacrifice short term economic health in order to save lives. 2008 was a result of overleverage and systemic economic collapse. 

2. We're using many of the tools the Fed discovered in 2008; the actions taken back then were unproven, so nobody really knew if it would work or if it would have bad side effects (I remember a lot of people saying that QE should result in hyperinflation; it didn't).

3. When big business fail, it is noteworthy and seems catastrophic; when small businesses fail, people generally don't notice, even though it is sad.We know what hit us this time around, we know what could fix it, and there’s a rough timeline.Well, the covid impact has been muted due to the government saying nobody could get evicted, get ready for that happening over the next couple of months.I was in banking in 2008, and I'm in the event industry now.    
   
both feel very similar, but this one is worse on the streets by far.okI read the news and hear about all the bad news and talks of worst recession in a century. 

Then i go to my local estate agent and houses are getting sold within days. 

People are doing fine. The lower class have always had it hard, nothing new there. The rest are doing fine. 

Everything is open now so once the furlough scheme ends in a few months everyone will be on their wages.2008 kept dragging on and on.  at least now we don't question the fundamentals -- back then we capitulated on thatListen to peter Schiff on joe Rogan and try to be optimistic. I’m not saying that I agree with everything he says, but it’s pretty gloomy.its called politicsPersonally I'm horrified. Maybe your friends and family are already wealthy. But for anyone working a minimum wage job or an "essential" job where they are constanly exposed to risk of joblessness and illness without decent healthcare, it is a nightmare.Honestly I think it’s the fact that we’ve already been through a 2008 is why it isn’t as bad. More or less people were a bit more prepared and if they’ve already gone through it they generally know what to expect. Also I’ve seen a lot more articles on people who’ve been through the 2008 crisis giving sources and advice to help people not loose everything they have. Also the fact that so much is going on it’s hard to really see the whole picture in terms of how bad it is.No as others have said: 

2008 was bad for everyone. 

2020 is gonna be much worse for most of us.Why are you all so negative about the market going up? Seriously though.2008 Banks shit the bed. 2020 the ordinary worker is affected. Macro economically it was worse in 2008. Although you can’t buy jobs, you can flood the streets with cash and gamble with it professionally. Big money has no problem with this.Quantitative easingWe haven't been through the worst yet. S&P predicts defaults will be up, and we haven't really seen any yet, which implies that there is still some time for cash to burn and then they will go belly up.2008 hit everyone, particularly middle class homeowners and those with stable, well paying jobs and retirement funds. This year the damage has been isolated to those in low skill, low pay positions. People who rent, work low paying service jobs, generally live paycheck to paycheck and have very little savings.

The effect this has had on most middle class folks with skilled jobs is that they now mostly work from home which results in them saving money, spending more time with family and overall a decent increase in quality of life. People (with money to invest) aren't fearful because they're generally better off now than they were before COVID. 

On the other hand people who were struggling before COVID had the bottom drop out from under them.2008: governments acted late, nearly by 12 months  before approving financial packages, and by then we were deep into recession.

This year: Financial packages came out large and early. And also, with possibility of additional financial packages as needed.How the fuck did we survive 1918?Maybe you’re not worried because you’re in a privileged situation rn sir.The 2008 SPY low brought the market back to levels not seen since 1997, a whole 11 years of progress in the markets reversed.

The Covid Crash brought us back to levels not seen since...2016, a whole 4 years and it only took 2 months to get there and back to nearly all time highs. The rally from March lows felt like shit because everyone thought it was a fakeout. If SPY was still in the low 200 range (or lower), we wouldn't be feeling so great.The inflation we're going to experience might make you feel worse.

There is a lot of profit taking going on, at the expense of the American public that is inflating the bubble.The difference is that the people immediately impacted in 2020 are typically lower middle class. Bartenders, Servers, retail employees. Entertainment venues.2008 was like the heart stopped pumping blood to the rest of the body. 2020 is more like stubbing your toe.The media is too busy hyping the health crisis to bother drumming up any economic hysteria.I was 28 back then and I didn't even notice about the collapse.  I wasn't into the stock market back then either, just my 401k.It’s because the US is juiced up with stimulus money, once it’s over doom and gloom will start.This is an excellent example of privilege and how it plays a role in worldview. The US in particular is in fairly significant shambles, but if you have a stable job and income, it doesn't feel as bad. I think it's important to stay aware of everything going on in the world right now - it's really really badMy jobs haven’t been effected and most people I know simply worked from home. For the white collar middle class it’s been life as usual, but with less travel time.  

For lower wage earners, they haven’t been working but have more money than they’ve ever earned from unemployment.

So the economy, as a whole, is mostly fine, with the exception of tourism.  But the US as a whole does not rely on tourism for a large chunk of GDP.

Now, can it come crashing down?  Yes.

If lower income jobs still don’t reopen after July and no bills get passed the lower income folks are screwed, and have very little savings to fall on.

This then will have a domino effect on consumers, small businesses, and the large businesses that sell to them, so eventually even big tech like Apple or Microsoft could get effected in a long recession.

So it really depends on if all the states will shut down after this second wave, and if they are willing to sustain it until end of year or even longer.  That could finally push the US over the edge.The people in congress and government in general are a lot dumber now than 2008, and more reckless now that the measures in 2008 worked more or less. Their nonchalance is reflected in markets which spreads the complacency to retail investors like us. There may not be some crash but things are decidedly different now. You don’t go back to normal when we just lost more Americans than were lost in WWI and we printed over 20% of annual GDP from thin air. I would stay in the market as that is likely where we will continue to see the first effects of inflation (which may arguably already be present) but I wouldn’t bet the entire farm on the US of global economy from bouncing back. Maintaining the status quo but with extreme caution is the way to go
ImoIdk man, I was 62008 more blue collar people lost jobs.  This time it's more gig and service industry.  I think we are still a few months away from seeing the true economic implications though.  Remember the great recession started in 2007 and you still remember it as 2008.Just wait. Show is coming...What goes down comes up long term :)Hindsight only works after the fact. We're still in the thick of this one.I think people were more honest in 2008. If things were bad, they called them out like that. Nowadays, anything you say that is unpopular will not get retweeted or posted to Reddit, hence no one will know about it. For that and other reasons, you just can't say something unpopular. I don't know why it's okay to spread fear about COVID but not the financial markets, but I'm sure it's related to politics somehow.Wait for it.... reality hasn’t hit yet.  As soon as the economy corrects, we’re proper fucked.Wait.You really need to caveat this by saying from a financial perspective. At least half a million people didn’t die in 2008It's not over yetI am not optimistic buying some of these stocks at current prices. When they dip then I will feel better. Market correction is needed.A lot of pussies who ain't buying the dip in here.This time we have motherlode [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/alistair-darling-we-were-two-hours-from-the-cashpoints-running-dry-2245350.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/alistair-darling-we-were-two-hours-from-the-cashpoints-running-dry-2245350.html) 

Here's an article from an average British newspaper where the man who was chancellor in 2008 (he ran the eonomy and was the second most powerful person in the country) says that we were were two hours away from the banking system freezing up and ATMs running out of money. The guy is as boring as hell and not remotely prone to over-dramatising.

I feel like the beginning of covid was at least as alarming for me. Maybe the scale of possibilities made government intervention inevitable, but half of the population being stuck at home unable to work or pay their bills could surely surely collapsed our economies and socieities. We've now moved beyond that to the point where the risks are less sudden and dramatic and more personal (job loss), gradual (government will phase-out spending, not stop it) deferred (national debt), and not so permanent (jobs should ultimately come back). It doesn't look like it's over, though.I made bank due to the 2008 crash, and I am planning on making bank again. 2008 ruined a lot of people but made it possible for me to break generational poverty. This time I actually have money to ride the wave with... 

I think the big difference is that we see a light at the end of the tunnel in 2020. One vaccine and we're back in business. Herd immunity and we're going back to business.When the world gets bad enough, the good go crazy, but the smart go bad.In 2008 we didn't have social media or iPhones yet. Congress was slow to make decisions effectively because information was still considered slow back then.

It also amplified information now, so you'll feel that it's much more serious today, when it actually isn't.You are in a better economic position than 2008. 2008 surprised everyone and caught most of us unprepared. You learned and protected yourself.The vast majority of people are doing well. Turn off the news.We haven't hit 2008 yet.  We're still in 2007 until the tons of folks without jobs run out of money.  We're still fine as long as people think this thing is going to go away by Christmas.  We're fine as long as people assume a vaccine is going to exist and that enough people are going to get it and everything's going to be fine before the end of the year. 

The stock market looks far enough ahead to understand short term catastrophe as long as there's a solution in sight.  The housing crisis was (as most man-made disasters like that) unpredictable in its end both in duration and severity so everything panics.  Even though it's not really logical to panic.  

If these tests don't go well and we get word that it'll be 2-3 years for a vaccine or more to be safe and distributed, I think that'll break a few things.  Because we assume it'll be safe before the end of the year (which realistically it probably won't be, but hey let's not break bubbles) the market isn't freaking out.  Any dips and dives are more Presidential related right now I think.This is much MUCH worse.  2008 was a banking crisis.  Right now, we have an everything crisis.America has of the 26% of the total cases and 23% of the total deaths while simultaneously seceding our seat as a global power in other ways. I was young in 08, but on paper this seems worse overall.The media plays a huge role. Right now there are so many things happening that the media focuses on what THEY think it’s important... its a shame since there is so much suffering and the media does not cover.Nope this is much worseNothing makes any sense right nowIn 2008 the elites had to scare you into letting them give each other a bunch of public money and it worked. Now they’re trying to keep poor people from getting scared and angry by acting like it was no big deal to just stand on the tracks and wait for the train to hit us.

Just saying that sounds so absurd, it’s no wonder I’m in r/conspiracy all the time trying to find some story to make sense of this other than the world is run by monkeys clicking buttons randomly.Election year + media is at war with Trump and his administration. 

All stats aren't equal and the media purposefully misleads statistically information to create a narrative and in all honestly to drum up business. 

COVID numbers are also highly inflated, the majority of people you know either knows nobody who have died or knows at the most 1 or 2. The death rate goes up astronomically around the age 65+ and up, below 65 its extremely rare, plus the people who did end up dying did so because they also had other problems with their body. Its honestly not a big deal in the relative scheme of things, a bigger deal is preventing people from working, like servers and bartenders. Those people are getting fucked, so are the people getting laid off because business are having to make cuts due to economic turn down from the "crisis."The government wants to control us all they do as they wished.2008 was way worse. People here saying that the worst is yet to come, are wrong. The 30’s the government didn’t intervene much, and the Great Depression was super long. In 2008, we had already learned that government intervention speeds up recovery and minimizes downturns. Now we are taking it to a whole other level because we know it works. The recovery will take a year or two, but it will be much better because we have a better understanding of how the economics work. I’m guessing that in two years, we will have a boom and they will allow inflation to escalate to like 5-6% so that it brings down the debt level to a smaller % of GDP. Or keep inflation low so that we can just service infinity debt.I don’t have an answer for you but was thinking the same damn thing the other day.It's partly because we're all a lot more desensitized to it.Why do people not understand the difference. Back then there was a possibility that wall street was going to get blown out with no direct solution. This time? Solve the virus solve the problemDuh... markets up this year, but 2008 it crashes? What a weird post.Media didn't have the reach it does now in 2008. 
Everyone and their mother is pushing positivism in every media outlet possible, that's why it "feels" better but it really isn't.Because it wasYou're not crazy........2008 WAS worse. This "financial crisis" or whatever you want to call it is making me a lot of money and I'm not complaining.It's totally different. 2008 affected nearly everyone in some way financially. This time, it is disproportionately affecting those in industries where you cannot work from the safety of your home or isolated in an office (service industry mainly). It may not affect you because you aren't in the service industry, but for those who are, this is really hurting everyone, from the server/bartender to the restaurant owner/tour director/hotel/airline/cruise/themepark/cinema staff.2020 the bailouts came fast, 2008 they were slow.2008 was worse.  This time the government is propping up the stock market.If you thought March was bad, what's to come will be much worse.It was. We had literally trillions of dollars that didn't really exist evaporate over the course of 4 weeks....it was wild. I can assure you that 2008 was worse. This will pass in about 18 months from inception. Many businesses and property will change ownership, but we don't have a missing corner stone like in 082008 was worse. This is just a speed bump.I dont remember 08 lol. This time tho, my stock market account was down for 2 months and is now up big time, way above the highest ln february. I did however lose my extra job after school, and my summer job at the same place. But still, I dont *need* that money as I dont have any bills to pay, so yeah I bet it feels worse to you now than it did in 2006.This isn't over and you're crazy if you think it is.

It's going to take a long time to recover. A lot of the manufacturing done in America is done in the south where numbers keep spiking. The company I work for will take in literally anything we can get because demand is high and supply is so low. Meanwhile factories keep shutting down every day. Nobody knows what we can get or when we can get it. The manufacturers don't even know. They'll tell us 2 months, then in 1 month and 29 days, they call is to say it'll be another month, then in 29 days, call to push it back again...

My company downsized, all these people are permanently losing jobs and it's crazy that people are happy to be out of work since they're getting paid more with this bonus but that won't be around forever and when it's gone and you need to go back to work, you're competing for fewer jobs with a much bigger number of applicants that are unemployed. Meanwhile the companies who are hiring know people will be desperate and don't have to offer as good pay.

The stock market may have recovered pretty well so far but I would not be surprised if there was another huge crash in the next year or two.This is a slow burn vs 2008 where it was a cannonball.  I'm glad you are fine and optimistic but I know many people that are currently struggling and are out of jobs.  I would give it a few more months to see more impact.Well I feel like the United States is on the brink of a civil war with all these federal troops being sent to occupy our cities and detain our citizensWait until people are collapsing in and around their cars in traffic lineups leading to the hospitals and the markets crash (OR NOT!) while secret police round up anyone that isn't wearing the right symbolI started college in 2008 and I loved the lack of traffic. My dad had previous experiences with recessions and was always prepared for the next one so we didn't really feel it....Thats because we are at the top of the dead cat bounce. Next wave wont do shit, but the death count and mobile hospital construction that comes shortly after will be enough!What's happening right now is the media is in a state of frenzy because of the upcoming election. The world is not bursting into flames, but the media will try to make it appear so.Oh good, we are starting the Bear vs. Bulls conversation. Again.A planned reset is occurring. (https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/07/covid-19-the-great-reset/) (https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/the-great-reset-this-weeks-world-vs-virus-podcast/)2008 was way worse because my house lost half its value and my investments also lost half their value. In contrast, today my home and investments are way up so as far as I'm concerned 2020 has been a great year so far!2009 was WAY worse.  It was a systematic collapse of a pyramid scheme banking system where people lost their life savings and never recovered.

2020 is a temporary shutdown of a great economy, where some sectors, mainly technology, have even thrived.  The market is higher than it was a year ago.  Some pain for sure but not even in the same stratosphere as 2009.The mainstream media manipulation is hyper focused on BLM related topics. 

Even if they talk about economy or unemployment, taking about BLM gets more views. 

Fear gets the most views. 2008 was talking about economy, 2020 is taking about racism. 

The protesters and supporters are kind of having to ignore covid data as well because they have to be able to protest. 

Normies are also focused on BLM because they dont want to get cancelled so there is less focus on other big issues such as the state of the economy.I work in manufacturing in the auto industry and we’ve been nailed by this at all levels. I took a 10% pay cut, 401k match removed indefinitely, 4 weeks of being furloughed,  and no salary increase that we were promised for the work done in ‘19. In addition I personally was removed from a bonus eligible role. I’ve lost a ton and am happy to still be working but more layoffs are coming. I got out of the service in 08 during the recession and there was no work. It all feel eerily similar. The only thing I’m perplexed but is the stock market but I honestly think it’s propped up by the government and speculators. I feel like it will hit another low.Also, you're older in 2020 than 2008.  Anyone posting to the investing subreddit is likely doing pretty good financially, which likely means they've got a much bigger financial cushion 12 years later.  I was an entry level grunt in corporate America in 2008 still paying off student loans.  In 2020, I'm now in a middle management role with a large enough cushion to fall back on if I were to lose my job.  Accordingly, 2008 felt a lot worse to me personally, but the economy is more than my personal experience.  Graduating college in 2008 is still preferable to graduating college in 2020, in my opinion.

Additionally, it's still very early in the COVID crisis timeline.  The dust hasn't settled on this at all yet.  People talk about 2008 as if the crisis happened in a single year and things were fine right away, but in reality, things started getting bad in 2007, and things were still pretty dicey through 2011 or so.  We're less than six months into the impact here.  Things like eviction protections and expanded unemployment benefits have dampened the impact, but those won't last forever.  As bad as things are now, it's entirely possible for them to get worse.Anyone not watching the poor rioting? Were there riots in 2008? Kinda waiting for them to actually eat the rich as they've been saying more and more lately. Not because I advocate their message but OP's post just looks like he's not really watching the news.

Talks of racial tension/civil war, an election both sides won't accept, this annoying virus, a Chinese Cold War, and I'm  kinda waiting for some good old Islamic terror to shake things up as a wild card.

I think shit is just taking a while to really HIT...This is the real issue.

This shut down is hurting mostly people who were always bit players in the economy. Waiters, store clerks, barbers... their economic activity never drove the bus to begin with. Everyone who has an actual impact on the economy has a job they can still do during the pandemic.Yup, I think that is the major difference. You had a lot of middle-class, and wealthier people who got hit pretty hard from the loss in home values. Especially those upper-middle class people who were heavily leveraged in real estate.

This time it is basically the most vulnerable, lower income people affected. Service industry, tourism, and generally smaller businesses. Very high volume of jobs, but lower paying jobs.

One exception (other than white color) is blue color jobs. Plumbers, Electricians, etc.. I think they are maybe seeing less business, but are at least staying above water. Where I live, getting a contractor to do smaller jobs, or repairs was really hard. They all wanted the really big remodels, fancy projects, etc... I suspect they are doing a lot more smaller jobs now, which is probably more annoying for them, but still good money when it adds up.I came to say this. The current crisis overwhelmingly effects the poor and lower middle class more than the wealthy. Most of us can’t work from home and rely on a functioning supply line to work. I work in construction and see people getting laid off just because materials are so tough to come by. Almost everybody in my social circle has been negatively effected. My wife lost her job because large events are cancelled for the foreseeable future. We have quite a big savings, and relatively low expenses but I am very worried for this winter....so far.  If unemployment persists and unemployment benefits run out/aren't juiced up again, I have to think we start seeing a debt problem that eventually starts impacting the top 10%.and the stock market is a graph of rich people feelingsDepends on the rich person. If you own businesses directly and that is most of your wealth, you are in a world of hurt. If you have a bunch of equities and savings, you are fine.Nah. I worked at a major NY investment banking firm during that period and everyone was emptying their pockets on long term positions in tech, commodities, and bio sector.Probably richer than everWoohoo!Im not rich, COVID actually made me a lot of money....until stimulus stopsAm rich, can confirm.  Got $20,000 from the feds that my accountant had to talk me into taking because our businesses are relatively unscathed except for the covid-19 rental refunds.  More than made up for what I lost and I donated the rest to our local food bank.

2008 sucked way worse in hindsight, but only financially. 

But at least we ostensibly had adults in charge then.  Things rapidly got better and I didn't have to find out that half of my friends have serious character issues as I am now.

This is far from over.The wealth gap has widened substantially since then. The more it widens, the more insulated the hyper-wealthy are. Climate change is only going to exacerbate it. Plus ça change...Agreed. It's important to recognize that the cause of the GFC was largely seen as systemic with blame easily being appointed to a certain group of individuals or corporations, while this pandemic has so far been considered largely temporary and with no fault of anyone's. I think this plays into the bias the many have towards how quick and smoothly we come out of this (i.e. reflection of the strong stock market). This is not to say these levels are warranted, only that this bias exists.I think the government will extend benefits to keep the markets up.  Also we are on the cusp of having a widespread vaccine available by the end of 2020 early 2021.  So much money and brain power is being thrown into developing a vaccine I’m confident we will have one.  This is all assuming the virus doesn’t mutate too much to where the vaccine isn’t viable anymore.This^^ 

In 2008 (smart) people worried that money would be worthless and the financial sector would cease to exist. 

Right now we have very little systemic risk, and the little bit that we do have is ballasted by the fact corporate America's interest is aligned with consumers. If they default everyone with mortgages/loans in arrears they'll just be screwing themselves as it'll create a worse economy once we get out of this. 2020 is more like 'the big pause' than the great recession. Not saying that everyone will come out unscathed but this isn't even remotely comparable to 08. Still bad for the economy obviously though

As my TV says 'its a public health crisis not a financial crises'.There is no way Trump is going to suspend financial support to people/small business 3 months shy of the elecction day. My guess is that they are going to keep everyone on support till the vaccine begins to roll out.Financial system was in worse shape in 2008? Extremely blanketed statement...I don’t think we’ve even begun to see the actually recessionary impact yet. This crisis can be divided into two components. The original non-economic shock from the forced shutdowns and then the ensuing 2nd and 3rd order recessionary effects that follow.

So far we’ve seen the horrible data where we just dropped off the cliff and now we’ve seen the rapid bounces off of the lows. The strong bounce back was too be excepted simply as a function of rate of change math. It gets breathlessly reported as proof of the V shaped recovery but it’s nothing of the sort.

Government aid has kept people from feeing the effects so far. Foreclosure and evictions were banned, debt payments were delayed, huge UI benefits, etc.. I think we are just now starting to get a taste of where this crisis goes next. It’s going to be worse than 2008 and the recovery is going to take even longer. And that’s even assuming optimistically we don’t get another liquidity event in financial markets.Financial system is worse.... and it it will become apparent when we start having to payback all the trillions of dollars of debt we incurred from the stimulus packages. we never even paid of all the debt from the first financial crisis. 

Fed's solution to the popped bubble is pumping more air into instead of letting it deflate. 

Currency is going to lose value and we are going to be stuck paying European style taxes for the rest of our working livesRemindMe! 24 monthsare you saying we have 2 years to profit and get out?👆 This guy is right.Exactly. The calm before the storm. Right now many of us are living in denial. But the impact will be felt slowly but surely.

In 2008 we found out our tin coins aren't worth the same as gold coins like we thought.

In 2020, someone entered a wrong passcode in the safe too many times, so we have to wait until we can get our gold coins out.

Op is putting it gently: a fucking idiot. Seriously. I'm being gentle here. Covid hasn't peaked and neither has unemployment. Amazing to compare this to 2008.I know. But I still feel impact in 2009 was far greater, even emotionally. People were just leaving houses with depression ,,just like that leaving all their things behind. Lehman brothers, Bear Sterns kind of mega companies were all going bankrupt.Washington Mutual, Countrywide Financial , Merrill edge kind of companies were saved by merging into big banks. Madoff scandal was another thing. I remember Obama entered into a perfect storm and then had tons congress overnight meetings in January that he looked like zombie in Feb. This pandemic would have been worse if Fed didn't react on time. Fed cut rates to zero even before this virus was declared pandemic by WHO. I think Fed acted way faster than White House or CDC. Its 2008 experience is still new and they just jumped into action."The US has provided far less support than other countries.  Providing year long to lifetime social safety net is absolutely possible but for some reason America won’t admit it has a problem.Let's shoot for 100 trillion. I like round numbers.[removed][removed]People getting COVID doesn't = virus actually getting worse (real world impact). Yeah in a general sense you could make the argument "its getting worse" but the reality is people are not dropping like flies.But all the employers are open again and people have money to spend in those stores. Gov will get their money back by either printing more or slowly taxing people and getting it back. 

Most will go without a huge hit to their finances.Its sustainable its just that senate wont do it.*the government is paying more than they used to make and more than they would on ordinary unemployment.*Yes. It's kind of funny that with with so much access to information in 2007/2008 showing deteriorating economic data the market continued bouncing along with relatively little reaction for nearly a year. 

I don't know the future but it really seems like market reaction is similarly out of sync with economic reality like 2007.Everything you said is so true.  I remember in summer '07 I worked a job where I drove a truck with a crappy radio and the only thing that came in was AM stations and I wasn't following markets at all at the time.  I was about 20.

Anyways, one night they made such a big deal about problems with these things called mortgage back securities (could have even been something different, I don't remember but assume it was MBS's) that were in trouble and how disastrous this was eventually going to be.  I have absolutely no idea what station I was listening to.  Might have even been one of those conspiracy UFO shows.  Anyway, the point was **this was '07**.  It was a little over a year later when the financial world was set on fire.

TLDR: Tell me how much of a nothingburger this was next summer.Yes, this situation is much slower moving. It was 3 years after that financial collapse before Occupy Wall Street started. Think about that timeline when you think about the possibilities of social unrest a couple of years from now. This is the time to become more self-sufficient & decentralize from the machine.Also, the white collar job loss bloodbath is just beginning. Hospitality took the first hit and will likely return faster, industries like mine that are currently sailing along (IT) that operate on clients making big investments in new systems/features are going to be hurting in 6 to 18 months. We are currently working full time full staff because our contract was signed  x months/years in the past when client was profitable. Clients are hemorrhaging money now, so I guarantee when it's time to renew contracts or consider rolling out new features/ services they're going to decide not to. THEN I and my team will be ruthlessly culled."buy when others are fearful"  


There is a surplus of fear...The barrage of over qualified has been happening since before covid. I was looking for a designer / webdev / video editor and some applicants with ten years of experience were willing to handle an hour+ commute for minimum wage. Every day was about 20 resumes but had to close the position due to budget freeze. Our economy wasn't that great pre covid, remember what happened in December 2018 when rates went up?I’ve noticed the average age of delivery people (Uber Eats etc.) has gone way up. I haven’t had one under 40 since March.mAn ThE bEaRs ReAlLy DoN't gEt TiReD oF BeInG wRoNgYou seem 100% confident it didn't. What are your positions, so I can just copy off Nostradamus' portfolio?We acted very quickly this time, opposite of 2008, I read this might be the reason this crisis doesn't hit us as hard as the last one did.You mean backed by money printerWhat if -- get this -- they extend the benefits?You forgot BrexitDon't worry, our 10 pound meal deal will surely help the economy recover.The key question is whether we get a working vaccine by Q1 2021 - if we do, back to business as usual in 3 months. If not, things could get uglier than 2001 and 2009 combined.Businesses have shuttered and closed down. Layoffs have occurred and more are coming. Demand is contracting. Many jobs will not be coming back.I'm really worried that any vaccine will be (effectively) useless. 30% of Americans think it will be a vehicle for Bill Gates to implant tracking devices ([source](https://news.yahoo.com/new-yahoo-news-you-gov-poll-shows-coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-spreading-on-the-right-may-hamper-vaccine-efforts-152843610.html)) for crying out loud. Add in the immunocompromised, and I doubt even half of Americans will get the vaccine.

IMO, there will be an ongoing (years), massive threat of large human death counts. This is going to have a massive, long-term effect on supply and demand of both goods and labor.

TLDR: Vaccine hopes be damned, IMO we're screwed. :)That might have been this case if the shutdown was three weeks. It's too late for that now. Businesses are closed and not coming back.And if they don't extend those unemployment checks, that's about to be true all over again.A good portion of the country knows someone unemployed right now.>That's because it was a housing crisis. A good portion of the country knew someone that was losing their home.

There is a very real chance that this becomes a housing crisis too.  A lot of people haven't been able to pay their rent.  For now, it's not a problem, because eviction moratoriums prevent the landlord from taking action.  Those eviction moratoriums won't last forever though.well, now a good portion cant get a new home, because noone wants to rent to anyone because they cant evict them. i make 4k a mo. i cant find a single apartment that will take me. my credit isnt great.....but holy shit is it not that bad. im basically couch crashing.> Was it worse because that was your first crisis that you lived through and now you are more prepared?

 Not OP but I was invested in stocks in 2008, and in mutual funds during the dot.com bubble.

 I get the OP's point about it not seeming worse. But that doesnt mean it wont get worse. Some people in 2005-6 were getting uncomfortable with valuations and debt but most were cheerleading the bubble:


*"Why are you worrying? Stocks are up, unemployment is down, inflation is flat, real estate is through the roof! EVERYTHING IS GREAT!"*


 At some point enthusiasm and positivity becomes irrational. I thought we passed that point in 2019. 


 Can the 'irrational exuberance' continue from here? Of course. But the longer it goes on, the worse it is when the bubble pops.Plus, everyone keeps saying 2008 but everything started to happen in 2007, it just took a little bit of time to actually play out, and then even more time to bottomCoordinated propaganda is a helluva drug.In 2008, life in general was still pretty much humming along. You could do crazy things like... Go to a restaurant, attend a concert, and get your hair cut! 

But in 2020, with a global pandemic and massive unemployment at a scale never seen before... The stock market is at it's all time highs!? Crazy times.>so theyre not obstructing aid

The next aid package seems to be in a bit more trouble, though.In 2008 Bush was still president... Obama was elected in 2008, he took office in January 2009.What happened to the Tea Party?     

All of a sudden they love government benefits.obscuring the science instead.If Trump loses are you going to blame the Democrat president for not acting fast enough at the start of the 2020 pandemic too?1k people die a day regardless of covid.>the difference this time around is that the gop has the presidency, so theyre not obstructing aid, like they did with obama and the years that followed.

What? Obama was not president in 2008.  George W. Bush was president.  Similar to what we're seeing in 2020, most of the early Federal measures were put in place by Bush in the last year of his term.  If Biden wins in November like many polling models forecast, Trump will still be president through January 2021, just like Bush was president through January 2009.Hyperinflation?People are dying, so we can't discuss how we feel about that?To put 1 trillion into perspective, thats enough to give every person in the United States $3048. Its a LOT of money.If the government has the will to tax those not using their wealth except for more wealth then there will be a fine resolution to it. Any austerity or taxes on those who spend (a.k.a. The drivers of the economy) as a resolution will lead to a depressed economy. This is a simplification, but boiled down I suspect this will be the case.Or trade your cash for GLD / SLV. Dollar declined 5% in 3 mos.

nigga JPow will just keep printing money until covid is overHeck I was saying this before COVIDIf biden wins the market will for sure tank. There is zero confident in wall str in bidenI agree. I think regardless of who wins the election it is going to be very worrisome for investors. In one hand you have Biden who will want to increase taxes heavily which will be extra burdensome with the coronavirus impact. Then you have Trump who if he wins there is bound to be more looting, rioting, revolutions, potential coups in democrat ran cities.

November will be a great time to buy stocks. Should be a fire sale.To this point though, I think a legitimate argument for the bull case is that we are now in 2010 territory. There’s tons of terrible economic news....but the financial crisis itself is over. Banks are still lending with reprised risk, and the equity universe is having a consistent rally on low volume due to everyone being scared.p of further fallout to come like the Eurozone crisis.I work in housing policy in CA. a majority of city/counties here have issue moratoria on evictions. Vast majority do not cancel or lower rental debt, just pushing it further into the future. a lot of these stopgaps require repayment of back rent in a 90 day, 120 day period. If COVID isn’t contained by sept, a lot of families are accruing more than 6 months of back rent. And cancelling rental debt doesn’t solve the issues as it puts landlords’ mortgages in a bind. Not sure how we get out of it if money is finite. 

Unemployment and the stimulus boosted folks here. Another round will help a lot of ppl stay afloat. 

Currently, the cocktail of horrible doesn’t feel hopeless because people can’t be removed from their homes due to policies to delay mass evictions.NY and LA at 20% unemployment.All growth since 1929 was fakeRight? It doesn't make much sense comparing the 2007-08 crisis with a 5-month-old recession. Even as late as May 2008, the average person in the US wasn't really panicking or thought anything was too wrong with the economy.

Bankruptcies peaked in 2010, the unemployment rate peaked in Oct 2009.Democrats asked for $3 trillion. Republicans, $1t.I was young in 2008. I had no money before it and still didn't after.

I don't think this is really true. At least not for most people with kids.

My kid is trapped at home (pre-school still closed), watches tons of TV, can't play with anyone, is bored and lethargic all day. I can't take him to the playground because they have them closed in my city. He basically gets outside on weekends when I am not working.

As for my own health. I used to walk 30-45 minutes a day, to get to my office, and I was generally out and about more. Never realized how much that contributed to my health.

I do feel very fortunate to still have a job right now, and I know that many people are struggling.

 If you think it was a 'great economy'. I thought before COVID  that we were in a speculative bubble and overheated economy.


 And everything has gotten worse.Yeah you nailed it. Companies are filling for bankruptcy at rates faster than 2008. Yet it literally doesn’t affect any of the (99%ers) consumers because of the unemployment benefits. Once those stop and the people who once had a job and now don’t... well shit is going to hit the fan" As bad as things are now, it's entirely possible for them to get worse." 

Excellent reply. I'd reword this last sentence, though. The speed and scale of government response means that a lot of the harm hasn't even started yet. Things like job and pay cuts for professionals, for example. A friend of mine works in Singapore for a company that helps design product packaging. He's been been paid as normal and worked from home through their lockdown, but he's noticed that business is starting to get quiet. It seems like companies are cutting back on spending on product redesign and there could also be fewer new products hitting the market. Many industries that were fine initially will be hit by these secondary effects as everyone takes turns to spend less.Graduating college with a STEM degree may be fine in 2020Don’t forget a natural disaster or two in some major cities>shit is just taking a while to really HIT...

Yup, we are a few months after a massive shock and corresponding massive stimulus.  Our economic fundamentals were greatly impacted/changed as a result of COVID.  There will be a drop, it will effect the rich, it's only a matter of time.

It won't effect amazon, because amazon's fundamentals weren't changed.  Or, covid won't.  When people stop  buying due to recession, it will.

We are lucky as hell that we have the internet and computers today such that a good fraction of people could keep working,  delivery services were easy to jump to, and so on and so forth.  It's crazy how robust/adaptive our society can be.  Fifty years ago we wouldn't have been able to react like we did today.>  where were the riots in 2008?

See: occupy Wall Street, the tea party, etc.Well said. The riots were about race but can quickly evolve to hunger, rent/mortgage forgiveness, lack of health access, China, mistrust of the government, rejecting the vaccine when there is one, etc.

I expect things to get a lot more complicated within a year or so.Terrorists are literally no threat to Americans, it's such a overblown issue. 9/11 was awful, but that didn't justify invading two countries, and kill 100k civilians (obviously it was collateral and they weren't actively killing civilians for fun).

Terrorists are a literal Boogie man to scare the American public, sure it'll happen. So many mass shootings are considered terrorist actions for some reason or another, probably because they aren't brown. You're more likely to die to crazy person off their meds or to a police officer, than a Islamic terrorist. 

The Vietnam Era was arguably worse minus the virus, there was so much uncertainty, civil unrest. We made it through, doubt it'll be different this time. The public has a very very short attention span, the moment things aren't on the news or their favourite YouTuber isn't talking about it, it's forgotten. 

Or maybe it will be different this time, who knows really.And this is why BLM and all the racial tension is such a masterful manipulation and distraction. 

Corporations can't let another Occupy Wall Street happen again. That movement was actually uniting, and so much less divisive. It was literally the 99% vs the 1%.

Nahhhh, can't have that shit. Let's get everyone riled up about "racism" in the USA (one of the most diverse and least racist countries), and throw the country into a political civil war. 

Nike and Amazon will even advertise the movement on their website. 

Just don't pay attention to the REAL economic problems and economic divides that are really at the hear of most these proclaimed injustices. 💯 Way worse now than '08 but I was blacking out nightly back then so who can sayOh look, we've got an opinion-haver who didn't bother to look at what's actually going on:

>Anyone not watching the poor rioting? 

First: this is not "rioting"; second: it's not "the poor." You don't seem to understand what's going on - so don't expect much understanding of the outcome, either.

The ongoing protests are against police brutality. There was some initial rioting and looting, but that quickly settled down into mostly peaceful protests. Are you really stupid enough to think that if there was continuous rioting and looting for 50 days there would still be anything left to riot over? These are either the worst rioters ever - or... follow closely here - it's not a riot, the looting was extremely limited - and the protest intensity has only ramped back up in response to increased police brutality and heavy-handed federal stupidity.

It's also not about "the poor". These protests are happening near major cities. They are being attended by anyone who is outraged at the injustice and lack of police accountability for their violence and corruption. The concerns should cross lines of wealth, race and gender.

The protests themselves aren't going to cause much economic repercussion. However, the protests are being used by some as an outlet for secondary frustrations - and those are symptoms of likely \*will\* cause economic problems. Chief among them is the concept that "essential workers" - who yes, usually are less affluent - are being forced to work in a pandemic.

Workers are being given the choice of working in unsafe conditions and possibly dying; or (if they don't go to work) - losing their unemployment benefits and then maybe their home. The problem here is that it's really a stupid business plan to try and kill your workers, I expect multiple dumb companies will be forced to close because rather than trying to protect their employees they murdered everyone who was working for them.

Anyone in stock market indices (particularly tech) so far has been fine. But the real problem is a nested meta-problem: the dollar is in danger of collapsing because of the massively incompetent administration, just as companies are in danger of collapsing because of incompetent owners. It turns out that companies and countries that don't care about their employees and citizens dying is probably a **really bad** investment.

The rest of the world has (justifiably) lost faith in the US economy and our ability to navigate this pandemic, I expect the unloading of the dollar to continue further. It's easy to imagine that in a year the rest of the world has beaten the pandemic without a vaccine because they can wear a fucking mask for two weeks - whereas the US is still a nation of diseased plague carriers, with millions dead, famine and collapsed supply chains.stop calling rightful protesting “riots”Describing nationwide protests as "poor rioting" and "racial tension/civil war" isn't exactly helping.All during an election year. And another commenter just mentioned natural disaster. There’s already a hurricane brewing. I’m seeing the perfect storm from where I’m sitting.Occupy Wall StreetStop watching the newsDon't forget we are finishing the year with a potentially hard brexit over here in the UKThere was like 1-2 nights of riots over racial issues. What riots are you talking about?Aliens, man.I got calls on the murder hornets myself high risk high reward. I do like civil war as a decent favorite thought, i'll fade the Islamic terror this time around I just don't think the narrative works well anymore. Maybe some shorts on cold war too but we'll see how the roulette wheel spins this time .> Kinda waiting for them to actually eat the rich as they've been saying more and more lately.

Deservedly so imo. A bit obtuse to be thinking "profits over lives" at this point, or at any point at all. But hey if chasing wealth is your prerogative then I wish ya well.The poor rioting? Or do you mean all the rich children in Portland and Seattle.I think racial aspect of riots is not sustainable because it is fake/fabricated. I looked at the demands, they want quota jobs with high pay (for example opportunists at higher education) and all types of handouts.This is the only reason I get bothered by seeing BLM protests. Making it about white versus black takes away from the real problem it’s rich oppressing the poor. Why do you think rich people and these PACs for both parties are donating to all of these marches and protests.Once the unemployment runs out, the evictions start and the earnings reports come in for Q3 and Q4 then the ivory tower gated community crowd is going to feel a fraction of the pain. It's going to be a slow burn and a slower recovery. The C-level execs know this at the big companies. Hiring has dried up substantially and they're hoarding as much cash as possible to weather the storms.I’m pretty sure that small businesses in retail, food service, and hospitality have an actual impact on the economy and should not be so easily dismissed as “bit players.”Bro, just because you didn't get laid off doesn't mean there aren't more people getting laid off. I had an office job, still got laid off. I know plenty of engineers who got laid off.How this gets upvoted...I’ll never understand. Economic systems are a pyramid, and everything described in this comment is the base.Yup. I’ve been saying this for months. Unemployment is up, but as a percentage of our economy we’re talking margin of error.

Bezos gets covid and we’re in a recession. He’s worth more than about half the country combined.

Employment numbers and small businesses are disconnected from the economy because their economic impact is so little in today’s economy.> Everyone who has an actual impact on the economy has a job they can still do during the pandemic.

Don't those waiters, store clerks, barbers, etc all spend a fair amount on rent, food, clothes, and other economic activity? If we have sustained double digit unemployment, I think those "who have an actual impact" will start to feel it if those "bit players" stop spending.

They may be floated for now with stimulus, but eventually when tens of thousands of small businesses fold and the government checks dry up, the economic impact of their reduced spending will be felt.[removed]All of those people in aggregate are very important to the economy. However the Fed and federal responses have been faster and more effective this time around.Lol you’re fucking stupid. Yeah let’s see how far the economy goes without these “bit players”I can assure you some of the people who really drove the economy lost their job. Im talking about airlines here. The fact that planes dont fly much have a massive impact on other industries.> their economic activity never drove the bus to begin with.

I think you may be in for a surprise if/when that 600 weekly evaporates. the spending of this population is not to be trivialized. Barbers are consumers, too.I’m just going to wait a few months to tell you how “ insert word for slow person” you are for thinking 30+ million “bit players” losing their jobs won’t have a substantial and meaningful impact on the whole economy. 


RemindMe! 3 Months “Tell that one “insert word for slow person off.”Man it's crazy to think the wealth gap was closer in 2008 than now, you never expected it, but are we about to be living in some Deus Ex world with people living in the sewers?Right, I agree and hope the future follows the bullish story. But in the back of my mind I’m thinking back to 2007 and thinking about how the market isn’t always as forward looking/highly efficient/priced in as people like to think.Well they have about six hours left to extend the benefitsMan everytime I see such vaccine optimism I have to chuckle. I feel people want to believe we're so close to a vaccine so badly all proper scientific skepticism goes out the window.>  Also we are on the cusp of having a widespread vaccine available by the end of 2020 early 2021.

source?I also agree with what you said below and want to add; With every recession we seem to learn something. From the Great Depression we experienced unemployment. In 2008, Bernanke said to pump the market with money as to not cause deflation (which helped greatly), and now with 2020 (just the start) we pumped the market with even more money. Although I am not sure if we will have inflation or deflation over the next year. I am almost certain it could be much worse. I think we have this in the bag for the most part, but things can change and we will see over the next year and a half, and a few years down the line.Despite everything that’s out there and what you’ve read, we are nowhere near close to a vaccine. The media’s report of a vaccine is just optimism to keep everyone’s hope up. The latest viral strain of the coronavirus has already mutated so much that it is already very different from the February strain.If they extend the benefits it's an insane incentive for people to keep doing fuck all and spread the virus as much as possibleYes. If you want specific data look at common finanical sector health measures like credit spreads and NFCI. In 2008 these were at recession levels versus today they aren't...Remind me! 14 daysremindme! 24 months2022 is the 2007 of 2008This stale ass shit is *so* annoying.Yes. Just be good at timing the market and you'll be fine.With how fast things are going, I'm expecting it to be 2-3 months left to profit before we get out.What's the PT?He has no clue, just like the people posting You are here on the great depression chart when it started going up a bit in March predicting a much deeper near term fall and being completely wrong.How soCan you see 2 years in to the future? NO, THAT IS NOT PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE.They didn’t make it.. THEY DECLARED ITRemindMe! 12 monthsYou know you need 2 quarters of economic contraction before you can call it a recession right? That’s why it only just became official...r/unexpectedNBA RemindMe! 6 monthsThat's *Doctor* Michael Burry.More like RemindMe! 24 monthsJust a heads up, 2008 - 2006 is 2 years. 2022 is not in 4 months.He's saying it's the calm before the storm, not pretending as if this'll play out exactly like 2006 to 2008.  Do you disagree? If so, why?

The way I see it, we're in the middle of the most significant global economic shutdown in the history of humanity, but the economic pain has been really limited so far.  It's reasonable to assume that won't last forever.  The economic pain will eventually catch up to us, in large part because the mitigating efforts (enhanced UE benefits, eviction moratoriums, etc.) aren't sustainable in perpetuity.If they do that, it destroys anyone outside the US holding USD denominated debt. So yes, we can print ad infinitum, but it will cost us our fiat hegemony and reserve status as countries default and pick something else.It may be huge but even the US has a credit limit eventually.Nothing. Welcome to the land of Keynesian economics and fiat currency. Inflationary pressures will push up assets more than anything else, and any business left behind becomes a market opportunity for someone else.The US doesn't exist in a vacuum. If the US economy fails, other countries are still going to protect theirs from being collateral damage.Until we are no longer deflationary and inflation starts to rise. That’s when fed stop printing and raise interest rates and recession starts.*Weimar Republic wants to chat*Money will lose value if it doesn't represent goods and services. For example if you have $10 in the economy representing 10 goods/services and now due to covid 3/10 services arent being consumed (bars movie theatres,etc) now the remaining 7 goods are worth more than a dollar. Injecting cash will increase the monetary value of the goods and services that are being produced ie inflationThey can in theory continue inflating the money supply forever if and only if the velocity of money remains nearly stagnant.

However when money starts moving again, there will be inflationary forces.  When inflation rears its head, the FED has to respond by raising rates and contain it.

MMT's solution for suppressing inflationary forces in an unlimited printing press world is.... Raise rates & raise taxes.

So the FED is trapped into this crazy vortex of printing money to 'stabilize' the markets, but this repair is exasperating the impacts of the future solution.  When this top starts the wobble it's gonna get pretty bumpy.Nothing. This is going to wreck our economy in the long term and hurt the retirements of the average american.Man the bears really don't get tired of being wrongI agree.  Much of the stimulus that helped get us out of that mess was still in place when this new crisis arose.\*\*From 1929....People haven't left their houses in this crisis yet because their bills are being paid.  Mortgage companies are showing leniency this time ... so far.

I hope for all of us this situation turns out better.

I don’t doubt there are people that are still playing fast and loose but overall, this is the virus’ fault.[removed]In the US, yesodds are they will not extend the furlough scheme, with Brexit on the books too. The UK is in for a nice kick up the arseThat would just push the inevitable back a few months, and add to the huge debt burden, which is a dead weight on growth. Either way, the problem doesn’t disappear. We have breached the 90% level, we don’t want to be adding and adding to that for low ROI public spending, that will only compound the crisis. That’s without even touching in the fact that the government have already said they aren’t extending.

When the government stimulus starts to run out for both Main Street and Wall Street, we could be in serious trouble. 

The Trump's administrations unwillingness to take this seriously from Day 1 doomed us to major economic upheaval. It didn't have to be this way - just look at South Korea and New Zealand.> I'm really worried that any vaccine will be (effectively) useless.

I agree. There are challenges in mass-producing and distributing the vaccine globally, and the people will be skeptical in adopting the vaccine..

We are definitely screwed. On the bright side, stocks will be cheaper if the economy really tanks :\ So, there's that..Yeah but now the fed is paying their billsMost people I know who are unemployed are making significantly more than they were when they were employed.

In 2008, there wasn't a surge in buying of high end TVs.You should look at the house selling rate right now. It is extremely high. Tons of people are buying houses right now.

But what does the time frame have to do with it? I could say that the market will recover and be back to averaging 7% yoy returns over in 15 years.

Is that also humorous because I have no clue what will happen over the next 2 weeks?Presidential Election is what he is referencing[removed]True, and also it's not even about their confidence in Bidens capabilities.  Biden has barely said anything about what he wants to accomplish, but what he has said is that he's going to ramp regulations back up and raise taxes.  And that might be exactly the best course of action for the country as a whole, but it will certainly take stock valuations WAY down in the shorter term.  

Also, without Trump constantly bullying JPow and the fed, interests rates will rise and the days of free money will be over.

The Fed intentionally did yield control, so consumer could pay off and service more debt.

However, if interest rate went up to 5%, that chart would be very different.

Even Wall Street is begging for the government to give money to people and no one ever accused them of charity.80% is still a vast majority.Sovereign nations don’t ever need to pay off their debt, they just need to be able to service it.

It's coming...Last checks went out today... Gonna be interesting/scary depending what does or doesn't get passed.  Maybe another Hurricane Katrina? A 2004 type Tsunami causing a nuclear disaster?


 It's 2020. We gotta get them all.Three gorges dam.Hurricane season is here and Houston is gonna get shit on.Oh my gosh, when the COVID was just beginning here in Utah we all felt cursed, no joke- the stores shelves were quickly empty and a couple days later we felt an earthquake in the morning. Lol some people here in Utah told me they really felt like it was the end of times!50 years ago most peoples food came from the area they live in. It’s much different now. Just because the supply chain hasn’t broke yet, doesn’t mean it won’t.The other thing too, is that in this case there is an actual "cure" out there for the crisis.  It gives people some hope there will be a vaccine for the Chinese virus.  '08 on the other hand, what is the cure for "oops you lost your home and your retirement was wrapped up in dogshit CDOs.  Sorry."Both of those came well after 2008.  Tea party was 2010, occupy was 2011.> The riots were about race but can quickly evolve to hunger, rent/mortgage forgiveness, lack of health access, China, mistrust of the government, rejecting the vaccine when there is one, etc.

Ya know, I'm pretty sure that if COVID didn't devastate the people who were already struggling (and pretty much only the people who were struggling beforehand) we wouldn't be seeing riots. People whose situation could get a lot worse if shit hit the fan don't riot.And if our government and powers at be are smart (and they are), they will keep the protests about race.

The LAST thing they want is a movement like Occupy Wall Street right now.

But have no fear, the Democrats will play their part in the political manipulation. They will do their political grandstanding about how racist this country is ,BLM and all the rest of it. It's not about economic divides. It's those RACIST COPS and Trump supporters!I bet once  a viable vaccine is \[readily\] available, plenty of tensions will start cooling off though because covid-19 has significantly more downward force, by far, than any of the other current issues.More like a million civilians, but who’s counting>Terrorists are literally no threat to Americans

>Terrorists are a literal Boogie man to scare the American public

I don't think the word "literally" means what you think it means.You're more likely to be killed by a toddler than an Islamic terrorist. Domestic terrorists (you know, right wing incel mass shooter types) are a far greater threat.I can see terrorist groups get affected by COVID as well and at the moment, they are probably more occupied with how China is treating the Muslim minorities in China rather than US.

US has not had any provocative actions to terrorist groups in years. China on the other hand ...> Terrorists are literally no threat to Americans

Domestic terrorism (usually done by a white supremacist) has been steadily on the rise, even the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/confronting-white-supremacy) mentions it. What the fuck, stop downplaying the issue you piece of shit.That's what Andrew Yang has been saying the cause is a mindset of scarcity. If everyone is doing well economically, we're less racists, prejudice and more  tolerant.Even you don't believe the things you wroteThey're not calling the protests "riots," they're calling the riots "riots"Ok, I forgot to count the trust fund kids. I was thinking of looting and vandalism at first.I agree.  Cuts are coming with my employer (financial sector & IT).The eviction moratorium in most states has been extended still many months in the future, and a decent number of states have extended uneployment insurance also by a decent few weeks from today.

But the feds probably won't continue to do the $600 extra from what I gather.Evictions ain't happening. The is a big myth. Most states have quite progressive tenants laws now. Evicting was hard BEFORE Covid-19. Now with hall the moratoriums, and sympathetic courts, I really don't see this big eviction crisis everyone keeps beating the drum about.

I think we are getting close to just opening things back up. The steps we are taking are getting pointless. Tons of people not wearing masks, not social distancing, etc... I mean, why close everything down if people wont follow the rules anyways?

I think the mask rules will stay in place for a long time, but this country is going to have to  bite the bullet and let businesses re-open. There will be no "perfect" all clear to signal a "safe" re-open.Half of employment is small businesses, if half of people go bust were all fucked this guy is a moron.Sadly in this context they are “bit players.” Otherwise they would be the ones receiving the bulk of PPP instead of any going to publicly traded companies.Yet, here we are.I believe he’s  talking about the employees at these small businesses. Not taking away their hard work and motivation, but yes, they are bit players.Seriously. Low and middle income people are the biggest players in the economy since they don't spend that much less than high earners but make up a far, far larger proportion of the population. This guy is a total idiot.Yeah but they can always come back when shit gets to normalIt’s not all lay-off’s either. My company gave everyone a 15% pay cut in order to stay afloat. While I realize I’m very lucky to still have a job, it still has a big impact. Also adding onto this they gave no timeframe on when salaries would be back to normal, my fear is that even when/if they get through this they are going to try to milk the lower salaries for as long as possible.Those at the top are too high above the clouds to see or care about what is happening down below. Not until it affects them.Except Bezos gets Covid and he will just work from home still. Very little interruption.Why would we have an economic issue if Bezos gets sick? I think Amazon is such a behemoth at this point it could operate perfectly fine without Bezos. There's probably a team there determining which sectors and industries to dominate next.> Unemployment is up, but as a percentage of our economy we’re talking margin of error.

This makes no sense.  
 
A booming economy is 5% unemployment rate.   A terrible recession is 10% unemployment rate.   Today we have a 11.1% unemployment rate.   For most of us, that is the highest unemployment we will see in our lifetime.  
  
Lots of waiters earn over US median household income ($60k).   They aren't all poor.  
  
People are confused because we are so EARLY in the recession.   There will be enormous waves of white collar layoffs, as companies feel the effects of the economic problems.   
  
Small businesses for the past few months had the federal government paying their employee salaries.   That is about to end, so the true unemployment rate is obfuscated by zombie jobs.Lol, what?

Do you really think Amazon just ceases to function when Bezos is sick?>Bezos gets covid and we’re in a recession. He’s worth more than about half the country combined.

That's not how worth works for the ultra rich.  Bezos only loses his wealth if amazon goes up in steam, and all those working individuals \*are\* amazon.  Amazon only goes up in smoke when the workers at amazon can't do their job anymore, which they largely have been able to.

That people  are still working is a sign the economy is still alright.  

It won't be once the foreclosures start, but for now it's running.Economic impact is so little? This country is in for a very rude awakening.Bezos is really worth over half the country?Bezos could drop dead right now and Amazon would be fine (after maybe a brief stock price panic). He’s already built the machine. It runs extremely well. No doubt he has some ideas on how to further grow the company, but he’s probably told his higher ups and no doubt someone else at Amazon also has plans. Economy wouldn’t even feel it.Retail, real estate, education, manufacturing are all taking huge hits from this. This is not "margin of error." Do you seriously think software devs and engineers won't be laid off if these sectors plummet? There would be less demand for their services, so there would be layoffs. This is already happening, and it's going to get worse as the virus gets worse.Your submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

In my mind, seems like they rushed out a trillion dollar band-aid that did nothing to change our long term issues. COVID is still surging, there’s been no national plan of action, interests rates are at all-time lows and benefits/deferrals are about done.I think *you'd* be surprised.Ok, but let's set a definition for you being right, first.Of course it’s not “priced in” and that talk is kinda silly to me — to me, that’s just people trying to mask their insecurities with fake, smarmy confidence, looking for the illusion of control. If people read the news instead of just followed their gut, they’d know we have multiple documented cases of people who have gotten COVID twice already. Antibodies wear off in months, the virus can mutate just like the flu. There’s no guarantee a vaccine will be the magic bullet. There’s only so much hay you can throw on the horse.What do you mean? Why couldn't they just extended it after, or reiterate it?I'm a type 1 diabetic, diagnosed 14 years ago. When I was diagnosed I was told, "Don't worry, a cure is just 10 years away!" Well, fourteen years on and a cure is still just ten years away.

I will say however, advances in technology within those ten years have meant my longterm complications will likely drop to near zero over my lifetime thanks to better monitoring and control. My gut feeling is that's where we'll get with COVID. No cure, but great management with no long term impacts. Maybe a COVID season like we have flu season, which is tragic on an individual level, but again, almost entirely manageable for a society as a wholeI develop drugs for a living. I completely agree people are overly optimistic. Even if we do get a vaccine approved in 2020 or 2021, there is no way I’m taking it. Typical development is 5-10 years; it’s physically impossible to asses safety in a 1-2 year timespan.

Especially in regards to Moderna’s mRNA vaccine. It is insane to me how many people are willing to inject themselves with foreign mRNA without understanding the risks and consequences.“But maybe if we just hope hard enough....” 

Like, yes I know there will be a lot of red-tape cutting because it’s covid, but vaccines still take, on avg, [10-15 years to develop. ](https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/vaccine-development-testing-and-regulation)The other issue is compliance. Wearing masks turned into a nationwide culture war, with some people getting killed over it. Assuming the vaccine works as expected (big if) we may not achieve herd immunity because not enough people will take. Ironically there will be those too uneducated to trust vaccines but also those educated enough to know the risks of a fast-tracked vaccineThere is optimism because of the scientific data, not in spite of it.[removed]Are you kidding me? Google it. It's been everywhere in the newsRollout could be laterThis is untrue, fortunately. The scientific community, detached from the media, is increasingly optimistic.> The latest viral strain of the coronavirus has already mutated so much that it is already very different from the February strain.

Not really.  The vaccines depend on the spije protein on the virus.  That has not changed through mutation or any other means.  The vaccines look very promising and there are many candidates.  I'm sure a few of them will fall flat on their face, but we don't need every single one to work to get a vaccine.  We just need 1 of them to work.  Ideally, we'd have at least 2-3 work so that we could significantly increase the speed at which people could get vaccinated.Do you have a source that definitively proves this and shows that the mutations will cause vaccines currently under development to be ineffective?Also there will be a huge gap between creating/discovering the viable vaccine, and then mass producing and distributing that vaccine. Could be another 3-6 month gap until vulnerable populations are vaccinated.Won't be a vaccine, but something to help you fight the virus off, or to give you a better chance when you get it. More like a defensive boostThe media doesn't report the false optimism to keep everyone's hopes up, it's to boost ratings. Same with all the negativity. It's getting to be so blatant, the for-profit sensationalism. On days the deaths are low they report the total infected, and visa versa when the deaths are high to keep the doom and gloom status quo. They then sprinkle in vaccine optimism for added entertainment value.* https://www.wsj.com/articles/pfizer-biontech-get-1-95-billion-covid-19-vaccine-order-from-u-s-government-11595418221?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=17

The stale thing would be going around in circles arguing with another person's imagined future not matching your imagined future.It’s so easy. Just get out before the crash. Fool proof.But if there is hyper inflation, you will want to stay in the market in solid companiesyeah everyone throws a different prediction, one of them is bound to be right soThe calm before the storm.ok u/jizz_on_her_faceIf Trump can be a President. I can be anything.I .. DECLARE .. RECESSIONRemindMe! 6 monthsRemindMe! 2032He made a statement. The burden of proof is on him.

Are you saying rich people will sell stocks for food? They won't sell anything and the economy will catch up eventually.What if there's nothing else to pick ? Chinese yuan or Luckin Coffee Stock coupon ? Good luck with that ...Like what, the Euro? How about a Russian Ruble? Maybe even the Yuan. Point is all the alternatives are much less trust worthy compared the the USD, and we have the big stick to back it up.why would countries default as we print more money and our interest rates approach 0?Would it turn the US into king of exports though?Eh, no one can call the US out on its credit limit. For one thing, everyone is also printing money. And we’re just replacing lost income temporarily so core inflation doesn’t seem too big a risk. It feels like the fed pretty much handled it at the expense of savers holding cash and not assetsI don’t think that limit will be hit any time soonNo one will believe this until we enter another major crisislol, as if the fed is ever going to be able to raise interest rates. these are here to stay, brother.Hold up. 

The mantra of this sub for the last 5 months has been "the stock market is not the economy." The argument has always been that yeah the economy is terrible but it doesn't matter because it's all temporary bc of the virus. Now *you're* the one confusing the stock market for the economy. 

There was NOT a v shaped recovery. The economy is still in the shitter. The *market* might have recovered quickly, but those two aren't the same thing. Right? That's what all the bulls keep saying...the bears are spot on about main street. it’s hell for common people. 

it just so happens that wall street continues to function. wild stuff.No eventually they'll be right, and will let you know when that happens.  The real issue here is not who's right and who's wrong.  The entire point is making money.  So when all is said and done, all you have to do is compare performance to see who "won".I don't get why it always boils down to a Bears VS Bulls fight with some of you people. 

Do you literally know nothing about economics? Does the state of the economy and the current situation with coronavirus really scream to you that the US stock market should be near ATHs?"Not wrong just early" (something I've read by bears on this sub this year, last year and 5 years ago.)It won't go up in perpetuity. Surely you realize that? At some point they will be right. The question is when and the answer is no one knows for sure. But it wouldn't hurt to hedge a bit in my opinion.In fire management, there's a core understanding that you can have many small fires or a large catastrophic fire. I'm old enough to remember that the economics bailouts of 2008 led to the euro zone crisis.

Fire and wall street panic have a lot of similarities.Remindme! 3 monthsRemindme!  2 YearsThis thread is strange to me. Thanks to Tech, Amazon, Tesla etc my portfolio has been lookong great. If you bought the dip in March, you should have made money. How on earth is OP comparing this to 2008?And impatient bulls are too quick to say we're over the worst of it. Still in the first wave of covid-19 during the summer and the numbers continue to skyrocket. The party just started as far as I'm concerned.It's infuriating just how toxic and persistent the hive mind of this sub can be.  It's like any and all challenges to the accepted dogma need to be ridiculed and torn down.The 10 bagger growth from 1929 was all a lie. We should be driving Model As stillWe are still in the tulipmania bubble, just you waitMaybe they’ll want to bail out the ol’ US of A by paying some taxes? Nah, they’ll do stock buybacks and distribute dividends to themselves until our last infrastructure week.Corporations are getting loans, which they will have to pay back *unless* they use the money for employees.Aka "the bag Holder"It’s not even rich people as much as huge swaths of industries. My business relies on tourism, so I’m screwed, but lots of my friends haven’t been impacted at all. They might be working from home, but few layoffs in:

Health care
Education 
Government
Banking/financials 

Pretty much everyone with an office job is fine. (Not even tech. Think telcos, the gas companies etc.)

I think that’s why it does seem different than 2008. Some businesses are thriving due to the shutdowns. What was a safe haven industry in 2008? Bankruptcy law?Let me tell you about 1913 and when the federal reserve was created by Illuminati rising down from the sky on their flying Tyrannosaurus rexs.  Our economy has been propped up by alien invaders since then manipulating our economy and thoughts.  

Wake up sheeple. Buy gold and bitcoin.Yep. Went from mortgage backed securities to rent backed securities. Housing still super inflated.

And to your point, that might be 5X worse doing it during a pandemic.> We have breached the 90% level, we don’t want to be adding and adding to that for low ROI public spending, that will only compound the crisis

In fairness, Growth in a Time of Debt has had a hard few years. Your economist link from 2013 is covering the whole excel/aggregation error controversyIn fairness, the US hasn't been hit as hard economically as most other countries. Europe GDP projections contracted -7.5%, Canada -6.2%, UK -6.5%, the US is currently only projected to be about -5.9%... These are all imf numbers.

I don't think there was a way to really avoid damage, even if your country handled it better, we're too connected to not feel the impact economically. You mention New Zealand, but their GDP is projected to slide -7.2% for 2020. Singapore was applauded for their reaction, but their GDP is projected to slide -4 to -7%. I can't find South Korea's 2020 projections, but they've also just entered into a recession anyway and they're the ones that handled this the best.I just wish I knew what to do with my money.

I could see this totally stalling out if the Dems are unwilling to budge on McConnell's business liability protections, for example."Socialism = Death" reads the sign of an elderly tea partier enjoying benefits from Social Security and Medicare.Actually not true. Theres less deaths now due to less auto accidents or any death that could result from people being outside. Less people are dying covid-era than pre covid/r/confidentlyincorrect.

The recession started way before Obama's first term in 2009, officially lasting from December 2007 to June 2009 per the standard economist definition (two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP growth), with its effects lingering for a few years into Obama's term.  Things were already looking bad in late 2007, prompting George W. Bush to sign the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 into law in February 2008.  Things worsened when Bear Stearns collapsed in March 2008, which was enormous news at the time, and prompted an emergency loan from the Fed. Lehman collapsed in September 2008, which prompted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 creating the $700B TARP program.  That act was signed into law by president George W. Bush in early October 2008.  Obama's first term began in January 2009.

So far I've found about 10 of them. Each one wildly upvoted because *of course* the much promised doom and gloom was going to be here in 1, 2, or 3 months each time. Of course...interestingly...none of those people ever followed up. I've even messaged them asking them where the doom was to no response! I'll add you to the list :)I mean the Fed actually did raise rates several times - and debt service ratios didn't budge. Of course if you raise interest rates enough you'll get adverse effects. But you have to examine the chance of that happening (zero) and whether its good policy for it to happen (it isn't). So they can keep printing infinite money and no worries.



*right* > If you don’t think record stock indexes, low unemployment, low inflation and low interest rates is representative of a a great economy then I don’t know what fantasy world you’re living in.


 People were saying the same thing in 2006. That's why speculative bubbles are so damned attractive.Depends on the state.  Many will have another week.I'm only 1 FEMA scandal away from a bingo, fingers crossed.Cascadia subduction zone earthquake would do it too.George Bush doesn’t care about black peopleYeah I just need natural disaster to complete my “wtf” bingo for 2020I'm holding an alien invasionThe dam is in China how can it affect events here in the States ? The dam should break and wash China to sea for all I care.Bloody Mormons..I guarantee that there will be no vaccine.Recessions take a while to hit people, outside of the people directly affected by the initial wave. In 2008, the people directly affected were anyone real estate/banking related. In 2020, the people directly affected were anyone restaurant/bar/entertainment related.Your dad May have fucked your mom one year, but you weren’t born until the following year. Crazy how that happensI agree with you partly but Portland has shown that many all over the spectrum have gathered to protestIt has been nowhere near a million (under 300-400k combined) that number is sheer propaganda and no better than Trump's lies.  The Iraq body count project and the UN both have been counting.

[https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/02/1057921](https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/02/1057921)Yeah I apologize,  it's a bad habit lolThat's a good point, but I wonder if they'll react the same way in China, completely different society over there. Stricter security as well.  Never really considered the persecution of the Uighurs, is China going to invade the Middle East next?Cmon man, he called that out in his comment. White ppl are never classified as terrorists in the media/by politicians, they're just called "unstable". The parent comment specifically referenced "Islamic terrorism".https://www.amazon.com/Terror-Factory-Inside-Manufactured-Terrorism/dp/1935439618

finding no terrorist cells (in whichever group) means no promotion.Maybe stop invading their homelands you scumbag foreignerManagement at my company just said to expect a very tough 2021 even though the shutdown itself didn’t affect our revenue at all. Some of our main clients are municipal governments and many of them are facing budgetary issues.there is a bank or two (globally) that are going under next year, it takes awhile to sniff out things like lehman brother, bernie madoff or enron but you can't ever say we had a financial crisis without examples like those popping upOkay, so there won't be evictions where everyone lives, just landlords declaring bankruptcy. Everyone remain calm! This is fine for the economy!I'm so sorry. Tenants that aren't paying rent will not be evicted. Economy is saved. You're so pedantic you've missed the entire boat on what the end of the 600/wk will do to the economyIts just not as quick to happen and with the unemployment benefits the impact to the economy has been muted.  
It takes a while for that chunk of the population to stop spending, takes a while for that reduction in spending to impact big companies bottom lines, and the market seems to be both short sighted (high frequency econ data reaction) and super long (2021 earnings don't matter?).Half of employment is small business, but it doesn't come close to half the economy.The reason they're not receiving the bulk of PPP has little to do with their actual economic impact.

It's more to do with lawyers getting in the paperwork faster, lobbyists helping craft the bill in the first place, and banks having a preference for their larger clients or other biases.They did get most of PPP. Publicly traded companies only netted a tiny percentage. I agree PPP was not appropriately tailored, but the worst offenders are smallish employers in professional services (investment firms, lawyers, accountants, etc.) who did fine and had most of their payroll covered anyhow. Would have been better to make the loans 0 interest and forgive based on net revenue declines or something similar.So by your rationale, you are arguing that Congress always allocates funding appropriately?  The fuck outta here.What publicly traded company received ppp loans?Or they’re doing it wrong....Yep, it's always best to stay in touch and not feel like you're somehow above all this because you're definitely not unless you're maybe an executive or influential leader. Don't push luck.

 Pay cuts sound terrible. My company stopped matching for 401ks a few months ago, and I thought that was bad.They didnt do it to stay afloat, they did it because they could get away with it. Its a textbook result in recessions oversaturating the labor market. Same thing happened in the great depression[removed]And it did for several months while Bezos was on vacation.  He has an excellent leadership team.  [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) and AWS have actual divisional CEOs that are wholly responsible for running them.

Amazon could run itself.  Bezos sets the principles and values from the top and arbitrates strategic decisions.  One of those values that he like to talk about is Customer Obsession, which guides every decision.  This is why amazon has such excellent customer service, such a great return policy, why their products are so damn cheap, why we get 1-day delivery, and... why warehouse workers get paid so little.The majority of items on Amazon is Chinese garbage.



Amazon could be in big trouble if things continue to heat up; as would every peddler of Chinese crap.A team? Try tens of thousands of teams[Yeah, some people would argue that Amazon looks at their customers data to find their next products.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23929044)This is the right answer. It doesn’t seem that bad because no one has come to collect the checks yet. Student loans are still in forbearance, the fed gov is still supplementing unemployment, etc. 

And we haven’t even seen the obvious and inevitable second covid spike that comes during flu season (this is to say -nothing- if there happens to be a natural disaster like a hurricane in, say, Florida with its already extremely high infection rate).  

We know there’s income inequality greater now than since before the Great Depression but I’m telling you things are going to get a lot worse and sooner than we think. There are going to be a lot of people living out of their cars.[removed]$60k is really nothing in terms of the economy unless you ignore income inequality.

Also keep in mind: that's just income, not net worth which is even more extreme.  The actual amount of money controlled by someone earning <$100k is peanuts in our economy today.  And what those people do have, they don't even control. It's mostly sitting in investments like 401(k)'s which are controlled by the a handful of fund managers.  Or sitting in assets like homes.

The amount of money the average person contributes to the economy today is insanely small.

The economic impact of the bottom 50% of Americans is at this point pretty much insignificant. They own so little it doesn't really register.

Go back 30 years, and the bottom 50% absolutely had an impact.Wait Bezos doesn’t ship out all those packages by himself?It would create a lot of panic.  He's essentially what Steve Jobs was to Apple, and similar to Tom Hanks, his getting sick would make a lot of people pause.

Don't have to like it, but the reality is, that would have a measurable impact on the economy.  His demise would as well. Big questions would come up about leadership, splitting up the company (and the precedent that could set for other tech companies like Google and Microsoft) which would have material impacts on NASDAQ.

Also keep in mind his ex-wife joined the Giving Pledge to give most of her wealth away.  Jeff's a notable holdout. Nobody besides him and his lawyers have any idea what that money will do when he's gone or where it goes.  Could be a mega charity, could be a mega investment firm in his name run by someone not publicly named yet. Or both.

Edit: Ex-wife.Expand on that?The median savings in the US is about $5,000. Its not that hard to believe.Not that surprising when you think about it. If you have 1 cent, you are worth more than roughly 20% of the country who have negative networth. Followed by a lot of people with barely any assets. Doesn't take much.Feds can't exactly solve the virus, but they can provide short-term liquidity which will keep employers afloat until someone else does. If hospitality and retail had a huge string of bankruptcies and closures unemployment would be much higher and recovery would wind up taking significantly longer. So yes, I would say the financial response to the recession was significantly better than the last one (although far from perfect).

Now the Federal government's response to COVID itself is *far* from as well executed but I'll leave that for another sub.If those people weren't economically relevant, then you should probably tell everyone over on /r/landlord to shut the fuck up, because their tenants' missed rent payments are not economically significant. Landlords are LOSING THEIR MINDS claiming the nonpayment of rent and the inability to evict is an absolute calamity and their are now RUINED financially.

You can tell them "Don't worry, none of that unpaid rent has an actual impact on the economy :D"They end this weekend, needs to be done todayI'm also in drug development, and agree people are being too optimistic, but why wouldn't you want to take Oxford's Ad vector vaccine? I understand the Moderna skepticism completely, even though mRNA theoretically should be pretty safe.

I think I'd be willing to get an inactivated viral vaccine or an Ad vector vaccine even with an accelerated timeline. Moderna as a company sketches me out though. They need that 5-10 year development timeline.I also am in drug dev and I don't really see a mechanism for long term side effects of an mRNA injection that wouldn't also be present in the actual viral infection. Maybe the engineered lipids in the capsid but again it's cleared so quickly and is pretty similar to native vesicles. Most bad vaccine ADEs have been adjuvant related or because they were live attenuated (ex polio vac). Not saying you're unreasonable to be cautious but I don't think that getting infected is less uncertain, especially because you're getting the foreign mRNA anyway.

Edit: for an example of corollary long term effects, there's some compelling evidence that the autoimmune issues seen in the wake of h1n1 vaccine campaigns occur after h1n1 infection as well.I'm in Canada and I think we'll have the luxury of letting other people guinea pig the vaccene before it becomes a problem here, so I'm on board with not taking this until you need to. BUT with that said, if I was in the US I'd probably be wondering whats riskier. Covid or a half tested vaccine.

Everything I've read about mRNA is that it will be a far safer method then the old ones (in theory, being its a new technology).  You might be better off gambling with this tech then the more traditional shots.Or just contract covid like me and get natural antibodiesJust because you operate a plate reader doing HTS to pay your mortgage doesn't make you an expert on vaccine safety: the two things are pretty unrelated.    We can get a pretty good idea of a vaccine's safety in the time span we have.   If a vaccine doesn't cause acute effects on injection (existing phase I studies with the COVID vaccines have shown that these are not too bad), and there's no evidence that antibody-dependent enhancement is occurring in COVID (if this was occurring, wouldn't convalescent serum worsen the disease symptoms, and aren't strong antibody-dependent enhancement effects more of a flavivirus thing anyway), what risks could be foreseen?  

I am getting the vaccine as soon as I can.This is dangerous nonsense to be putting on a public forum. With people like you,  even if we have a vaccine, we still have a problem as you will discourage the vulnerable from getting it. These vaccines are going through the very same safety testing as any other would, but you should know that since you say you work in pharma. If they make it through phase three testing, which is far from guaranteed right now, they are safe. The reason most vaccines take longer is because they receive a small fraction of the financial backing that covid vaccines currently in development do.Considering the way people like Fauci have been acting (literally lying to the public about masks for "the greater good"), I personally wouldn't put it past them to push a mandatory vaccination. I realize there is a lot of conspiracy theories going around right now, but I'm not talking about that, I'm just talking about simple hubris.

I feel like the public would go along with almost anything at this point just to get the economy back open, which is exactly my problem because that is a huge conflict of interest. We have people in power who I'm sure **literally** get high off playing the role of "savior" and are giddy at the prospect of forcing something on the public. These are unfortunately the same kind of people who don't take shutting down the economy seriously because they don't think there are any real consequences of having the central bank print money to cover the costs. It is a huge conflict of interest.Phase 2 trials are not a reason to be overly optimistic. It's subjective, but to many people very little optimism is warranted. There's no evidence of longterm efficacy yet, and no guarantee they won't cause serious harm to a large percentage of people who take it.

There are plenty of good reasons these trials usually take a decade and it's not for lack of funds or willpowerYour submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*Do we have a source that proves that a majority of the population will take the vaccine. A poll recently showed 44% of republicans believe Bill Gate's vaccine is a conspiracy to microchip us. So if 60-70% of the population is vaccinated is that enough to achieve herd immunity?Do you have a source that any of the vaccines are not already ineffective?I think production will be very fast. Never in our history have we had the entire planet focused on producing one single product.Candidate vaccines are already being mass produced as we speak in preparation for the green light.You realize governments are giving these companies grants to begin mass producing the vaccines months before they complete phase 3 trials.  There will be hundreds of millions of doses produced by the time they complete phase 3 trials.It would be dangerous for someone to make allocation changes based on looking at individual sectors of the economy. But I didn’t suggest doing that. I was just pointing out specific sector differences between early in 2008 recession and 2020 recession.> Coming back later to see how well it aged is the only way to do it. 

Why?

Also, if it's actually that important then man up and make you're own counter prediction as well.And then just buy again when the market reaches its trough. I don’t know why more people don’t try this strategy.A broken clock is right twice a day.[deleted]They were saying this every year from like 2010-2015. I’ll believe it when I see it.Yeah the next leg down is coming.... any day now...It's very possible. We might see the true consequences of this in a year from now. Huge amount of small businesses dying, unsustainable debt, banks going down, markets collapsing. Very weak Dollar, which is already showing in the insane rise in precious metals. I'm scared, I really am.This sub has been saying this for 5 years nowWhy are you booing him, hes right!r/unexpectedofficeRemindMe! 8 MonthsRemindMe! 6 monthsYou can't really argue a prediction into happening. It'll either age well, which means that everyone going "WELL PROVE IT" will look stupid in hindsight or it'll age badly, which means they'll look appropriately sceptical.

People will act according to their predictions and time'll tell who was on the right track.There shouldn't be a single, nationalized reserve currency.  That's... sort of the point of all of this.  It will be a basket of many currencies, including cryptocurrencies like BTC and AMPL.Not me personally, but there's speculation that reverting back to gold standard is a possibility, and with the recent surge in precious metals and gold/silver leading the pack, we're starting to see market indicators aligning with that narrative.CryptoBecause we devalue the currency, but their debt level remains the same.  Their dollars no longer service the debt like it did before the printing, but the amount of the debt is the same, and they're not getting any of the fresh print.

Now, there's discussion that the Fed will open dollar swap lines, but of course those can only do so much.  If you are a country with dollar debt and need dollars through the swap line, you are still going to have to print a bunch of your own failing currency (that's not in demand like the dollar is and the printing of which will cripple your own domestic economy just to pay down USD debt).

So the more we print, the more it breaks the back of these countries. Even if we open swap lines, they still get a raw deal.  The DXY is going to spike and these countries will default, ditch the dollar, and never look back.  It would be the rational thing to do.Exactly. Those cattier battle groups aren’t just for strictly military means. 

Power projection, trade protection, etc all enable the US to essentially do what it wants (in the medium term). They could definitely do enough damage to themselves to lose that top position, but that’s highly unlikelyAnd inflation isn't generally that big of an issue unless the money isn't being spent.Surely at some point institutions will stop buying bonds, no? Less than 1% for 10 years already seems insane.OPEC can and will. Russia already wants to end the ties of oil to the USD.

If that happens, the economic destruction will be MUCH worse than any recession we would have if the fed backed off right now.Parent comment said "The market ", which I assume refers to the stock market?When the government is by and for the oligarchy, you can be sure the corporate socialism will continue as long as they can get away with it.>No eventually they'll be right

Yeah, you can say "market's gonna crash" every day for 20 years and then when it does scream "I TOLD YOU SO!" completely ignoring the 20 consecutive years that you were wrong. This sums up all market commentary.> The real issue here is not who's right and who's wrong. The entire point is making money. 

So the people who were buying in March and April were right and the people who were acting as if it was the apocalypse and anyone who was buying was an idiot because the market was going lower were wrong.  The people who have been bearish the whole time are wrong. This whole "ILL BE RIGHT EVENTUALLY" or "NOT WRONG, JUST EARLY" (and you can never be wrong, because it's always early) stuff is nonsense. "Oh, I missed this unbelievable muti-month rally that saw some growth funds up 50-60+% YTD and the S & P have the biggest 50 day rally in its history, but eventually I'll be right and the market will go down." Be flexible. People take such absurd pride in being "contrarian" and *completely* wrong - a large portion of this sub seems to think it's Michael Burry  - and missing a massive multi-month rally because you're a stubborn pessimist isn't something to be proud of.The stock market is just one big bull market. 

And let’s say, this is it. 

100 years of shit. 

Then, oh fucking well. 

There is nothing we can do. 

I have a feeling it’s not though. 

If you’re *investing*, just keep putting money in the market. If it goes down, double down. 

Pretend it’s like a sale at your favorite store and you got a gift card. 

If it goes up, nothing to worry about, enjoy your ride to the top. 

Just don’t pull out and sit on the sidelines. 

If you’re *gambling*, go to WSB.They’re already right. USD is falling into the shitter with rates already there and precious metals flying. This is not ending well.The market makes a lot more sense if you look at it by sector. 

Finance, industry, energy and small caps are still badly beaten down since they are more cyclical and better reflect the state of the economy.

Staples and healthcare have recovered since these are essentials and they'll be needed and profitable no matter the state of the economy.

Tech has made new ATH's due to an increased reliance on stay-at-home tech in order to keep things functioning. I can't say much for why stocks like TSLA are booming, but AMZN, ZM, MSFT soaring makes sense when their profits and future growth prospects have also improved.Considering the amount of stimulus and PPP loan money that has certainly found its way into the market by people/companies that didn't really need it, it's not shocking. It's all a house of cards though.>Does the state of the economy and the current situation with coronavirus really scream to you that the US stock market should be near ATHs?

Honestly, maybe.  Keep in mind that "the US stock market" typically refers to indices of large companies like the S&P 500 or the DJIA.  The crisis might kill the local book store down the street, but it probably won't kill Amazon.  Guess which company is part of the S&P 500.  

If the crisis kills small businesses and spending is diverted to the large businesses that comprise the stock market indices people focus on, that would justifiably push market valuations to all time highs.

Long story short, there is a ton of uncertainty out there.  One can make a real argument for future price increases just as easily as one can make an argument for future price drops.  If this was as simple as you think it is, I'd be retired on a beach right now.The market isn't a reflexion of current economy but a projection. When the average investor will lose every hope for a quick fix on coronavirus issue, then you'll get the right picture for the next couple of years.

I'm not a bear nor a bull, but I pray for a smooth decline of the market (to accumulate more) while I still have hope for our lives to come back to "normal" (I'm not for a vaccine, but for governments just to give up - which is an unpopular opinion and I might get downvoted for)The problem is that a lot of people (some members of my family included) pulled their money out during the crash and never got back in due to fear of another crash. As a result, they locked in all the losses and missed out on this rally of unknown length.> But it wouldn't hurt to hedge

I'm a student nearing the end of studying and since march, I have been living with parents as everything stopped(Uni and work) so I went home to keep costs down yet I have been getting paid furlough during this time. I work part-time in a bar and I wouldn't say I am exactly valued in the business, yet they are giving me furlough and from what I have heard all other positions in the bar and its other locations have not let one person go. So if you add that up and the furlough scheme is being given to people like me, honestly I don't need the money but I take it, meanwhile unemployment in professional jobs in the same city is quite high and the same for people who cannot afford to pay their housing costs. It seems to me that the scheme is being used for the wrong people!

Add in the fact that we are about to get absolutely annihilated once the flu season starts up and all the folk who have been on holiday abroad come home. Then in terms of academia, the sudden influx of domestic students from all over the UK to the cities. We are setting it up for another lockdown but the Furlough scheme is not going to be used next time as its not feasible.

One of the checks against though, is that the Central Asian republics which actually have ethnic ties with Uighurs are much more stable than ME countries.

People have some misconception about how evictions work. Like I can just goto the court house and file an Unlawful Detainer, and poof they are gone.

Even PRE-Covid19, evictions that you would think are slam dunk cases can take MONTHS, and thousands of dollars and legal expenses while you fight the tenant. In many cases, you end up PAYING the tenant to leave, even though they are 100% in the wrong!

Most big cities have passed moratoriums on evictions that are going to last a while. Even when those expire, the courts (which were already biased towards tenants), will slow things down even more.the us is barely getting any benefits compared to Canada lolSpecially if they earn more money unemployed. Look it up, people have spent MORE with the benefits. When they stop suckling at the states tit is when things will get ugly, or market crashes or dollar crashes. 

It's like that 3 Gorges Dam, you can stick a finger in the hole but it creates pressure elsewhere. Something will have to give.How much consumer spending comes from those employees?
Once they spend those dollars how far down the economic chain does that money flow.
If a lady at the nail shop loses her gig cause her store closed her local sandwhich shop gets hosed from selling less sandwhiches, her pay roll company takes a hit, the eletric company looses revenue, her nail polish company, the shippers and trucking etc etc etc. 
consumer spending is 70 gad damn percent of the US economy lets not pretend is the labor market goes tits up that its not going to do anything.If half of the consumers are small business workers, then eventually those people aren't going to have money to spend. Doesn't that money eventually work it's way up the chain? 

I think your comment does not acknowledge the very real connection between consumers and "the economy".That's not true.  Small business makes up 44% of US GDP.

I was trying to allude to the fact small businesses largely didn’t receive any help. The 3 to 10 employee mom and pops, than pay rent for their space and equipment, and are vital to most communities. These are the ones shutting down permanently because they received little to no help.Sir this is Reddit.It looks like close to 40 reported receiving loans. Some of the companies gave them back but only after they got called out publicly. I think Ashford Hospitality Trust was the largest of them.

This is nonsense.

I the bottom 50% didn't mean anything, then those extra 5% of unemployed last recession wouldn't have registered.  
  
Those people earning under $60k still spend money in the economy, create jobs, and contribute to much wealthier people.Looks like someone is confusing the economy with the stock market.  News flash: those are two entirely different things!This is Apple's net income since 2005.

Can you show me where Jobs' death hurth the company?

I don't disagree that Bezos' death would cause chaos among Amazon's leadership. I just don't think it would have an impact on their bottom line, at least in the short-term.For one segment, evictions and foreclosures have been prohibited by law. Once states allow those again the flood will begin. Banks and landlords aren't going to let people never pay rent or pay the mortgage. Hundreds of thousands of foreclosures are sitting on the sidelines ready to file when the emergency orders are liftedI think that's the average amount in savings accounts. I have $5,000 in a savings and $20,000 in checking so I would technically show up as having only $5,000 in savings as well.Yeah that doesn't make it betterI am a landlord. I rent to people who are servers in the restaurant industry. They've paid their rent on time every month.Thank you, I'm not an American. If it ends today, they could get it done for Monday really? It's an arbitrary deadline, no? As long as it gets done sooner than laterIf I were in a high risk group, I would take the Oxford vaccine over Moderna no doubt. However, I’m not high risk so I’d honestly rather contract the virus and develop the antibodies myself. People have different opinions and that’s fine.For a few months... Are you back to 100%?I personally manage $5 million in research contracts specifically for the development of respiratory drugs but you, a random on the internet, knows more than me. Okay bro.I’m all in favor of swift and generalized vaccination, but just passing phase 3 doesn’t guarantee safety. We’ve had very unfortunate examples of drugs whose long-term toxicity got revealed well into the pharmacovigilance phase (phase 4).There’s no legal basis to do so but that won’t stop certain groups advocating for that approach. The irony of advocating for these mandatory measures in a time of increased awareness of police brutality is not lost on me.I didn't say I was **overly** optimistic. Yes, in the past vaccine development has taken a long time, and yes, there is bound to be a limited amount of extra risk because of the timelines here. That said though, and as someone else in the comments mentioned, never before has the entire world been so focused on solving a single problem. There's a first time for everything. There are also several promising candidates, at least one of which (ChAdOx) are based on existing vaccines which have significant clinical histories. Time will tell of course, but I see more reasons to be optimistic than pessimistic right now.This is a much better question than the nonsense I initially responded to.Dumbest comment in the chain award goes to...Too bad we never beat polio and smallpox.Agreed. Everyone says "well the fastest vaccine ever, mumps, took four years" without taking into account that that was 50 years ago, and I don't think the mumps pandemic was nearly this bad where practically every pharmaceutical research company was throwing practically everything they had at it.[deleted]>Never in our history have we had the entire planet focused on producing one single product.

The largest non-war effort in history by multiple magnitudes.Never in our history has there been a corona virus vaccine.My fault. I was reading too fast. You’re right I agree.> 
Also, if it's actually that important then man up and make you're own counter prediction as well.

Every country that's been economically sanctioned understand they need to get out of the USD denominated system.

By weaponizing the dollar under Obama and then used without descretion under Trump means that every country understand the risk associated with a continual USD dominance now. We've seeded the destruction of our greatest asset, and it will only take time for countries to react accordingly to their best interest.>You can't speak of this crisis as thought it's already behind us. The economic challenge has hardly even begun and the virus part is still getting worse by the week.

This is talking about the economy itself. It's absolutely true. We are still in recession. Millions of people are losing their jobs. Thousands of people are dying of covid everyday. The economy is in the shitter. That's a fact.

>The market has held up because the gov't is basically paying the bills of the unemployed. That isn't sustainable. I don't know how it ends but it will end somehow. That's the part that will probably be worse than 2008.

This is talking about the disconnect between the market and the economy. The only reason the stock market is doing well is because the Fed took unprecedented bold action to backstop the bond market. Also Congress managed to pass 2 relief bills and are working on a third. This virus isn't going away any time soon. A vaccine by EOY is an unrealistic pipe dream.

\- Don TrumpYou're right in a macro sense. If I had 100 years not just to live but enjoy that money i would be investing differently. But, I want my gains to be higher threshold so I can enjoy the money. Not that I'm not enjoying playing the markets, but I hate the thinking that you're not risking anything. Whether at wsb or putting money in CDs, you're still opening up yourself to risk. If you're strategy is 4-6% until you can retire I guess that's a strategy. Not a smart one in my opinion but we will have different targets.You're a fool if you think any government is essentially going to announce, "Get it over with and just die already," to its citizens.Some of us have put money in the market in march and removed in june. I just don't see the pandemy getting better in october so I prefer to stay back and have some put ready.That's not a hedge, that's not even investing, it's just gambling.

Yeah, as someone who did this I have to agree.  I'm an irrationally risk-averse person and have kept what little IRA savings we have parked in cash since March, waiting for the markets to bottom out.  I feel like such an idiot.

This one will trickle up.Thank you :)I am disputing none of that. I'm so sorry I mentioned evictions. I have gotten so many paragraphs from you people on the nuances of what evictions look like. 

What I meant to say was that millions of Americans are going to have $47 billion less dollars to spend per month so before you go thinking this is better than 2008, wait to see what happens after people can't make their debt obligations.So you’re saying suckling at the state’s tit helps the economyI agree with your point and statement, but people who are accepting unemployment benefits aren't _suckling_ at the state's tit.  It's a fun phrase, just kinda makes people down on their luck sound bad.I can't imagine an economy where people wouldn't pay other people to make them a sandwhich.  whether is for Bitcoin, gold or ammunition, sandwhiches are getting traded.  And whatever currency works best will get used.  Thats Visa right now, and probably my lifetime.  ammo is heavy.I meant the government/Fed (not the small businesses).

My point is that just because the PPP happened, doesn’t mean that money went where it needed to.... but it got where it was intended to go...Ah yeah makes sense. I wish you luck and many future raises :)what did he say?All companies pay cost of labor, which is very different from cost of living.  Labor is stupid cheap and in abundant supply.From what I've heard, the white collars get paid well but are completely overworked leading to higher turnover rates than average.Amazon's benefits for software engineers (white collar) pale in comparison to other top tech companies. Their 401k match is pitiful, the salaries are relatively lower compared to Google, FB, Microsoft, etc. and their RSU vesting schedule is awful (you don't get 80% of it unti your third and fourth years). They're stingy across the board, one of their Leadership Principles is literally "Frugality"....not to mention the Amazon reputation of overworking their white collar employees as well, as the other reply mentioned.Their engineering salaries are not high vs comparable companies.I somewhat agree with the previous commenter's sentiment, but not quite to the same extent. There definitely is a difference between now and '08. A much larger portion of the lower incomes had disproportionate control over larger capital thanks to the poor lending practices of that time. A loss of low income jobs then meant large amounts of mortgages defaulting. Today it means a large amount of missed rental payments. 

That isn't to say we can't reach the same result especially if the higher earners depend on the low income renters to make their payments, but things are slightly more buffered in this way. At least that's how I see things.Eyeballing the tables [here](https://www.bls.gov/cex/2018/combined/decile.pdf) (PDF) it looks like the bottom 50% of 'consumer units' are responsible for a little under 30% of consumer spending. Which in turn is about 70% of GDP. So their spending accounts for about 20% of GDP.

They're not a massive slice of the US economy, but still quite significant. I also agree that there are significant knock-on effects from their plight that are worrisome for the broader economy, like societal instability, strain on the safety net, and belt-tightening by companies in staffing, inventory levels, and investment.Jobs spent a few years sick and grooming an obvious successor. Bezos has made no indication of the same.

Apples and Oranges.Why would you leave that much money in an account that you perform transactions out of? This seems so idiotic.You should probably flip those numbers.Sure but it also doesn't take much. It is a dramatic and misleading way to represent wealth. 

Another equally useless and dramatic way of stating this world be: Every single of the millions of people in the 20th percentile of wealth have more money than the entire bottom 20% of the population.that's an awfully small sample size you got there, friend.

And is that rental income economically significant such that you would notice it disappearing?

are you arguing that these people are not economically relevant or that they are not in an economically precarious situation? because there's a LOT of squawking over on the landlord subreddit about how other tenants that aren't YOUR tenants are NOT paying rent, and it seems your argument shifted from "these people being destitute won't matter" to "these people aren't destitute" and those are completely different statements.It's not really an arbitrary deadline, because those receiving the benefits will stop receiving them immediately once they end. Those people will be up the creek until they come up with a new plan to extend them.No, having different opinions about something like this is not fine when other people's lives are on the line. Why would you rather contract the virus than get vaccinated? I'm surprised to hear this from someone who is actually in the industry.

You're not just getting vaccinated to protect yourself. Mass vaccination is required to achieve herd immunity and nip this thing in the bud. Sure we should try to vaccinate high-risk individuals first, but for long term herd immunity and a complete return to normalcy you should get vaccinated and encourage your peers to do the same.

Plus, getting a vaccine is likely to induce stronger protection than contracting the virus itself (we still don't know if this will be the case. Oxford's IgG neut Ab titers look to be on par with those who were infected).What are your actual credentials, though?  You sound like a dumbass from the way you talk about development timelines.

We're not letting SARS-CoV-2 rage for 5-10 years lolYeah, and we're not talking about a GLP-2 type scenario where chronic administration of a drug with ancillary activity at a different receptor increases cancer risk.   This is a totally different type of therapy.Why would our number be so low?

The biotech companies are already starting production of vaccine candidates and are estimating 300 million in 2020 and a billion in 2021 production.  From a single company.  

Also we aren't vaccinating the entire planet.  The first world will develop it and will definitely give it to their citizens first.  Other countries can either make it themselves or wait.Look we're not aiming to get the entire globe vaccinated.  A few things here, #1 we might have 3,5, 10 proven vaccines by mid-late next year.  #2 there's plenty of capacity to do more than one million per day - doses for vaccines are small.  #3 herd immunity is probably ~60% of the population.  #4 you probably won't have to vaccinate a significant number of people who have already had the virus to reach herd immunity. #5 from an American or European prospective, life returning to normal doesn't need the whole globe vaccinated.

A vaccine will be available in Europe and the US first and will spread out from there.That's exactly the point that I'm makingIt's still really early in the recession. People think they are getting deals now because people need to sell, yet there is plenty of cash to go around, mostly due to the stimulus and unemployment. The cash is slowly going to consolidate to the rich people over the next 6 months and most regular people will be hurting.

It's what me and my family love to do. The number of new boats and jet skis this year is crazy. Friend of mine is looking to buy a new pontoon and there's not many available. People don't have anything to do this summer and there are a bunch of people buying jetskis and boats that have never had one before. 

We sold our old boat last week and it happened so fast. People were coming to look at the boat and wanted to bring a cashier's check with them so they could buy it on the spot.[deleted]Of courseDid you intend this as a reply to my comment?Muh porfolios dropped 40% how come nobody saw this coming?!Your submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

from the original comment and

>This fall/winter isn't going to be pretty.

from yours are exactly what I'm talking about. You keep making predictions about how bad the market is gonna get and how the worst is yet to come the same way bears have always done. Might happen, might not happen, but the fact is that doomsayers have missed out on massive gains and they will never admit they were wrong.This made me lol.

Why anyone listens to that man is beyond me.

Bears need their biases confirmed I guess.Negative, the sungod told me "we gud"the heat death of the universe will happen. for that reason, we should all stop working and stop investing. please send your dollars to me since you don't need them.

hahawe are not that special. this "global fucking pandemic" isn't ending the world any more than the Spanish Flu, the Great Depression, two world wars, etc. When you get fanatical about current events, any wise investing is out the window.Something that has also been said a million times before...I was basically yelling at people to be buying at the lows in March when this sub was too busy proclaiming the world was ending and got scolded for it.

"Just as permabears are standing on the sidelines missing out on growth permabulls are bragging about gains that will evaporate."

Gains are gains that can be taken. Missing gains entirely because you are a stubborn pessimist means you don't have the option of gains to take. Also, "GAINS ARE GONNA EVAPORATE!" What if they don't? What if they only do somewhat but not entirely?

Additionally, a good portion of this sub has been complaining about the rise in the market since March - *if you didn't buy in March, chances are you aren't buying the next decline, either.* This sub is a circle of bearishness - missing bottoms because people on here are so pessimistic that they are *certain* the market is going lower, complaining about the market all the way up the rebound and then be too negative to buy the decline before it rebounds again. It was that way in December of 2018, it was that way in March.Or you could just keep averaging into the market.  Over time the market is naturally bullish with scattered short term bear markets.  Sit back enjoy the show and collect 10%/year like the market has provided since the start.I mean, if you’re actively trading, you can make money in bull or bear market. 

Day traders didn’t just call it quits from 2008-2010.Market timing isn't a good idea. That's a road that leads to average investor gains of 2% a year.I know but it's the same principle. People that hedged missed out on massive gains. Or show me an uncorrelated investment that did as well as the stock market.Just like with this fella

Completely depends on the team and their org. It's a really big company and very few things are decided 'top down'.>From what I've heard, the white collars get paid well

Looks like you've heard wrong. See [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hwzv4a/maybe_im_crazy_but_2008_felt_worse/fz3wvqc?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share).Same as the warehouse workers.THere's huge knock on effects. 
  
If the bottom 50% can't pay the rent, we have a housing crisis that dwarfs 2008, and landlords start going bust.    Those landlords who are in the top 50% now can't pay their bills and cut back.   
  
The 20% GDP is just what they directly spend.   The money they spend being on-spent creates an echo throughout economy.   
  
Using the above logic, you would think if unemployment raises just 5%, it's not a big deal.   After all most companies are laying off their 5% least productive anyway.   
  
But we know that's the difference between a booming economy and a terrible recession.  
  
Too many flow on effects.Bezos getting sick would cause barely a blip on the running of Amazon.Youre literally talking out of your ass man. Bezos has been grooming either andrew jassy or jeff wilkes to be the next CEO after him. Jassy is the ceo of AWS and has been with amazon for 2 decades similarly Wilke is the ceo of Amazon’s Retail and has been with amazon for 2 decades as well. 

You literally could not be more wrong"idiotic" seems a bit harsh.   


My checking account makes 3.25% interest on up to $20k, so I park my emergency fund in my checking account. Maybe that isn't GREAT returns, and  maybe there is a small chance of it being stolen, but the risk seems worth the reward.WhyHardly think it's misleading? Is it not true?See I think you're confusing normal with okay

Yeah these statistics in context are pretty normal but they're not okay.It seems more sobering than feeling dramatic/misleading. An example of income inequality and a debt-fueled economy.I agree with /u/TranscendentEagle.

It's not misleading.  It's how things are.  I get what you're trying to say, that it's something of a tautology.

https://www.nextbigfuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/wealthdistribution-1.png

That's from 2015.  It's probably even more severe  now.I wan't making an argument. Just pointing out that my experience does not match what you report as theirs.

It's clear to me that this pandemic has not created an economic crisis on the level of 2008 because the people effected affect the economy the least.If they end, assuming it passes right away, how long would it take Americans to get their benefits reinstated?  If it passes right away, it shouldn't take longer than a week? They still have everyone's information, so it should be more streamlined now.We could collectively decide to drive no more than 35 mph on every street and instantly eliminate tens of thousands of deaths every single year. Why don’t we? You see, the concept of cost-benefit analysis is lost on people like you. I’ve decided that there is greater risk in taking a vaccine which has been rushed through the approval process than actually contracting COVID. So again, agree to disagree.I'm a physician. I agree with you.So, coming back later to see how well it aged is the only way to do it.It's kind of amazing that the mainstream narrative seems to be that the recession came and went, and it lasted a few weeks in March and early April.It appears to be similar with the housing market as well. It’s wild to me that people are making such large purchases when the job market is so uncertain. I get that wealthier people are less affected, but as we move through the year I expect more and more white collar positions to be eliminated. Maybe the auto and home market with finally decline this fall?It's like everyone magically added $1200 to their asking prices.Yes. Everything is being propped up when it would have otherwise failed.An important thing to note is that all the money being printed will not necessarily contribute to inflation because it isn't being spent, and therefore people aren't bidding up the prices of goodsFrom an economic standpoint, deflation is a much more likely outcome than inflation. Deflation is also a harder problem to solve.  The link below is a little detailed, but it goes into the reasoning why inflation isn't a major concern here.  

https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/29/federal-reserve-global-economy-coronavirus-pandemic-inflation-terminal-deflation-is-coming/No real inflation increase has been measured yet. The Fed would invite some inflation, they have been struggling to hit their 2% target.Honestly I think it’s similar with the motorcycle market. I see plenty of them out now (granted it’s peak season), but it’s one of the few activities that inherently involves social distancing, combined with the fact that it’s cheap enough for most people with some extra cash to get into. I’ve had my eye on a bike that typically sells for $5-6k for a year or two now, but asking prices are generally over $7k now.Just a comment not going at you or anything lolYes, but they manufacture mostly everything for the world. The money is now flowing to China, not the US.Under your theory North Korea should be a superpower too. After all they have a strong military.OPEC can barely agree on anything and you think OPEC+ is going to come to an agreement?

Saudi Arabia and Russia are literally feuding as we speak.Hah - it's pathological for you! You can't separate the economy from the stock market in your own mind.

This fall/winter is going to be horrible. Huge unemployment. Lots of death. An economy in recession. That is going to happen. Whether the stock market will care is another story. Re-read my comment - I never made any predictions about the market.>doomsayers have missed out on massive gains 

What massive gains? I sold in late February when it was clear that COVID was going to have a major impact, and the S&P 500 is currently trading at roughly the same spot it was in February when I sold.  If I had held throughout the period, I'd be at the same spot I'm at now aside from stuff like dividends.  To have experienced massive gains, you had to have little to no market exposure in February and March, but a ton of market exposure thereafter.  

Basically, you're counting your gains but ignoring your losses.FWIW, if you’re looking at a politician as your metric to determine if you’re bullish or bearish, you’re just a bad investor.What point are you trying to make? Those events didn't end the world, but they had enormous economic impacts lasting for years.  I'm confident that the sun will still rise on January 1, 2021, but I'm not confident that our economy will be as healthy as it was on January 1, 2020.You literally cited examples that wrecked the economy but are incapable of grasping that we have yet to see the full negative impact during the current global pandemic.Yeah. But rarely when we are facing a massive recession with the market at ATHs. There are always people that think the bubble will never burst or does not even exist>	I was basically yelling at people to be buying at the lows in March when this sub was too busy proclaiming the world was ending and got scolded for it.

I was one of those who heeded to the advice back in March/April.  I had previously made a shopping list and went on a spree at that time and your posts (among other peoples) helped soothe the nerves/anxiety of buying into what seemed like a sheer collapse.

I’m sure I’m not the only one who did so.

The second part of this post is very appreciated and something I keep in handy to remind me for when I feel like panicking. https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hbhexi/_/fv8wa75/?context=1


Thank you.> This sub is a circle of bearishness - missing bottoms because people on here are so pessimistic that they are certain the market is going lower, complaining about the market all the way up the rebound and then be too negative to buy the decline before it rebounds again. It was that way in December of 2018, it was that way in March.

I guess on the plus side, they never spend/invest any actual money.If you dont lock in your gains now, you wont have gained anything. The market is coming downa) i highly appreciate your contributions to this sub.  you are clearly a top 3 poster and potentially the top dog

b) not to be accusatory and ungrateful, but this feels like revisionist history.  your style is much more "here are my thoughts and a few quotes, you decide for yourself".  unfortunately i decided in march to wait and regret waiting haha, but my point is sheep on here like me need people to explicitly tell them what to do and to actually yell at them to buy at the depths (similar to your negative positions on USO, mREITs and airlines) - i don't remember that happening.  apologies if it didOn a CAPE basis the market was never below average valuations, even in March. There are plenty who will buy back in if it becomes cheaper than it was then and plenty of reasons to think that those who bought in March will see poor returns if they hold long term.The long run returns on the S&P500 are just 6%.Traders who know how to play both ways make waayyy more money during crashes too. The only ones who get blown up are the people mindlessly buying the dip every timeyeah I'm aware of that, I'm a new investor but I ain't trying to predict the market but the pandemy. I'm certain that it will get much worse in winter so I'll just follow my gut. After that, I put everything in different indexes geographically separated and I call it a day.

For now though, I'll trust my guts because it has been right so far. And yes it's probably biased but I prefer not taking the risk than to miss on gains.

Also the first time I invested was in bitcoin in 2017, and what I noticed was everyone talking about it, people who didn't invest before, etc. I'm seeing the same pattern now, so I'm taking a step back. On the plus side I invested at the bottom and sold at the top so I'm fine for now.I've been in the market until very recently so don't mind locking in those gains. But hey, it's your money.Alright, I had to go creep your posts so I could see a picture of it. That's awesome dude. I'm envious, not gonna lienever said i was nychey, thats a good idea, maybe thatll workha, ive been on the streets 4 times. Trust me, you get tired of eating out of garbage cans. Living off the land is ILLEGAL in the USA. As its not your land, but the governments. You can hide for a while, until wildlife and game come and take your tent down, and arrest you for illegal land squatting.If that motel costs more than you make at 3 jobs, yeah. 400 bucks a week gets expensive fast.So like, you do understand the whole "DAE THE MARKETS ONLY UP BECAUSE OF JPOW" is a meme and not a thing, right?There's a good probably he gets paid to reddit. There's a lot of people who honestly do. More than you would think.It does actually, I re-read it when you commented lol. OopsThat's a fair counterpoint.Sounds that way. I just know I've been contacted about an AWS position before and the salary seemed great (definitely high for the location this was in), but I've heard enough horror stories on the overworking that I turned the recruiter away. Didn't even think to look beyond the salary figure to see if it was really good compensation or not.So if someone stole your debit card, bye bye $20k?what company do you use? you can pm me directly if you dont want to give that info out to the public. I wont say a word :-)I would have $20k in savings and $5k I’m checking. Seems reversed. Unless it was a typo.Well using his information, every single member of the top 80% also own more than the entire bottom 20%.  It's not wrong, but it can paint a picture that is easily construed into more radical ideas.

Statistics are easy to warp to fit a narrative while still being true at face value.Why do you think they're not okay? What would be the alternative?It is misleading because it conjures an incorrect image. When people imagine the collective wealth of more than 20% of America for example, they aren't thinking 1 dollar. It relies on the ignorance of the audience to put the data into perspective.I'll ask again. If your tenants did not pay rent starting august 1, would that be an economically significant occurrence for you? or is that loss of income to you significant?Seeing as how everyone that's entitled to a benefit has not received a benefit, it might not be that simple even though it *should* be that simple.

My best friend was laid off in March and has not yet received his stimulus nor unemployment. Thankfully he has some savings to live off ofI would be curious to hear your rationale and evidence that led to your decision that contracting COVID is less risky than getting vaccinated, both from a personal standpoint and a public health standpoint.

And what evidence would you need to convince you that a vaccine is less risky, or that contracting COVID is more risky?But why is an mRNA vaccine more dangerous? As far as i know there is no scientific basis to this claim...Agreed my body my choice.No. You just said why.By the definition of recession, that's impossible.This is way true. The recession is far from over. There were a lot of weak employers that have been removed from the market and those jobs are going to take a long time to recover.

That said, the economy has been on the shitter though due to \~25-45 years of "trickle down" republican economic policy. There is a good chance that if we get a reverse of that idiotic economic policy, we could see 5-10% growth for 5 years. 

The thing that causes the most economic activity is to get cash into consumer's hands. Right now, \~50% of consumers are more or less broke (make less than \~50k a year). If you increase the wage of half of those consumers (say 50% of the workforce getting an extra 25k per year), That would cost roughly 2-3 trillion dollars but would probably result in 5-10 trillion in new economic activity mostly in the form of GDP.

I'm hopeful that a Biden presidency with a Senate and House could really inject the economy with some serious steroids. That is if they don't fuck up....I think this depends very much on your local market conditions. Much like 2008, my area was hardly impacted.Job market uncertainty depends on the field.  I'm pretty confident that I'll be able to keep my job during the crisis.  We've transitioned our offices into 100% WFH positions, with the expectation that we won't enter the office in person again until 2021 at the earliest, with the potential that we'll adopt WFH permanently going forward.  I currently live just outside NYC.  Like a ton of people in the NYC area, I don't own a car, and I rent my apartment.  A huge number of people are in a similar spot, many of whom plan to leave the city to lower cost of living.  These people would be adding to the demand for cars/houses, and because supply is squeezed right now with low inventory, we see increases in price.  People are taking a wait-and-see approach for now, hence the low supply.  Going forward, that could change.I'm waiting for a crash, honestly. I hope it doesn't happen, but as the expression goes: "plan for the worst, hope for the best."

I'm not sure how well I'm planning, though. \*sigh*But.... but Andrew Wang said that couldn't happen.This comment chain started with housing and cars having their prices being increased, though. More supply shortages are coming, too (at the same time that some supply shortages are being alleviated).

There's a storm slowly brewing with China as well, which could end up causing some severe supply disruption.

Lots of uncertainty. And stagnation is worse than inflation, too.And who buys all that shit they produce? The US is about half of global gdp. Not to mention the manufacturing will probably shift to even cheaper countries as China becomes more and more expensive.What are you talking about? I’m not talking about military strength in talking about the USD ties to oil. And I should say OPEC+ because Russia isn’t actually involved in the original OPEC, but at this point that still doesn’t change my argument.Do you understand why they’re feuding? It’s about money and what is the best approach to make more money.

If they see the dollar becoming unstable and could potentially risk their bottom line they will absolutely agree to move away from it.You don't seem to understand that I'm exclusively addressing the comments about the stock market.So that's your plan? sell high and buy when? if you didn't buy when it dipped it's because you were (and still are apparently) waiting for it to drop even further.

So you're one of those doomsayers I'm talking about and if never goes that low again, you will have missed out on massive gains, which was exactly my point.Peter Schiff is not a politician.as long as our politicians don't completely sell our country to China, the economic (metaphorical) sun will rise...and rise... and rise again. The American people are hard workers, we are innovative, and as long as our politicians don't shoot us in the foot, we will keep working to grow value. That's the point. You think one little pandemic can stop the machine of American prosperity, permanently? Think again bucko.it always comes back.The market is within 10% of ATHs something like 90% of the time. "we are facing a massive recession". you need to stop with these phrases. Economists have predicted 27 of the last 3 recessions.Bubbles happen, and they burst, but markets either rise in the long run or we are all going to be broke because the world economy is going to collapse "forever" (unlikely). In the first scenario, just hold onto your britches. In the second scenario, well... who cares? We have bigger problems.Another mod whose name I can't remember even called dvdmovie1 out for yelling his bullish views at people in April and he took a break from posting. The mod deleted his post after realizing dvdmovie1 is also a mod lol.

I also stopped posting in March/April as any post that didn't say "we're going lower" was auto-downvoted. Honestly, not much has changed 30-40% later.It's crazy how much money a stranger on the internet, /u/dvdmovie1, has helped me make as well. Thanks again for the quality posts.Thats the thing, in March no one had any idea what the fuck was going on! If you had cash to spare and you wanted to gamble you bought. But even among people who bought I can guarantee you almost everyone wishes they were more aggressive. And that speaks to the uncertainty that was there. And most people just did nothing, because that’s a very reasonable thing to do when you have incomplete information.>plenty of reasons to think that those who bought in March will see poor returns if they hold long term.

Lol. I guess investing isn't for you then.If you adjust for inflation it drops down to 7% from 9.8%.  Either way it's bullish because it's a positive number.Why not just put more of your money in safe assets? Then, you can hedge your bets instead of going all or nothing.

You could go 30% VT AND 70% BND then, when you feel ready, you can increase your equity allocation.

You could just have a lower risk tolerance than being 100% equities which is ok. Just add more bonds to your portfolio until you're in a place where you feel comfortable.lol no problem and thank you!!   They are shockingly affordable if you really want one.   Gets more looks than a Ferrari too if that's your thing.Jesus christ dude. How.. from the post i just sent you..Do you think my financial outlook involves memes. Keep talking.. you are sounding even dumber than I originally gave you credit for. It was a jib at you because your unlimited confidence in what seems to be a worsening situation. Wallstreet is disconnected from the work force.. People make wall street money.. not the other way around.. and when we go back into lock down after missing the mark the first time around..

3. You can use a debit card to withdraw from savings, too.It’s a smaller local credit union. Another one in the area is 3% up to $15k, which makes me think these types of accounts are fairly common.No not a typo. I don't know why I'd switch it. The interest rate at my bank in my savings account is like .1%.The fact that 20% of the richest country in the world have zero net worth seems problematic, no?Oh, I didn't realize you cared.

It would not impact me in a significant way. In no way would it change my life.Fair enough, I've seen some places have backlogs for unemployment, not sure why they didn't hire more people to help process all the claims?

  Here in Canada there was a program called CERB, anyone who was affected by COVID employment wise could apply and get $2000 directly deposited to your bank, a lot of people got double payments for some reason.  It was obviously abused, and the CRA is going be like bloodhounds trying to get the funds back. However, the instant support was seriously helpful for a lot of people. Again it was abused, and they'll be looking into it, but the uncertainty at the time when CERB became active was so high.An mRNA is theoretically safer, and Moderna's Phase I data look pretty tolerable in terms of safety, but the concern is that Moderna is a new company and mRNA is an unproven new technology.Not sure we're reading the same conversation. You have a good day there.What are your thoughts on Build Back Better? IMO seems to be a good solution to jack up economy and simultaneously tackle ccGood luck getting taxes raised to actually pay for it thoughThat’s a good point. My hometown is a couple hours north of NYC so it’s been saturated with weekenders for a while now, however property values are really beginning to accelerate as people permanently move there from the city. 

My job is similar in that it’s WFH now through at least 2021 with the potential to become permanent. I am not confident in my job however (Aerospace industry), and I have a feeling that with the exception of certain industries many people will be losing their jobs moving forward as demand and government stimulus is reduced.Opportunistic gouging rather than actual inflation.

One is anecdotal, the other is measured and weighted.Not sure why you're being downvoted. Butthurt "Wang gang" bros here in r/investing? lolChinas debt isn't too large of a problem just yet for basically 2 reasons

1. it's corporate and consumer debt, if shit goes south the gov can still borrorw to make things less bad

2. chines people have an insane savings rate. It means the gov didn't have to pay out large unemployment fhecks. It also represents a huge potential source of capitalOil is worth less than clean water these days. Exxon Mobil chevron etc are dying. In 10 years oil will be a small insignificant industry. The petrodollar is meaningless now. It’s not 2008 anymoreOil producing nations use the Petro-Dollar in exchange for the US Navy enforcing clear shipping lanes and providing the Saudis with enormous influence and weapons. Remember Saudi Arabia was the ones who first agreed to make the Petro-dollar a thing. 

https://www.worldometers.info/oil/oil-production-by-country/

The has massive influence over itself (obviously), Canada, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, UAE, Brazil, Mexico and Kuwait.

There is also the well known fact that threatening to go away form the Petro-dollar does not normally go well for the countries involved. Iran, Iraq, Venezuela, Libya, Syria. 

It's not impossible, but thinking it is in anyway likely is foolish.Okay then here's my prediction: who the hell knows? 🤷‍♂️ Anyone trying to predict where the market will go right now is an idiot.>So that's your plan? sell high and buy when? if you didn't buy when it dipped it's because you were (and still are apparently) waiting for it to drop even further.

Me personally? Sell high and gradually buy back into the market, especially after the election.  I went from 85% stock at the start of the year to 40% stock in late February, and I've gradually increased that to 50% stock now.  I'm generally a buy-and-hold investor, but it was clear in mid-February that this would be a major event.  I recognize that I'll forego  potential gains in 2020 on my cash position, but I'm okay with that as a risk mitigation strategy. 

I dispute the idea of massive gains though.  I'm ignoring things like dividends to make the point, but if I had $100 invested in an S&P 500 fund at the start of 2020, I would have had $69 in late March and $98 today.  You're looking at the rise from $69 to $98 and seeing massive gains, but that's not a fair comparison because only the doomsayers would have been all-cash in late March.  Bullish investors like yourself would have been invested in the market at the start of the year, so their total experience YTD is a 2% *loss*, not massive gains.

>So you're one of those doomsayers I'm talking about and if never goes that low again, you will have missed out on massive gains, which was exactly my point.

Disagree with you here too.  My 401(k) is on autopilot, so I buy into the market every two weeks with the same amount regardless of market conditions.  I've been doing that for more than a decade now.  I also dumped a little extra into the markets in March and April when things were really bad, so I did get massive gains on that money.  However, I can't ignore the massive losses on the 40% stocks that I held through March.  YTD, I'm roughly flat.LOL I thought it said Adam Schiff 😂 my faultFunny you bring up being "fanatical" about world events yet your comment is riddled with fanaticism of never-ending "American prosperity".

Sure, I would love it that way but we gotta be aware of the various shortcomings if we want to preserve it.Yeah but the conversation is when is the optimal time to invest. You can make that argument with anything related to the economy. Why even talk about it then?Every respectable forecast is predicting a massive contraction in growth in 2020. On a completely different scale to anything we have seen for a while. Asking me to 'stop with these phrases' is just sticking your fingers in your ears>Economists have predicted 27 of the last 3 recessions.

And so have a much better track record than this sub?True. But saying the market will be up eventually is no better than saying the market will go down at some point. None of us have a clue about the exact timing yet the bulls expect the bears to be able to call it with precision or they're 'wrong'😄 such is life on the Internet. Doom and gloom index is always at ATHOr I am a value investor aware of how poor annualised returns are if you buy overvalued assets.Not that I'm in the market for one right now, but what's a rough cost estimate for one?DAE THINK THE MARKETS WILL CRASH: after Q1 earnings, after Q2 earnings, after March/April/May/June unemployment are released, after PPP ends?You dont need a pin for online purchases. But number 2 is the real answerSure. Are you suggesting that richest and poorest should all somehow have the same amount of wealth?I think the response to your question is super long as it predates COVID, stemming from systematic inefficient bureaus of government. Add on significantly less tax revenue governments are receiving, and local govts eventually can’t hire more people without getting backlash from its citizens for more deficit spending than usual. 

Its wild that something so simple can be so tangled and difficult to solve because the inherent issues in our society are exacerbatedAgreedTake it directly from the new deal. That's exactly what FDR did and I think Biden is trying to do the same. If Trump is reelected, or if the Senate doesn't go Democrat, we'll get a shitty economy (but the stock market might do well).Giving people free money means that the entire s/d curve gets shifted up by the amount of free money.On reddit, mocking the approved narrative is frowned upon, and censored if possible.The petrodollar is not meaningless what an ignorant thing to say.

Just because the US shale industry is dying doesn’t mean that oil isn’t an incredibly important asset when it comes to international affairs.Except now if we invade a country to protect the dollar Russia, China, North Korea, Iran would all take the opportunity to fight the US, essentially causing another world war.

Either way you look at it not good for the economy.Thank you, glad we agree.exactly, we shouldn't be trying to time the market or predict crashes. Invest now, DCA, your choice. When a big crash happens, if you have the cash, invest at that moment (when your portfolio is solid red). Otherwise, we should all stop pretending to be fortune tellers.I'm invested for the next 50 years, so idc what happens in the short term. Go ahead and try and time the market.the market doesn't have to be up eventually; it is up now. It depends on your entry point but look at the entire history of the market and it's up, and it's beaten inflation. past performance is no guarantee; but what is? Why do we do this in the first place? Get some dividends; that's the best bet.Tell me one legitimate reason you would invest now if you thought we were going lower than March lows long-term?A roadster like mine would be around $20-25k.  30k for show quality.   You could also get a tudor or sedan for much cheaper $15k for a decent one.There's only one thing to imply: 20% of the population should not have zero net worth.

Even then, it's actually like 60% of the population owns 0-3% of the US's net wealth.

We could take this table:

Percent US Population | Percent US Net Worth
---|---
1% | 35%
4% | 28%
5% | 14%
10% | 12%
20% | 9%
20% | 3%
40% | 0%

... and make it look like this:

Percent US Population | Percent US Net Worth
---|---
1% | 30%
4% | 23%
5% | 16%
40% | 17%
50% | 14%


If we took 10% of the wealth away from the top 5% wealthiest people in the country and redistributed such that the bottom 95% of the population had a total 47%, the top 1% could still own 30% of the total net wealth of the United States, the top 5% would still own 53% of the net wealth of the country.

It goes from 80% of the country sharing a combined 12% of the wealth, to 90% of the country sharing 31% of the wealth.

The super rich get to stay rich, but at least 9/10s of the country would have _something_.No, I'm not saying that at all. If youre going to attempt a strawman, at least base it on something I said.I didn't downvote you, but d remained constant since loss of income borked that half of the curve. We won't actually know until CPI-U and PCE reports come out.In 20 years oil will decline as solar, wind, geothermal and all the other alternative energies clobber it.> Russia, China, North Korea, Iran would all take the opportunity to fight the US, essentially causing another world war.

Lol. Do you honestly believe this? Iran wouldn't even do anything when we killed their top general. China and Russia declaring war on the US is so outside of the realm of possibility, it's as useful as talking about Aliens coming down and replacing the US dollar with the Space-dollar.

Are you forgetting that Russia has literally annexed territory from it's European neighbors and the American and EU response was essentially wagging their finger? And yet you think the massively weaker Russians are going to fight the US. Seriously dude. Get a grip.No one is pretending to be a fortune teller but you don’t need to be one when the writing is in bright red on the wall. Look at the charts from the crash from 08 & the one in the 80’s. They’re identical. That’s the point you’re not understanding. The economy is overstretched right now.

Edit:

Imagine walking into a room full of financial analysts & blurting “ ha ha yeah, but it’ll come back. It always does.” You’ll get laughed at right out of the building. That’s not the point of what we’re saying.I'm actually half-in half-out so I'm fairly ambivalent on what happensYou wouldn't. But who thinks that?Oh wow, that is way less expensive than I would have thoughtThe problem with that is that money will quickly find it's way back to the rich anyway. There is nothing you can do to make certain people have savings who would rather spend. Neither should we. That is their choice. Wealth redistribution is nothing but stealing and it already exists in the form of welfare and social programs and increasing tax brackets.Sorry I misread what you said as "is 20% of the richest having no networth not problematic?".

Regarding the 20% of people in the richest country not having a positive networth... I don't think that's necessarily problematic or preventable. I was in that demographic myself for many years as a student and in the beginning of my career. I then quickly climbed to the top 10% within a decade.

There will also be many people who will stay in that bracket for life due to personal choices which includes many of my colleagues that have the same income but spend like money is going out of style.Yeah people said this 20 years ago too. Id say we still have another 50-100 years of oil dominance unless there is some major breakthrough in how solar energy capture works.China declaring war on the US is on the same level as aliens? Are you serious? You haven’t been paying attention if you actually think this.> plenty of reasons to think that those who bought in March will see poor returns if they hold long term.

-u/Khashoggis-Thumbs

Maybe what you mean to say is poor marginal returns from right now here today, because as someone who bought in March I assure you my returns are looking fine. If SE or SHOP or AYX get back down to anywhere near what they were in March/April, then I'll be buying them again.Right?  People think they are rare since you don't see many around but the truth is they cranked out over 5 million of them back in the day.   98% of the survivors are now owned by boomers and silent generation that are slowing dieing out... the cars have to go somewhere!How come the oil companies are dropping the soap? Let’s look at how old king coal is doing shall we? Peabody energy and arch coal have seen better days and Exxon Mobil/Saudi Aramco will join them ;).China declaring war on the US over an intervention in some oil producing third world country is absolutely on the same level as aliens. 

It's pretty clear you haven't done much reading on the Cold-War. Nuclear powers don't go into open war because of third worlders. Like I said in my last comment, get a grip.Oil companies being down right now was NOTHING to do with renewable energy. I’m done arguing with someone who is so ill informed in this situation.They would declare war because we are threatening their economy daily. They would use the opportunity to strike while they can gather support. You’re the one who needs to get a grip lol.What I’m saying is oil is becoming like coal. Sure it will have niche industrial uses such as lubricants etc so it will fare better than coal but there’s a reason oil has never recovered since 2008.Lay off the Call of Duty. 

Your understanding of geopolitics is abysmal. Nuclear War over Nigeria. Seems legit.Says the guy who said war with China is less likely than aliens visiting earthWar with China over an oil producing third world nation is.

The much stronger US didn't go to war with Russia after they literally annexed a portion of a country that borders the EU and NATO. Yet you think the two much weaker nations of China and Russia are going to declare (nuclear) war on the US (and NATO) over country thousands of miles away. 

Lmao. Stick to Call of Duty.No I’m saying war will happen because of how we are threatening the Chinese economy and they will use any situation they can to gain an edge. 

Guarantee you’re under 20 years old the way you keep bringing up Call of Duty as an insult too lmao. I don’t play that game and i’m guessing you get a lot of your geopolitical genius from reddit, right?I get my knowledge of geopolitics from reading. You should try it. 

It's very obvious you view geopolitics like a video game. Open War is so absurdly unlikely between nuclear powers. 

You know what will destroy the Chinese Economy? Open War with NATO, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, plus tons of others. For a fucking country like Libya. Makes a lot of sense dude. 

Do better. It's embarrassing. I hope your investing isn't as bad as your opinions on geopolitics.Ah so you are under 20. I’m done arguing international politics with a college freshman.LOL.

The projection is strong with this one. Back to Call of Duty with you. 

I'm pretty confident you just realized how stupid your opinions are. Laughable.lmao I don’t play call of duty and just don’t feel like repeating myself. If you don’t see how likely war with China is then you’re either ignorant, an idiot, or both (I’m thinking it’s the last option)Go back to r/conspiracy and r/JoeRogan,

Suddenly the faux-intellectualism with near zero actual understanding makes a lot of sense. Making Joe proud. He got rich on it after all.LMAO and r/politics and r/neoliberal are much better. What a fucking idiotYes, neoliberal actually does understand geopolitics. Geopolitics is literally a core part of neoliberalism. 

r/politics does not. 

Good thing I mostly post on there to make fun of ignorant Bernie Bros.

FUCK!  It didn't workBrilliant post! If you're interested in this stuff, check out Ben Felix and his podcast The Rational Reminder. If you want, and I highly recommend you do, send this to them at the podcast website. I'm sure they'd love to talk about it over there.

Edit: One suggestion is instead to have annualized returns on the y-axis since that is the dependent value.Others seem to say the complete opposite. https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2020/07/it-depends/Nope.  That is the entire point of dollar cost averaging.Very interesting.  There was an article on seeking alpha recently showing that the CAPE has excellent predictive value the subsequent 10 years of returns.   But over longer periods the performance reverts to average I guess 

Current cape is very high so expected forward returns are approx 5 to 6%Hell yes! The Simple Path to WealthIt all depends on your time horizon. If you can afford to invest the money and not touch it for 40 years its going to gain tremendous value. But if your plan is to make enough money to buy a house in 6-12 months while the market is hot, consider it damn-near gambling.I would say no. You can’t time the market. Sure you can try, buy the dips. But I believe that if you find the right company or etf or whatever you’re buying, just buy it. You can’t find the perfect time to buy.Whats the avrg return ?

Also, this is why you **globally** diversify.Never the same after that nuke broIs this annualized or average annual returns? There is a difference.I agree! If you are interested, then look at the imgur link I included in the description. I find no relation between the cost of the market when you buy and long-term returns in all 35 year periods between 1910 and 2020.If Capitalism ends there's no where to invest your money anyway.A whole of lot of gray area between business as usual and the end of capitalism.**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*Here's what will happen and i will come back to this once earnings are released next week.

&#x200B;

1) AMD will get pumped hard until earnings

2) It will beat top and bottom but will dump, similar to microsoft.  This is our environment right now.Who remembers the days when AMD was the one dropping the ball like this at every turn? My oh my how the tables have turned. It’s pretty incredible.Intel is still viable but be aware that they (and this has been reported before) are essentially milking a product line from like 2015 (ish) at this point in terms of architecture and node size. Honestly they have no one to blame but themselves, but in case there are any actual longterm investors here - be aware that this problem has been boiling for years and the fallout is likely to be huge unless AMD fumbles at the 2-yard line or intel throws about 3 Hail Mary's.70b vs 6b yearly revnue lmaoYes, AMD is kicking ass and taking names right now.  I started buying shares when they were around $13.  And I'll be buying more since I think there's still plenty of room for it to grow.  

But, if you own Intel, don't sell.  Intel and AMD are like Ford and Chevy.  One will be top dog for a while until the other comes out with a new innovation and takes the lead.  Then in time it'll reverse again.  And again.  I'm an AMD fan, but I highly doubt Intel will stay behind forever.  I'm betting they're in a more competitive position 5 years from now and that those who bought AMD while holding Intel are going to be the real winners.Both NVIDIA and AMD have great leadership, Intel does not, hence their troubleIntel has the smartest minds in the business, they've been through worse times and they'll deliver.

And AMD will be the king for the next 4 years for sure, maybe even longer.Would Intel warrant a re rating if they instead outsourced their next 7nm cpu? They should have the 10 nm ready to go by end year and they could very well have their 7nm going next year should they have TSM or Samsung produce it. Or would it take longer for them to get on the waitlist?Lets not forget the both the Xbox series X and Playstation 5 are both using AMD processors.And I was downvoted for calling Intel the next IBM ...

AMD will profit from this, but who is building AMD’s 7nm chips? And who is building Apple’s chips when they transition away from Intel? Who is getting subsidized by every western government that fears China? TSMC to the moon.Can anyone please explain why AMD is considered a meme stock?Are you just gonna ignore TSMC?~~What? AMD was down by 3.58% yesterday.~~

Edit: Oh sh\*\*.. after hours. Damn, I sold my AMD shares yesterdayA nice time to long INTC IMO. Yes, next gen chips are delayed however, fundamentals remain strong, plus  a nice dividend. Intel has such a huge amount of capital available to get through the slump short term. Took a small starter position after hours.This happened back in the early 2000s with the Athlon XP. I expect Intel will recover.

There was a time back around then that people were worried about Nvidia because the GeForce FX was a major stinker.

They turned out ok.

Edit: Fanboys bein salty.Somehow I managed to buy right at the lowest point during trading hours and checked back around an hour later pleasantly surprised to see +5%. Only regret is not buying more.Intel must have some of the worst management in the business. Right up there with AT&T.Are there any contracts that are something like AMD/Intel stock price. I want to bet that intel will go down compared to AMD.Honestly this is a great buy the dip for Intel. Yeh they're delaying the chip release, but they still beat on earnings. Still a solid company.Maybe an unpopular opinion but... 

I don't consider AMD a meme stock. They have solid leadership and growing market share. Additionally, they're heavily invested in R&D (aka innovation), and are profitable. What's meme-ish about that? Looks like a pretty solid company to me.

Edit 1: At the time of writing this, they're up $9+. So...idk, the market is wonky this year. LolSold my position in the 40s and low 50s, had bought in on average at $13

Stock is now way ahead of itself IMOCool! Intel dropped 10%+

It just means I bought more Intel.Bought puts at $61 today. Wish me luck.Intel's management must have some backwards priorities. Seems like they haven't been able to innovate or even just coast for the last 5 years.I am one of the suckers who bought into their 10th generation chips and barely got any performance gains lol\-17% now for INTC. wish i had free cash right now to get it, that's a steal.Analysts at Piper Sandler: "  Intel is now targeting the end of 2022/early 2023 for its 7nm technology. AMD is already on 7nm with most of its chipsets, and the company is talking about moving to 5nm in the next generation, which we think will be next year. Overall, we believe the Intel delays could have a strong positive impact on AMD's market share. With Intel struggling to get to 7nm, the company may have to outsource to a foundry. If that were to happen in roughly another year or so, both would outsource leading edge technology. In our view, AMD could move much closer to a 50/50 market share split (or even higher) versus our current thinking of maybe 35% at best."I just want to say thanks to this forum. I decided to buy AMD over Intel a while back based on everyone’s analysis of the companies. I’ll be holding AMD for a longtime and I’ll be buying more, but it’ll be paying for dinner tonight! $$In this environment:

Me today: I knew holding my AMD stocks would pay off!

Me in two days i think: AMD has crashed! I should have SOLD!!!They also just announced that they are considering outsourcing manufacturing. With their recent history om not surprised, 10nm was massively delayed and is only now starting to enter mass production, 3 years after schedule. And even then not in any big chips as their yield is too bad. And now 7nm delays, how long until they go fabless? It used to be unthinkable thst Intel of all companies would go fabless, but now its not that far off.

I dont understand why Intel havent tried to make a new architecture as they have problems with their node shrink, a new architecture seems like the best way to increase preformance, but instead we have been on skylake for 4 years. With extremely incremental improvment to clockspeed and ipc due to a maturing 14nm process node.

The only think keeping Intel up has been that amd was so far behind, but now amds zen 2 is almost equal to Intels skylake in terms of singel core preformance. I give Intel 2 more generations to make either their 7nm work or being a new architecture to market until amd is far ahead of them. Of course Intel has already lost in multi core.

Now i Kinda expected that this was going to eventually happen after intel announced that they were outsourcing some low end chipsets to tsmc a year back, that combine with amds increased market share and apple leaving Intel for arm, TSMC is going to get a lot more buisniss, at least untill a few years down the line when apple starts their own fabs. That being said im buying $TSM and $AMD.

Also, AMD $69, niceHonestly go and read intel annual reports a few years back.. they keep promising that they are about to catch up etc etc...

They never do, and it is only getting worse, I bought Intel in the past, I wouldn't get even close to those shares again.Let’s also not forget that it powers the PS5 and recently Sony had to add 50% more to production to keep up with demand, bought 4 shares yesterday and wish I bought 6 lolI got baby amounts of stock rn and it was nice after losing $67 in a day to all of a sudden being up $117 or something.intel is def a buy today, back the truck upI'm happy I sold AMD at 60.  I have 30 years of AMD/ATI letting me down with terrible products, I don't know what I was thinking buying the stock.

I made a few dollars on it.  Even if it goes up, I'm glad I'm out.Intel seems to be the living embodiment of the adage "get woke go broke" https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bui7gp/the_past_few_years_of_intel_finally_make_sense/

See also the comparison of the 'woke' ETFs SHE and PXWIX versus say market index VTI. Huge underperformance by "gender woke" companies. There were studies suggesting these companies did well, but it seems to be a different story when you put money on the line. 'Tis often so.Welp,  glad I bought calls this morning I guessBoom!Does anybody here think it’s possible that it’s because of coronavirus? I mean designing and manufacturing chips has to be extremely hands-on.Doesn't matter, intel still makes better chips than AMD. The only reason AMD price started going up is because of the crypto boom where people started buying video cards. No person in their right mind would build an AMD processor pc over an intel processor.wow amazingly for some mysterious reason I open 1000 put contracts on INTC expiring tomorrow and 1000 call contracts on AMD expiring tomorrow    😋  I'm so amazingSeems tempting to load up on AMD calls and sell them just before earnings.Doesn't that happen to AMD every time?Beat analyst expectation, miss market expectationsWould you say Intel is a smart buy since it dropped \~10% or is that stock doomedThat's what most people think it'll do now which means that it won't do that.Agreed, I have been watching (and trading) AMD for about 5 years. It consistently rises until earnings then a massive sell off no matter the news reported. I recommend that you do not hold thru earnings.So if you know what will happen, why are you not making unlimited money from this knowledge?  Isn't that the entire point?Yeah im new to stocks but im sensing from what ive gathered so far, in this market it seems like people are just putting a bunch of money into stuff thats going up, selling, taking a profit and watching it crash on like a daily cycle.When was their last dump?  After last earnings?It also happened in the early to mid 2000’s. AMD kicked intel’s ass for a while. History will repeat itself as Intel returns with a revolutionary product like the Duo and Quad cores were.It really is.  Intel had such a massive lead on fabs and a far better processor design for years (bulldozer was AMD's NetBurst) and completely blown that lead by failing to get their 10nm process to work well.  Don't get me wrong Zen is a way better architecture than what AMD was putting out before but this entire recovery in AMD's share price has pretty much exclusively been driven by Intel screwing up for years here to a borderline unfathomable extent.how the turntables....I literally learned about GPUs in the past month. Sad I didn't get to witness  this hahaIntel has been spending more on R&D than Nvidia has been generating in revenue. What you said is more or less what everyone else thinks, but there is way more to Intel then semiconductorsThe market was hoping that the 10nm fumble is over and that the company has found its aggressive pace again, but now we discover that the issues that caused the 10nm fumble might still be there on 7nm, which could indicate a long term slump in Intel's technical abilities. That's not a good sign, but Intel will always find a way back in this field, it's just too big with loads of resources. The question is how long will that take and how patient investors are willing to be. I think a lot of investors will be wary, but also a lot that believe in the company. The stock will take a hit for a few years, so if you're a long term investor, maybe not a terrible idea to buy over the next couple of years?I inherited a few thousand in stocks all in intel... clearly not a good time to sell and I don’t typically invest in single stocks. What should I do?I guess the argument against this is Intel high performance gaming skus for laptops takes a big leap with tgl H less than a year from now and then shortly after that another leap where they likely gain performance lead once again (they still lead in single task but won't regain multi task lead until Alder lake). I guess what I'm saying is Intel is near the end of milking their roadmap and are still breaking revenue records.That's exactly why its funny how AMD can produce tech which Intel are dreaming about.At one point, Intel had the best leadership (Andy Grove)Seems like their family is good at that, because Nvidia's CEO and AMD's CEO are related to eachother, uncle and neiceYeah, nvidia and amd are lead by former engineers, they know what they are doing, know the semi conductor space. Intel is lead by some random buisniss man.Intel has also bean counters running the place and gutting long term plays to save a few bucks. Sold ARM division just before the iPhone came out, sold the mobile modem division (to Apple) as we transition to 5G, dropped the efforts on GPUs multiple times (missing the boom in AI),  stopped making SSD controllers, etc. This on top of their failings with node shrinks.

It's all fine to have great engineers but management is only allowed to miss the boat so many times before it becomes another Kodak.Smart people that got get lazy with no competition. They got caught with their pants down and but didn't realize even when amd was making headway. Now its code red over there and they are stumbling.I still want to know why Jim Keller left.  I have a suspicion that there is a culture issue there and it may take new management to fix it.People working at Intel always say working there is like working for government, bad sign if you're doing cutting edge stuff.> Intel has the smartest minds in the business

Do they? In terms of fabs, arguably the best people are at TSMC. For processor stuff, AMD is beating them. One of the best people in terms of semiconductors is Jim Keller. And he [very abruptly resigned resigned from Intel](https://www.anandtech.com/show/15846/jim-keller-resigns-from-intel-effective-immediately) last month.Smart minds get poached by competition. Don’t think for a second high end engineers don’t think about “I wonder if working for that company working with newer tech would be more interesting”.  

Talent is key to innovation. Ideas come from smart people, smart people gravitate to good leaders and companies that get out of their way and let them go as fast as possible. 

Very likely intel has lost that rep in the marketplace.They used to. Until bean-counter CFO turned CEOs stifled innovation.Id argue 18 months (Alder lake time frame) not 4 yearsSpeaking as someone in the industry. hahahahahahahaha hahahahahahaha, no. Intel definitely does not have the brightest minds in the business.Smart people are ditching left and right. Smart people don't like being shat on by management. The guy who spearheaded Zen left to work for intel 2 years ago and he already noped the fuck out of there, presumable because of management and this news. These people don't need money, they need to be allowed to execute.King of what? Lol Intel can buy out amd tomorrow with cash if they wanted toCorrect me if I'm wrong, but in the earnings call they said that if they were to use external foundries they would focus on 10nm.  They expect 7nm in late 2022 or 2023.AMD is king of the budget build gaming PC too.The margin on those is probably microscopic, while Xeons are basically printing money for Intel.Even better - who manufacturers the machines that TSMC uses??TSMC is by far the safest semi play in my mind. I hold NVDA, TSM, LSCC in the semi space weighted in that orderASML has basically a monopoly on EUV lithography.Intel is definitely headed to be the next IBM. But they are aren't there yet. They still have increasing revenues. What's crazy is that they are at lower valuations than IBM who continues to have decline in revenues YOY.That's pretty ignorant of both companies' business models$TSM all the way

Until China takes TaiwanTheir p/e makes it a meme stock + the stock moves like a meme stockThe stock price is almost completely decoupled from the revenue the company actually generates. It's backed by hype and hope.I just learned about them today.  And bought in today shortly after.  Great growth with a nice dividend on top.  Will DCA into this for sometime.  I bought in on the Robinhood app, and I am brand new to using something other than vanguard for investing.  Is it a smart vessel?  ESP considering the concept of dividends?  Or are higher paying dividend stocks better in tax advantaged accounts?This is not the early 2000s at all. Back then Intel had the best fabs in the business and no one else came close. Today they are not only competing with AMD in terms of chip design, but with TSMC on manufacturing capabilities. And that is a much tougher fight.Time has changed. The business has been always about scale. This time around, though, Intel’s scale is matched by TSMC, AMD’s manufacturer. I see a long bull case of AMD for this reason.

This is also the reason Apple dumped INTC not long ago. Because TSMC or Samsung will have the scale to match INTC in terms of manufacturing capability, apple feels safe working on its own CPU.Puts on AMD?  If so, ouch!couldn't resist it, got some.Don't you know ? 7nm at amd is same as 10mm at Intel! This drop makes me laugh.AMD chips were powering the Xbox One and PS4 when the stock was trading at $2/share.You shouldn’t be. AMD has fantastic leadership with Lisa Su at the helm and their new processors are fantastic in every category, eating up intels market share. An AMD resurgence is just around the corner.I used to believe in the mantra of go woke go broke like 2-3 years ago until I realized it was all bullshit cherry-picking. At least in the film/gaming industry. Especially with captain marvel, a movie pretty much designed only to make money on the fact that the main character is a woman. Every comment I saw was something of “go woke go broke, marvel slipped up this time!!”, when in reality it was one of the highest grossing films for marvel. We even see it today with The last of us 2. The main character is a buff woman and every capital G gamer is having a mental battle over how it’s not possible. The same line is repeated of “They ruined the last of us! Go woke go broke!”., yet it’s the the absolutely crushing it in sales, and up on the top charts. 

I feel the phrase is just a way for people to support their own belief that being woke is stupid, that everything is fine as is, and that it’s just “libtards wrong”.As a SE and someone who follows the industry closely, you are incredibly, woefully uneducated and ignorant about this market. AMD's resurgence had virtually nothing to do with the crypto craze, and was driven entirely by the retirement of Bulldozer and the introduction of Ryzen. It was a game changer for AMD and Intel, the same way AMD's introduction of the superior x86_64 instruction set was over IA_64. Disruptive enough and timed precisely enough that it forced Intel's hand into a number of shoddy releases on the i7 line. Ryzen is objectively a superior product to anything in the i7 lineup now for all but a few work cases. Memory latency was one of the biggest advantages Intel had, and that advantage is now gone - so it will force Intel to be innovative again, which they haven't had to do since the failure of Bulldozer. I look forward to what Intel will do - the last time AMD was this disruptive, it forced Intel to ditch the P4 architecture, and they came up with Core - the base of all Intel desktop and server CPUs today. We could see another revolution from Intel as the result of AMD's recent success.

You have no idea what you are talking about.> No person in their right mind would build an AMD processor pc over an intel processor

You are out of your mind if you actually think this, Intel only beats AMD in gaming by a small margin and gets creamed everywhere else, including price. Nobody is buying Intel CPUs anymore except the top 1% performance chasers.Let’s see the screenshot.No you didntI bought 1 AMD 65 C expiring 8/21 today near the close just for the hell of it. Paid 2.09.Too late, it will pump on this news AH, open high, and immediately sell off within 24 hours like everything else.Do it with straddles/strangles on any company 2 weeks before earnings.It is actually not always the way, 2019 q3 earning was a recent exception. Amd had a modest drop after ER for one day or two, and then rose $20 from there almost non-stop.

IMHO, it really has something to do with future outlook, if Dr. Su provides a great outlook this time, I don’t see a big drop post ER.Yes this is the way.Yeah pretty much. Intel isn't going anywhere for now unless their CEO gets caught with hookers and blow or something of that nature. AMD chips still aren't competing with Intel.Look at their gross margin erosion and Q3 guidance and even lower gross marginAnalysts are worthless and their expectations should always be ignored. They’re tarot card readers for grown men.I don't know. Do you want a good company for a bad price or a bad company for a good price?Losing partnership with Apple is a big deal, and as a PC enthusiast, I can confidently say the AMD ryzen 9 series is destroying the i9 right now in terms of how many I see in custom builds. Why? It’s significantly cheaper and has more cores. Intel is honestly  snoozing hard right now and in desperate need of innovation, considering they have not made any significant leap in technology since the release of the i7 like well over a decade ago. Lets also not forget that AMD powers the PS5 which had a 50% increase in production to keep up with demand, I have some Sony shares as well that have been doing pretty good.Depends on if you think intel will keep its success in the future. Intel's a solid company with stable revenue and earnings. And it's much, much larger than AMD and more diversified. AMD is a growth stock, and shows promise, but I am uncertain about its long term viability. Imo I would take the safe bet and snag a few shares of intel here and there when it drops, like this rn.If you want to buy Intel then wait at least to the low end of 50. I think tomorrow it will dip down to 51-52$ and end the day around 54-56$.Very smart. AMD is an even smarter sellIntel is diversified, but the most profitable products the server CPU and CPU for laptops are under attack from AMD. The technological and cost advantage of AMD is huge, but AMD lacked the infrastructure for maintenance and design of systems . Should AMD be able to build a comparable infrastructure for servers and OEM CPU for laptops I wouldn't give a cent for Intel.Nah. I don't have faith in their leadership. The fact that they could let AMD (a company near death) get up on them like this is astounding. Its being run by suits who only saw dollar signs, and now they are paying for their lack of investment into internal R&D. 

I wouldn't touch them until they have a competitive product.The industry is moving toward ARM SoCs.  So I don't see Intel making another comeback like that but that doesn't mean it's any good for AMD either.Didn't Intel undercut amd heavily in the early 200s to kill off AMD?  That got them into all the desktops and laptops.Intel crushed AMD with the Core 2 Duo and it has taken AMD 12 ish years to finally catch back up. Now they look poised to dominate Intel for the next decade.So intel’s the new Blackberry?Bro r u a cavemanDon't bother explaining this on r/Investing where people think "Intel, oh, ahhhhhh, they make gaming CPUs and I know AMD doing better than them at that!"

I like to say Intel is like an oil company - their business relies on a crucial input, semiconductors. In the same way, a vertically integrated oil company uses petroleum to make all sorts of different chemicals to satisfy different markets. 

Intel uses its main input to make 20 or 30 types of outputs while AMD outputs 5-10 products.> but there is way more to Intel then semiconductors

Not really, no. Just read Intel's earnings report

> We derive a substantial majority of our revenue from platform products.

Almost all their revenue comes from PC, data center, and memory chips. Everything else is a foot note.More dollars spend on R&D doesn't in and of itself guarantee a superior, or even a good, outcomeUh no. Anything Intel does other than semiconductors is a drop in the bucket.Hold. I'm not sure I would reinvest the dividends in Intel though. At least use them to diversify your portfolio.If you had the equivalent amount in cash would you put it all in Intel? No? Then rebalance.Is AMD going to translate that technology into revenue at some point?Selling the modem business was smart. There’s not a way they could even make a profit off it. Why not get a billion dollars.Dude calm down...they've missed the boat once. It's not the end of the world.Smart people with bad management, also those smart people may have left.

This is top down systemic bad results.  It is not easily fixed by time or money.  It will take a lot of work.  They could never recover or it could take 10-20 years like amd did to beat them.You're not wrong, but it happens. Semiconductors are a very cut throat business and that's why it's so fascinating.They should have just moved to TSMC fab.What I've heard made it seem like Jim Keller was an asshole - who was right in trying to change Intel culture, but went about it in a very arrogant way. And I also heard in the two years he was at Intel he didn't do much of anything because he wanted everything done his way obviously.Been my experience at a variety of large tech firms.  I also doubt it is anything new.  Intel has been a big company for decades.> Intel can buy out amd tomorrow with cash if they wanted to

Been that way for years.  I think the anti-trust implications keep them from buying up AMD.It’s turtles all the way down. Invest in turtles.KLA, ASML, etc. Their stocks have been going up like crazy past few years.That would be ASML.LRCX makes electrofill machines for 3D NANDThat’s why I bought it. The logic was that they couldn’t lose, and after several years that logic still holds up. In hindsight I wish I had gone with the riskier choice of AMD, but hindsight is 2020.Aren't you worried about Samsung catching up?China is like RIGHT there and Taiwan is on their shopping list. If anything threatens Taiwan, TSMC is going to turn into a very very bumpy ride.

Also, we're about to go through a big smartphone slowdown which means both Apple and Qualcomm are going to cut their orders with TSMC.

Apple already cut their screen orders and paid $1 B to Samsung to do it.TSMC is the safest buy in the market right now, IMO. 

They benefit double from Intel failing — they fab for both Apple and AMD.I'm not familiar wth LSCC. Why should I look out for them?No question about it they are the only player in the game.I mean, it's not: but go on?“Is it different this time.”Yeahhh I was up $300 at the end of the day. Thought we might drop further today. Oh well. Maybe it will after the earnings and I'll get luckyThe PS5 is not the PS4, it’s made some significant leaps in ssd technology, the demos I have seen of in game footage are insane, especially the new ratchet and crank.

Also, past data is not a 100% indicator of future data, AMD up 15% at close today.

I will argue that neither the PS4/Xbox one were not that great of systems to begin with at the time, the tech from the previous systems did not advance that much outside an increase in core count and clock speed, and, they couldn’t do 4K hence the release of the pro/x series. I’m not saying it wasn’t an improvement, but it’s like putting an i7 against an i9 today.Nothing to do with the crypto boom? Now I know your're a moron, just look at the price of AMD, it was at lows for years right up until the crpyto boom starting in late 2016. [https://imgur.com/t/coffindance/0Y8Djdw](https://imgur.com/t/coffindance/0Y8Djdw)This seems like legit good news though. I thought TWTR was gonna fizzle out when that subscription rumor came out but it held fairly strong. This AMD news seems pretty good for their futureThen wait for the pop, buy puts and then sell.

EDIT: guys don't take trading advice from me. I only described what you can do if you suspect /u/boon4376's setup will play out. I can't predict the market. What I described is a play action setup. Also scalping in the first hour of the market hour is very hard. It's very volatile and you can get stopped out if you aren't careful.Just buy, wait till market close, place a sell order for more than you bought it, at open if it’s up it will closeListen to this guyOh so you mean like it did 2 days ago? Lol AMD is such a roller coaster and I love it2019 q3 was when they dropped the Ryzen 3rd Generation, right?? AMD is beating Intel in every single chip category, with the exception of a single digit % in single core performance in gaming.

Yesterday's news simply confirmed that this will be the case until 2023 at least.What are you smoking?>AMD chips still aren't competing with Intel.

couldn't be more wrong in the server space, and hell even now in the consumer space AMD chips are much more of a bargain than aging Intel 14nm tech.Intel or AMD?Well that sort of makes it sound as if both companies are at least somewhat good optionsI feel like an Intel resurgence is inevitablePeople have not noticed how bad Intel is for years, in this particular case i would definitely bet my money on bad company for a good price.Did you just call Intel a bad company? LolWhich companies are good/bad here?Wow, can't believe the i7 is that old... \*looks in mirror\* oh yeah.....A bit too much has been made of the Apple CPU change, IMHO.  It's 5% of their PC business.  It's true they'd rather retain them than lose them, but it's not a death blow.  I'd be more concerned if Dell, Lenovo, or HP ditched them.Aight thanks for the advice man. I just started learning how to trade stocks and am trying to piece together basic thinking patterns/ reasoning.Perfect call, now calm my worries and tell me it’ll be back up to $60 by late August 🙏🏻Sold ~half my AMD shares yesterday.The Ryzen 5 offering for laptops is a killer. I have one, the laptop was cheap as fuck and the CPU is blazing fast.I'm holding out hope for RISC 5. Honestly it has better potential and a lower licensing cost.This, but also don't forget AMD has a lead on APUs and significant experience with GPUs. 

They need a path forward after x86, but they're still in better shape than Intel. 

Side note: We're all focusing on AMD, but also long term hold on NYSE:TSM, which will benefit just as much from this news.no it is not, don't make me laughAnd intel's entire empire was built off the back of having the undisputed best fabs  in the world.  They often led the nearest competition by 2+ years.  Now they are 2 years behind TSMC.  It is a different world now.  AMD is only one of the companies they are losing ground to.Except those people are largely right.

Half of Intel's revenue comes from consumer PCs, with the second largest segment data centers. Everything else they do is a footnote in comparison to these two groups. Intel is *not* well diversified and this is a direct result of their failure in GPUs, mobile, wearables, selling off their modem business, losing Apple as a customer, etc. This is a company increasingly reliant on a few high margin products. If those products lose ground to AMD they are in an *incredibly* precarious position. Intel looks to be a company *in decline*.Yeah the problem is the market is flooded with people who think like this. Intel's fundamentals are very strong. Doesn't matter, AMD had a couple of good years so Intel is dead apparently>"Intel, oh, ahhhhhh, they make gaming CPUs and I know AMD doing better than them at that!"

This is ironic to me, someone in tech, because this is exactly the opposite of what's happened. Intel's reliance on monolithic die design has severely stunted their ability to compete on a core-number level. In fact, the real irony in the incorrectness of your statement is that the \*only thing Intel is leading currently\* is single threaded, high throughput gaming. Not AMD. It's a lot closer than it used to be, and I suspect AMD will overtake them in that field as well, but for now your statement is categorically and objectively wrong.Intel looks like Blackberry in 2007 right now. They have no growth story.

Even if they manage to pick up the slack and stop the hemorrhaging to AMD, Apple is about to completely change the face of the industry by switching to their own silicon, and that will bleed into PCs as Microsoft looks to compete. Five years from now the majority of laptops will be running an ARM chip.

What is Intel doing? They're investing in their own discreet GPUs, I guess, but that doesn't really seem promising at all.>Intel, oh, ahhhhhh, they make gaming CPUs and I know AMD doing better than them at that!

Given the IO, gaming is literally the most processor consuming task you can do. There are games with such high refresh rates that they make tools like CAD and Matlab look like a joke. Being able to make a chip good enough for gaming is the ultimate CPU/GPU you can think of (for retail users anyway).

Also, 90% of Intel's revenue comes from CPU market (consumer and data center- [https://www.statista.com/statistics/495928/net-revenue-of-intel-by-segment/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/495928/net-revenue-of-intel-by-segment/)), what else is Intel making from them semiconductors that we have never heard of?Indeed. They could have avoided a lot of that R&D if they just went fabless like AMD did. I mean, look at all that money spent and they're still years behind schedule on 7nm.Building market share, especially in the high margin server segment, takes a long time. The server super computers and big data centers being built today were planed years ago and the people designing them arent as quick to jump onto new and unproven tech as end users are. AMD has only been competitive for about 2 years, if they continue to turn out good products they will continue to increase their market share and that will translate into revenue.There's not a lot of competition in the sector actually (Qualcomm, Samsung and Mediatek - Huawei being kinda on the bench right now) so there was space for Intel.

And if they ever get back in making phone CPU, they'll need it very so badly.He just listed like 6 times they missed the boat.That's the thing: they missed it many, many times.>	Smart people with bad management, also those smart people may have left.

Smart people don’t stick around with bad management. It’s a lose-lose situation, either you push for change and get blamed or stay silent and suffer. Bad management wouldn’t be bad if they were able to improve.Exactly, management is key to utilizing smart people.  Look at the decline of GE, they had the smartest and brightest but failed to prune inefficiencies and doubled down on bad investments.Not when you work there.. helpConsidering the way things are now, they probably should have just done it his way.Nvidia famously has a startup culture. Wouldn't be surprised if AMD wasn't the same after they changed the CEO, or they wouldn't be able to turn around in such short few years. I think it's pretty difficult to argue that bureaucracy doesn't slow down innovation. After all, Intel fucked up the 10nm node because they tried to move faster than they could handle.Also it's way overpriced and Intel has all the tech and ifrastructure alreadyTokyo Electron, Applied Materials, Lam Research too.Eh, I think you made the right choice as you probably had reduced stressNot really, they are both on track for 3nm chips in 2022. I think the vast majority of business partners will stick with TSMC as long as they are neck to neck. I have faith in Taiwan and all the bright minds from there drool over the chance to work for them.It was just reported that Samsung is struggling with 5nm yield while TSMC is ramping up 5nm production.TSMC is building a new fab in ArizonaA leader in low power programmable chips which is a market I see growing very rapidly as we start putting chips in more and more productsVery much so. Unlike the early 2000s, Intel is now facing a 2 front war: A manufacturing process war against TSMC and x64 chip design war against AMD and as of right now, it is losing on both fronts. And TSMC is a $40 billion a year revenue juggernaut that will make it very tough for Intel to catch up to. On top of that, there is a paradigm shift in computing due to shift towards ARM architecture and AI, and Intel is simply not well positioned to tackle either.My point is that AMD has been selling chips to Sony and Microsoft for seven years and while it's certainly good news for AMD that they were selected as the vendor for the PS5/Xbox Series X that doesn't actually translate to a significant increase in revenue. They've *retained existing customers* for another console generation.You are 100% wrong. AMD's mark on the crypto space wasn't felt until late 2017, because their RX series and prior cards were inferior for the profitable algos prior to that to any Nvidia GPUs, primarily being ethash. AMD's entrance wasn't until Vega+Cryptonight pairing, a launch that  came after their resurgence. Their boom started directly with the announcement of Ryzen. 

You see, I know what I'm talking about. Do your research or GTFO.I sold my calls at the last pump so I hope it goes down and I'll buy more again. I think long term they are a really good bet.Legit good news = stock price goes down, dummy.AMD already has a bright future, but I think it is priced in already (and has been). I sold all my AMD beginning of pandemic. Missed out on some nice gains, but I also made nice gains because I got in early so no big regrets. 

I hope to buy in again when the market comes to its senses one dayDo you think it’s worth putting in calls at open? Or just to wait for it to peak tomorrow and put in some putsI’m inHonestly I forgot when they announced Ryzen 3 g. With the hinder sight, Amd sp in Nov/Dec 2019 probably had something to do with Jan 2020’s announcement of new mobile CPUs offerings, which was a very competitive product and a big surprise to me.Intel. It dropped 7% YoYJust buy the semi conductor etf. This Industry is here to stay and growing.I wouldn't hate buying both right nowThen buy Intel in 2022. It's all about the right timing.Then buy the dip. It's all about time in the market.Lol, no new desktop node in 10 years, lolTheir cpus have had many nasty security flaws in recent times. The flaws lets you read from other places in memory. This has even been possible in browsers. So yes, it comes as no shock to me that share prices are down or that Apple wants to ditch Intel. AMD is in for a serious rally if it can capture the cloud.They've had as bad a last five years as you can imagine when they had a monopoly position in x86. When you look at the other side of the aisle with Nvidia the difference in innovation culture is obvious.People will throw around AMD numbers when it involves cores and node size, but bring IPC into the equation...AMD is the good company at a bad price, Intel is the bad company at a good priceI know that feel broLenovo was showcasing AMD mobile cpu's at CES2020.

HP and Dell probably won't change, consumers care far less on power performance savings than people running huge server infrastructures.

people building Custom PC's will absolutely shop around and choose AMD at current more often than Intel.As a customer Apple is low-volume but high-margin.Im not saying there are going to go bankrupt, there are just not a great long term investment at the moment. Again, I have yet to really see them do anything new and innovative for years now, which is literally the reason why Apple dropped them outside of wanting to make the silicon for their cpus in house.Realistically, I would pick AMD and TSMC and then buy Intel when it goes a little lower for the dividend.

&#x200B;

By the way, Q1 2019 earnings for Intel was almost as bad as this report and the stock fell from $58 to $44 within a few weeks. So right now, I've set a target at $40 to start looking into buying more INTC.Sold all my AMD shares a few years ago at $2.Do you plan to buy? And if so at what value?Man, missed a pretty nice run up.[deleted]It's going to be decades before consumers migrate over to ARM - if ever. There is a dedicated mobile use-case which I support - and maybe in certain server environments where power draw is a driving factor - but I don't see the business value in switching across to ARM for every other use-case right now.Isn't it completely free to use?When you say APU do you mean integrated graphics? I think Intel beats them with tiger lake U which I think is launching really soon.That's why I invested in TSMC, but neither intel or AMDIt's more like 3 years behind TSMC at this point, but yeah.Its definately an all hands on deck situation.Their data center group is up 43% vs Q2 2019 and their PC group up 7%. Even if all of Intel grew just 7%, that would still be a great number for a company with a PE of 11.  Intel revenue is up 20% vs Q2 2019. That's astounding for an 11 PE company. Their data center group is going to make up a larger portion of their revenue every year and revenue growth as a whole will speed up.It's the way it is lol. AMD and Intel will be doing this dance even after you and I are dead. They need each other and the market needs both.You’ve also got Apple moving away from Intel. Other large companies seem to be pursuing PowerPC or ARM custom processors for servers.He putted it in quotes to suggest that's what vast majority of AMD investors think, and that's pretty true, even though it's ironic and wrong. It's not a statement he is making himself, it's an example of the idea what most investors think in regards to AMD. So dont call him out on being "objectively wrong" on something he's not claiming himself.Not on a price/ performance basis. Not many gamers are going out there buying an i9 extreme..They have a lot of bright spots.

Straight from earnings call:

"data-centric businesses grew 34%"

They also mentioned Intel edge computing which includes autonomous driving,AI, industrial automation, and edge computing.

This is going to be huge and Intel really is the only player in this market. 10 years from now it's going to be seen as a huge windfall.

AMD is nonexistent in this market, Nvidia is.

Intel is a lot of things and their desktop CPUs are a very important part, but not the whole story.

Let's wait and see what happens in 2025 before envisioning these apocalyptic scenarios.

[Quite An Interesting Read](https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4360453-intel-corporation-intc-ceo-bob-swan-on-q2-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript)

To me, that earnings call shows that Intel knows what's wrong and they are working to fix things. Self criticism is very important to success. 

BlackBerry did nothing, I find it a little annoying you would even compare Intel to them frankly.>	What is Intel doing? They’re investing in their own discreet GPUs, I guess, but that doesn’t really seem promising at all.

I had to check the calendar because I could have sworn it’s not the 00’s. Are they calling it Larrabee Next or did they decide to be less obvious about the code name? Intel is the IBM of semiconductors, same old, same old.> Five years from now the majority of laptops will be running an ARM chip.

Why would that happen now, when it didn't with the Alpha, or PowerPC chips?  It's not like there haven't been hot CPUs before, back when CPU performance mattered a heck of a lot more.

Also Apple was like 5% of the PC market.  It's a blow, but hardly a deathblow.  The real players to watch are HP, Dell, and Lenovo.Current CPUs are actually much more optimized for streaming and video editing. This is why Intel is still competitive with AMD for gaming even though AMD has way more cores. Those cores give AMD an advantage in benchmarks and in certain workloads but max single core speed is still the most important spec for gaming and that hasn’t really change for the last 5 years or more and Intel still has an edge on AMD.

I would argue that ROM and RAM have also stagnated since SSDs became widely available 5 years. Sure you could eek out 5% gains on certain games with high speed RAM but in the process you end up with way worse stability.

GPUs on the other hand have been improving in gaming performance 20% YoY, which is why I usually recommend that PC builders put half their budget to their GPU.IDK, they give up a LOT of control by going fabless.  AMD took a big gamble when they sold off their fabs, a lot of people in the industry wrote them off when it happened, and their stock price dropped to $2.  Definitely paid off for them, but there are serious advantages to having your own fab, which is why Intel has been able to do so much with their older fabs.Explain?^SameThat's not really how people or companies work though at all.Totally agree. The executives, but likely not the engineers, are seemingly steering the ship ashore. From afar, it looks like Intel, collectively, got complacent and rested on their laurels — and now it looks like it's coming back to haunt them.Intel has about 10x the employees of either NVidia or AMD, but that has not changed much in the past 20 years, and yet in the past couple of years they've been struggling.

https://notesmatic.com/2018/08/intel-corporation-number-of-employees/Agreed.  Might have made more sense a few years ago when the stock was at $2-3.Definitely reduced stress but I had coworkers who got a 2000% return investing in AMD. They quit their job ... coincidence?That's cool and all, but remember that TSMC was always  1-2 steps behind Intel until... it suddenly wasn't.Which won't be online for a while.How is the shift to ARM explaining AMD going up, again?

Furthermore. Intel's product line this year was always about 10nm. They've accelerated this process utilization. Somehow, everyone is up in arms about a process that was always going to launch 2021 earliest.

Intel can always use TSMC just like AMD does. "AMD uses TSMC" is not a competitive advantage of AMD over Intel.Fair enough, I just see the 50% increase in production as really good news for both sony and AMD considering the state of the world right now, unless earnings really disappoint I plan on holding for quite some time since revenue growth has a nice clean trend up.If you can predict the peak than yes. It's predicting the peak that's hard. I'm not convinced it will peak tomorrow and drop.Which one?They have already had that rally.> Their cpus have had many nasty security flaws in recent times.

AMD has many of the same issues, and yet it's stock has been on a tear...Then AMD still leads in the desktop and server markets, with mobile Ice Lake's lower clocks undermining their IPC improvements. Outside of the rare software that can actually heavily utilize AVX512 AMD trails in exactly 2 areas: max clocks and cache latency.

As it so happens Milan is due out shortly and should address the latter while significantly boosting IPC (whether it addresses max clocks is TBD).A 70b company is bad and a 6b company is good?Intel is NOT a bad company. The only segment AMD is winning is gaming machines. Intel ain’t going anywhere.All three currently have AMD processors for sale, none of them are doing so as the default.  This is very different from them completely dropping Intel like Apple did.  Instead it's going to be a slow erosion of profits.  Intel still has a better brand than AMD, at least for most people.  

I'd agree with you that the enthusiast market is all AMD, just check this thread.  :)5% is 5%I disagree.  They still own the market, they're still a massive company, and right now they're trading at a significant discount.  

https://www.cpubenchmark.net/market_share.html

AMD/NVidia are poor investments atm, even if they do have an edge in product, because their stock prices are too high for little improvement they're showing.  AMD at P/E 167 is very expensive, really the only way they can go is down, even if it's going to take time.  NVidia has an only slightly less nose-bleed cost at 76 P/E.  Honestly TSMC is a far better investment than either AMD or NVidia.

Gamers are not really the market either, but even then Intel still has the fastest single threaded CPU, which is going to have more impact on game performance.  

Not that it really matters.  People installing i9 or ryzen 9 series are not a significant portion of the market.  A significant portion of the market are you mom and dad, and the bank down the street, and the boring insurance agency who needs something for their secretary.

I mean I get it, I've got an AMD in the PC I just built, but that's more because I like the price/performance ratio and any idea that there's some amazing difference between the two chips.

Further I've seen this movie a few times.  Intel makes a mistake, screws up, AMD eats their lunch for a while.  The did it with the Atholon, they beat Intel to 64 bits.  Then Intel comes back and is top dog for a while, rinse repeat.Interesting. Good stuff to know hmm I have never heard of TSMC before and just learned that it's an international stock which I guess I can't get since I use Robinhood mainly and am transitioning to Charles Schwab brokerage next week but they're both US based sadly. I'll keep an eye on AMD for sure and see what Intel is up to.Good point. INTC been around $44 during 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. Might as well wait for the dip.It better just make $61 by late August 🙏🏻[removed]Yep for sure... still have plenty and netted a 100+% profit on what I sold, I'll live.YesI wouldn’t be so sure until we see how Apple chips perform. If they are as good as the hype, I could imagine an ARMs race.Yup and you can add any extensions you want to add functionality.APU is AMD’s name for a CPU + GPU on the same substrate. Intel doesn’t have a separate name for them. 

While I am hopeful for Intel’s Tiger Lake products and their new graphics architecture... we shall see what these products look like in their final form come launch day.Tiger Lake is Intel's attempt to get back to iGPU performance parity with AMD, we'll see if it's successful.$TSMAt this point why would data centers keep buying Intel instead of AMD? Do they like security issues and paying more for less efficient chips that they run 24/7?These mofos see Intel miss step for 1 year and they think the story is over.

&#x200B;

After Tesla fanboys, these AMD guys really are the worst lmaoThe Goku and Vegeta of the chip making business> You’ve also got Apple moving away from Intel.

Apple's move away from Intel is mostly hype.  They were like 5% of the PC market, and mostly a niche player.  What would be more worrisome is if HP, Dell, or Lenovo moved to AMD or ARM exclusively.  They're not going to do that, because most people are not enthusiasts.  The mom and pop and pointy haired boss crowd all think AMD is a value brand.Apple really doesn’t manufacture many computers at all in the grand scheme of things. It makes next to no difference for IntelUnfortunately, a variety of relatively comparable Intel parts can be found [here](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/singleThread.html), with better single threaded performance than their AMD price-rivals. If you look at some of the i5 line (particularly the 9th gen KF parts), you'll see that the performance/price metric actually places Intel further ahead by a wide margin in single-core performance.

To reiterate - I think that AMD is a better value in overall terms. However, this does not invalidate the fact that your statement on single threaded performance is objectively incorrect.> Why would that happen now, when it didn't with the Alpha, or PowerPC chips? It's not like there haven't been hot CPUs before, back when CPU performance mattered a heck of a lot more.

Not sure what you mean. I don't know the full history of PPC/Alpha but that is essentially what happened with Intel. Apple switched to Intel in the first place because it was so much better at power per watt than PPC.

I can't remember exactly but a few years back some OEMs were making ARM Windows laptops with 24 hour + battery life. Obviously, Windows on ARM wasn't and still isn't ready, but the value prop of that battery gain was huge. Now that Apple is moving in that direction, I would be very surprised if Microsoft didn't get more serious about pushing ARM Windows.>Also Apple was like 5% of the PC market.  It's a blow, but hardly a deathblow.  The real players to watch are HP, Dell, and Lenovo.

Who all have very strong amd offeringsThe joke is probably that you wouldn't find cutting throats very interesting when it's your own throat on the line. Litterally.That has more to do with AMD being complete crap than Intel doing well though. Also, sub-micron fabrication is a lot easier than sub-nm fabrication. The amount of innovation needed to achieve sustainable improvement right now is a lot higher than it did before.Haha I had an old co-worker who bought AMD at $2 and sold at $13 thinking he made out like a banditI don't know how long OP plan on staying invested in TSMC but I'm personally not so I can't say for sure. As far as the current road map is concerned though, I don't see any major road block that'll stop TSMC from dominating the fab business.>How is the shift to ARM explaining AMD going up, again?

AMD is a still a niche player and gaining market share over that niche. Intel is a computing mainstream player and the shift to ARM is shrinking its mainstream dominance. Plus AMD has an AI play with its GPU and an ARM play with its GPU partnership with Samsung. Intel does not.

>Intel can always use TSMC just like AMD does.

They sure can, but that will affect their margins. And a lot of Intel's value came from the fact that they were ahead of the rest of the industry in terms of fabrication. By switching to TSMC they go from historicaly being ahead in terms of processes to going to parity with the rest of the industry on a permanent basis.SMHNot really. Meltdown is significantly worse than Spectre and it only affects Intel chips (and some arm). This combined with the pretty terrible response from Intel (lots of bugs related to their rushed patches) really made them seem amateurish compared to amd.One is expected to grow and the other is expected to shrink/stagnateYes, because their market cap is not the same, so you can't expect the same incomeActually, Intel is a 260 billion $ company.

&#x200B;

NVM, you meant CF.I agree that Intel is not a bad company, but AMD is winning in more than just gaming machines and has a lot more room for growth than Intel.AMD is winning in Single Threaded, multithreaded, core count, power efficiency, yield, ipc, gaming, synthetic benchmarks, IO bandwidth, PCIE Speed, and CPU security.   The only thing it is behind  in is pure frequency but that is tied to the architecture and absolutely meaningless on it's own without taking into account IPC. I would even say that the only thing INTEL had on AMD was gaming before the launch of Zen 2. After Zen 2 intel has nothing left.  I have a 9900K i9 from launch and I would absolutely not have bought that if AMD had the 3950X or 3900X out at the time.AMD has HEDT on lockdown, has very formidable mobile, makes progress in server.

What happens when Ice Lake server is not better than 14nm? They will just try to push AVX512?

In fact gaming is the only sector Intel hasPreachWhat's the 5% of? 5% of revenue isn't the same as 5% of profit.Hmm, you actually raise some good points. 

Either way, I’m happy with the current pump I’m in and will most likely sell after earnings.Where are you at? UK?Uh you can buy TSMC on Robinhood.

On the other side there are enormous hurdles to overcome for the migration, so it's not as if we can expect this to occur organically. Additionally, if Apple is the only OEM with with decent ARM chips, Linux and Windows will stay with x64. Since they comprise the vast majority of server, consumer desktop and laptop, and business desktop and laptop, software will stay with x64 for a very long time.

I think we're far more likely to see a shift to SaaS in multiple segments with a thin-client approach on even traditionally thick-client environments.

DoubleliftuuInstitutional investments. They bought into Intel a long time ago, and they've got buyer pipelines and customized code investments that outweigh the efficiency gap.AmenPeople like you are the worst. AMD is doing an amazing job just like tesla. I dont own any AMD stock but I can see that they are doing a better job than intel at the moment. You can call them the worst but they have clearly out performed the market by looking at the future instead of the past/present. They never say that intel is dead or anything. They just are just saying that AMD is beating intel big time at the moment, which is definitly true.Why are you so angry?If Apple laptops suddenly start having better performance and better battery life because of the move to ARM then the other manufacturers may be forced to follow suit. The cheapest iPhone is (was?) faster than the most expensive Android. I vaguely recall Microsoft experimenting with ARM on the Surface line of laptops already.They didn’t make cell phones until 2007, and now they control a significant market share. I’m not going to bet against it.Intels server CPU are more expensive and slower and this is the cash cow of Intel. Then there are the CPU for laptops and AMD seems to be capable to deliver cheaper CPU which are faster in modern applications. The gamer scene is complete uninteresting because the market is so small.yea but they have less threads at the same price level.

single thread performance matters only in Gaming, and games are not bottle necked in FPS by CPUs they are bottle necked in GPUs which Nvidia and AMD both have a larger share of.

GPUs matter more for AI as well where Nvidia is killing it in the TPU space.

we all need to face the facts that if your not building the highest spec gaming PC you are going to be choosing AMD CPUs on price/performance and Nvidia GPUs.

high single core speed means fuck all for 80% of Gamers who are building new machines that will run any game just fine and spend most of their money on the graphics card. Most people would rather have more threads and cores at the same price point to be able to multitask better.Didn't know that was still not true. I haven't really been into gaming since 2017.> Not sure what you mean. I don't know the full history of PPC/Alpha but that is essentially what happened with Intel. Apple switched to Intel in the first place because it was so much better at power per watt than PPC.

That's what Steve said, but honestly there was a lot more to it that didn't make for a good presentation.  PowerPC was IBM, and they were struggling to make the transition to 90 nm.  Yields were down, prices were up.  (And Jobs was never going to say to Apple buyers "we're buying the cheaper alternative").  Further the PowerPC was a dead architecture, and never had the kind of buy in that the x86 architecture has.  PowerPC was pretty much Apple, and IBM mainframes, not a massive, growing market, or at least one of the size necessary to play the fab upgrade game.

A 24 hour laptop battery is even less necessary than a 24 hour phone battery.  Most people use the laptop for 8-10 hours a day, and then plug it in, assuming they unplugged it in the first place.  Having battery support that extends longer than that is unnecessary, since people will just plug it in.

What really does matter is what software is supported, and right now that's the x86 instruction set.  Apple might be able to get people to switch, since there are far fewer applications for MacOS, most of which are in house, but it's not the same on Windows, where people (and businesses) want/need to run software from 5-10 years ago.  Particularly bad in business, where you've got some goofy app the CEO's kid wrote 5 years ago, and controls half the functions of the business.  :)

The move to browsers helps with this transition quite a bit, but for serious applications the browser still isn't quite there, because it has to go back to the server every time it needs a new bit of data.It's definitely shifted, but look who's the default for those manufacturers?  And have any of them stopped using Intel?  There's a difference between Apple's complete stop, and the major PC manufacturers offering AMD processors.Yeah, to be honest I don’t know if this coworker sold, but they did buy in that same range and seemed to be a true believer (he said he was “all in”)Am I your old coworker? I had 1500 shares average under $3.. I traded in and out the whole way up which was very lucrative, but doing the math I’d have been better off sitting on my hands and letting her gain. I’m a better investor for it now.You're explaining the psychology of AMD/INTC investors very well, but the facts and numbers don't match that psychology at all.

AMD and Intel were founded 1 year apart in the late 60s. AMD isn't this brand new Tesla-type startup that's growing from a niche player to mainstream.

They've both been around, and Intel knows how to play the x86 game. Their shared problem is that the x86 market as a whole is shrinking.

The GPU is not a unique advantage here.  It doesn't compete with Intel on that ground, but with everyone. The x86 patents don't matter, it's full of GPU makers. Apple doesn't seem to mind making their own for ex. 

AMD has somehow maintained this "underdog" status forever... because they always underperform, and they always look like they're getting ahead, but they never do. Check the stock market price of AMD on weekly bars. It's had two major booms and busts based on the same thesis you just outlined. How they gon' overtake Intel and what not.

And we're in a third boom.

We have three things that are "different this time": vastly underestimated recession/depression gaining momentum, the monetary policy helping inflate the bubble, and the fact the x86 advantage is turning into a disadvantage. None of those are actually good for AMD's longterm prospects.

You just need to look at the P/E of both companies and realize Intel is way undervalued and AMD is hilariously overvalued. Yeah this can keep going for a little bit more. Maybe. But I feel this ER will be the start reality returning to AMD.I’m also disappointed> Meltdown is significantly worse than Spectre and it only affects Intel chips (and some arm).

Sure, but there seems to be this attitude that AMD did not have these problems, and they did.

Also most of this is hype, since there have been no malware reported in the wild, and most people aren't bothering to patch because it doesn't matter.  Do you think that most PC buyers even know what those exploits are?They produce more than just CPUs like network cards.
Most of the production network cards are Intel.
More than 50%

I'm looking to wait a year or two at least to see this out.  I might break even, or lose a bit, but I doubt Intel is going away anytime soon.Turns out I was wrong and it's TSM not TSMC. Can get it now yayYeah you're right, I was looking for TSMC and couldn't find it and turns out its TSM.Yup that's why I was confused why I couldn't find it. Thank you!So mobile is already there, servers and cloud are being pushed there by economics, and apple is onboard now too.  That leaves PCs.  The majority of those are actually laptops, where low power directly translates into small size and long battery life like mobile.  I don't see desktop PCs being some kind of a lone holdout.  Recent surface tablets are ARM so I don't think Windows itself will be a problem.  Linux runs on everything under the sun including all of the servers and mobile devices above.

I don't see x86 going away completely and I expect it will hang on longest in legacy business type applications.  But I do expect a shift in the wider industry and as you mentioned, as CPUs become less important to most consumers they will become more commoditized which favors architectures like ARM with multiple suppliers.Linux isn't staying anything... There are several Arm based distros and software compiled for it. Windows is the only OS that needs to add ARM support. If they made a build with X86 emulation Intel and AMD would have a serious problem on their hands.C9 for life!> customized code investments

Well here’s the thing: x86-64 isn’t even an Intel invention, it was AMD. Yeah Intel has some optimizing compilers (that almost no one uses) SIMD extensions (that AMD has adopted as well), virtualization extensions, some things like Quicksync video, etc, but for the most part there isn’t much of a moat.And as the years go buy that will evaporate. Intel is multiple years behind catching AMD and it doesn't look like that is gonna change anytime soon. Stocks are about looking ahead not behind and the outlook for Intel is not good. IBM is a better investment over Intel at this point.>They bought into Intel a long time ago,

And how long ago do you think they started to plan to move off Intel due to the many Intel specific security issues that are especially dangerous for data centers?

>and customized code investments that outweigh the efficiency gap.

The _current_ efficiency gap. I'm sure they see the writing on the wall and they'd be idiots to not have started a plan to move to AMD when the efficiency gap becomes too wide to ignore.> If Apple laptops suddenly start having better performance and better battery life because of the move to ARM then the other manufacturers may be forced to follow suit. 

How would they show it?  Serious question, since Apple has their own OS, it's difficult to compare to Windows based PCs in either category.  Just so many moving parts that effect performance.  Further, from what I can tell performance is not a priority for Apple users, since their PCs and laptops have historically lagged and been slow to refresh.

> The cheapest iPhone is (was?) faster than the most expensive Android. I vaguely recall Microsoft experimenting with ARM on the Surface line of laptops already.

Microsoft has support for ARM in Windows, just like they had support for Alpha, Itanium and PowerPC back in the day.  Generally it doesn't matter much, since most people don't want to go through the hassle of switching all their current software over to a new processor.  It's a bit easier to switch than it used to be, with everything on the web, and far fewer hw peripherals but it's still a pain.Bet against what?So then why the fuck are you pretending to be an authority on it?These manufacturers will never stop using both companies processers. Apple will release maybe 2 or 3 laptops a year, and I doubt even that: they can only afford to use one brand. The other oems release tens, maybe hundreds of models per generation, they can easily afford to span the price range and keep the good will of the CPU manufacturers by using both brandsYou are way exaggerating by saying x86 market is shrinking and computing is shifting to ARM. On mobile computing, yes. On high performance computing, no.people don't patch cpu firmare, OS vendors do, so it's automatically done via update mechanisms through things like windows, or linux distributions.

Of course most people don't understand those exploits, that's not really the issue.  They're concerning if you're say a cloud or shared computing vendor and want to keep your infrastructure secure so one client cant read information from another, if you had projects in the pipeline for leveraging secure computing resources on those processors that are now impossible to trust, or if you just lost 10-30% of your compute per core mitigating the exploits those patches addressed.  All of those were largely intel only problems because they were a different level of severity on intel chips.Sure, but what percentage of their revenue comes from network cards?Because console sales are down right now. After they launch they will have record earnings.Yes, Intel has done great in recent years, but their projections for the future call for stagnation.What a time to be aliveLMAO, If the stock is a crowded trade, has momentum, and the chart goes up it is a good company.

SEE CALIFORNIA AND IT'S HOUSING MARKET. SEE ALL OF THESE DUMB HYPE STOCKS.Yes. If you noticed, bad companies always have much lower PE ratios than good companies.200 pe is trailing. It's been pricing in the console launch for about two years now.>Cloud computing moves markets. Intel owns that business.

For now. They will start to replace their chips with AMD over time, there's no reason not to, they're cheaper, more efficient, faster and have fewer security problems.Companies choosing between AMD and Intel have no reason to choose intel. They don’t give a damn about past performance of the stock.

One of the biggest costs of a data center is electricity costs. Given enough efficiency companies wouldn’t use Intel over AMD even if intel was supplying them parts for FREE.Cloud computing platforms are switching or adding options to use AMD EPYC servers (which are often cheaper for the same vCPU IIRC). AMD processors are actually better suited to data center needs and usages right now, it's just that switching out machines/platforms in data centers for cloud providers isn't a fast process. [See here.](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/amd/).

IMO, Intel wins out only in gaming (if you're to consider just the strength of their processors vs AMD at the same price point).

Obviously Intel produces more than just processors; their WiFi chips are industry leading AFAIK (just to name one). I would say though that their current x86 processor outlook isn't too hot.That... and everything else. I don't see a reason to buy Intel anymore in any segment, besides having the fastest possible gaming PC because Intel sells a higher clocked i9 than AMD's offerings.Apple also recently announced they’re moving away from intel, to their own custom ARM chipsets. They’re going to be able to come out with insane battery life laptops, and then if others want to compete on that they’re going to have to ditch intel for some product lines or do *something*. Microsoft will probably see an uptick in interest around their ARM surface books too as ARM becomes a more supported/adopted platform for laptops. I think this trend alone is a huge deal.

Sony and Microsoft are almost ready to release their next gen consoles, both based on AMD.

AMD also grew its server market share in the last couple of years, going from basically nothing at about 10% which is pretty crazy. Their offering is really attractive to data centers at the moment as they’re often winning on power efficiency, performance, and core count per dollar. Looks like that’s gonna be true for at least a little while now.

Big cloud providers like AWS used to be a total monopoly that intel had a death grip over, but now it’s being broken up too. There have been loads of new AMD based instance classes offered over the past year or so, and AWS are even now producing their own custom ARM chips and offering them as alternative to intel.

Intel isn’t really even in the GPU market and this is pretty much owned by AMD/Nvidia who are constantly making good progress.

And now Intel have shat the bed again with production issues.

It feels like a bit of a perfect storm for them. The longer term trends aren’t so obviously in-line with their core competencies anymore, they’re losing ground to AMD, and their big partners (Apple, AWS, etc) are reducing their dependence on intel and simultaneously competing with them.Not only does AMD have better yields using TSMC than intel. AMD has hugely better yields than intel even if they both used the same process on TSMC. This is one of the major advantages AMD chiplet design provides. This means AMD can achieve better yields and produce chips at lower cost than intel even after TSMC takes their cut. This also mean AMD can deliver in volume on massive core count chips.

If intel wanted to get into a pricing war with AMD they might as well be flushing that money down the drain. 

The cloud computing provider shift to AMD has already been set in motion. By the time intel can react the landscape will have already shifted significantly.>Oh, Intel is doing better on yield? When they don't even have fabs?

Do you mean AMD? If so, yes.

>And if you are talking about Global Foundries...they are a joke, please read up on them, they are 2 years behind Intel...

AMD is using TSMC. That's one of the advantages of AMD, they can switch fabs when needed.Same, I’m going to be watching for some good newsYes, they get thrown around.Yeah customized code pretty much pales in comparison to the costs of documentation, peripheral hardware, and peripheral services. I do think that people that primarily interact with processors through a consumer standpoint hugely underestimate the inertia of big purchasing/business though. It's not just "buy the cheap one" it's "get a sample, wait, test the sample, wait, submit it for approval, wait, get a change order in, wait, shelve the project, wait, fill the old orders, wait, get some new ones in, wait, work out the kinks, wait, document the change, wait, officially buy the cheap one". And I probably missed a few steps and some waiting.No it won't. Institutional investments don't get smaller with time, they grow. AMD has to provide a significant enough price/performance gap to overcome the future of platform lock in. And Intel doesn't have to catch up to AMD, they have to catch up to TSM. AMD is fabless; they don't own or operate the 5nm technology that Intel is struggling to catch up to.>How would they show it?

Battery life

CPU usage when performing equivalent tasks (Office, web browsing etc.)

Performance doing equivalent things (time to load an application that will be cross platform like Spotify, or load a web page)> How would they show it?

Reviews, custom satisfaction, reinforcement of the premium brand. Apple removes a headphone jack - pretty much all phones follow. Removal of the headphone jack allowed them to do better water proofing. The switch to ARM may allow them to do a lot around performance and battery life compared to what they could accomplish with Intel.Bet against Intel slowly being nibbled away at by a move from x86 to ARM or PPC.Lol that's what people here do.

Never is a very long time, but I feel like we're in violent agreement here.  If Intel or AMD falls behind significantly this might change, but not anytime soon.Sorry but your opinion is past expiration date.

ARM is making significant headway in cloud computing / servers, and Apple just announced they're moving all their laptops/desktops to ARM.

Finally this is all going away as new processors come out.  It's mostly an issue for old, already sold processors.People have been saying this for two console generations. Its minuscule business. MSFT reported record gaming revenue.That has to do with investor education. The general investor just knows brand names. They have no clue how to look at a the balance sheet and income statements. THAT'S THE REASON MOST TRADERS FAIL. Learn to buy bargains and sell when fundamentals don't match price.The console launch is going to 20x profit? Oh wowand CPU's are not the bottleneck in gaming PC, its all about graphics cards.

People in this thread acting like Intel is the company of yester year and not the company struggling with innovation and having their market share taken brick by brick in the server space.

Death by a thousand cuts is how I describe Intel's future outlook. Still a good buy opportunity if they can turn it around.Apple doesn’t make up a lot of Intel business.Yes, Intel is moving to chiplet as well, that was definitely a smart move for AMD.RemindMe! 2 years "A civil discussion about AMD vs Intel"Well I agree with you there, and it explains their strong data center performance and why that growth might even continue for years and mask underlying long term weakness.Platform lock in will only take you so far. Intel is flailing right now with no end in sight. If Intel is still behind 5-10 from now Intels lead will vanish.Yeah, but that's the point.  There are a LOT of moving parts that make this sort of comparison difficult on PC with similar CPUs, ARM is going to be a whole different beast.> Reviews, custom satisfaction, reinforcement of the premium brand.

Not really what I was talking about.  You're doing a review, how do you show that the improvement in battery life is a result of the new CPU, and not the motherboard, ethernet/wifi, screen, USB, HDD/SSD, GPU, or the battery itself?

Apple has also made a number of changes that industry does not follow.  They're half the phone industry, but a niche player in the PC/Laptop industry.Let’s agree to disagree here. Wake me up when aws’s ARM instances are selling, :-)Are you a computer scientist because I really don't believe you have any idea what you're talking aboutBut it's in addition to server, desktop, HEDT, graphics, mobile wins.I applaud the nonstop wreckage you've dealt this AMD fanboy. When you show them analysis they shut the fuck up.No, but AMD is launching the Zen 2 APUs to increase OEM market share. This traditionally was a an area that Intel dominated in. But for cheap prebuilts with no dGPU now AMD has the edge with 4, 6, 8 core machines. These will be great for office machines, as AMD has good performance for the price. They should also have a hidden bonus, they can run memory faster than the chiplets so they may have a small boost in gaming with a dGPU. But that's to be seen.

Then AMD is launching Zen 3 CPUs without an iGPU. These should have 8 core CCXs, increased IPC. This should beat Intel in gaming. The 4 core single CCX 3300x already matches the 7700K. Zen 3 4700x should match or even surpass the 9900K in gaming.

Zen 3 will also come with a new generation of faster servers, maybe a Threadripper refresh (HEDT). Although AMD is so far ahead in HEDT that would be a victory lap. These are very high margin parts, compared to desktop and semi-custom.

AMD is also launching "Big Navi" that is rumored to be better than the current best GPU 2080Ti. But Nvidia is also launching something at the same time. So we'll have to see which one is going to be better. I predict Ampere will be faster, but more expensive. Big Navi will, however, increase margins.

Then in 2021 AMD launches Zen 3 mobile parts. Better gaming performance comes to gaming laptops where AMD is already tied with Intel in performance. AMD will sell more premium SKUs, and launch more SmartBoost combos with Navi 2 GPUs which will be better than any current laptops, but will have stiff Nvidia competition. But they will still sell a lot of Nvidia laptops with AMD CPUs in them!

Moving on, they will be making phone GPUs to compete with Adreno, have supercomputing wins, and increase console margins. Apparently consoles have terrible margins on launch (so 2020), but stay the same and sell for about the same the next year while manufacturing scales. TSMC is still what, in the second year of making 7nm? It will get cheaper, and yields will improve.

These are significant tailwinds for AMD. I would not be surprised if AMD doubled their top line within the next two years.There is more to a company than the Next quarters Earnings report. Intel just has a way of padding the earnings reports as it slowly sinks. Shortsightedness by Intel will destroy the company technologically first and financially later.I see people do this all the time, is this a bot or something? LolI think it also buys them time to solve their current process issues. Sure, it looks bad in the press, but a huge, huge part of sales is customer-client relations, and Intel still has the first mover bias there. It takes a lot to lose that.Platform lock in is a fixed cost in the short term that increases in the long term. Ignoring buyer irrationality, it only makes sense to change components when the marginal performance gain outweighs the cost of changing. If Intel remains as behind as it is now and computing power remains as valuable as it is now, that decision does not change. Intel has to lose ground or computing power has to become more valuable at a rate that *exceeds the increase in platform lock in*.No,  not really, not at all in fact.

Every generation of iPhones come with Apple's custom ARM designs, but it still gets compared to Qualcomm and Samsung chips when Android phones launch.

Comparisons include battery life, CPU benchmarks and performance using similar apps.

It isn't difficult at all.WAKE UPYes, and it will send you an email in X amount of time about the thread.  I like it for keeping track of things I found interesting, but have a time element, that I don't want to forget about.> Every generation of iPhones come with Apple's custom ARM designs, but it still gets compared to Qualcomm and Samsung chips when Android phones launch.

All three processors are ARM based, which is like comparing AMD to Intel.  Very different comparing ARM to x86.
  
> Comparisons include battery life, CPU benchmarks and performance using similar apps.

Right, but they're comparing the entire system at that point.  I agree with you that they talk about battery life, which is critical with a cell phone, but they seldom put it all on the CPU.  Further cell phone are much more uniform in their power drains than a PC.

Apple is going to release a laptop, not just a CPU.  It's going to have a number of differences that aren't just the CPU.  It's also going to be the GPU, RAM, HDD/SDD, Screen, Battery, Wifi/Ethernet, speakers, etc.  All those moving parts effect battery life and performance.**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

It all depends on your job, but a bear market will certainly lead to reduced earnings for a chunk of the working population. 

And obviously this isn’t factoring in reduced employment opportunities, which would come with a bear market. 

But yes, it would be pretty awesome if the market was low for 40 years and then shoot up 10000% the year before you retire and after 40 years of massive accumulation.My wages comes in once a month but markets keep becoming more expensive to buyI am 32, only started getting serious about my life and financial security in the past two years or so.  It's disgusting but I am sort of hoping for a downturn in this market so I can buy as much as I can with my savings over the next few years and hopefully set myself up for some long-term gains.It’s nice and all but with the recession came my pay reduction. Now I don’t have the money to invest like I did before. My only thought is paying the bills not the market.You are absolutely correct.  I lost a bunch in 2001-2004 but continued my investing and contribution to my 401k and lost a double bunch in 07-09, but stayed invested in growth stocks mostly even a bit past the time I should have gone more into bonds, but needed to.  Again continued maxing the 401k and other outside investing and that continued investing which was really nothing more than buying stocks when they were historically cheap allowed me and others to make up our losses from the Dot Com bubble and the Great Recession.  The bad thing for you youngsters would have the market be high when you start, stay high for years and then drop just as you were getting ready to retire.   So you would have years of buying expensive stock and than have to sell into a lower priced stock market early in retirement when you want to be buying lake houses and taking cruises.Because bear markets are the result of potentially very scary scenarios.  We haven’t “broken” yet, but each time there’s a major crash there is the risk we never recover.  It’s emotionally taxing for young and old alike.  I would not root for a bear market, eventually one may hit that we don’t recover from.The best possible scenario is for there to be a bear market while your income goes up.

If you can somehow secure a role where you’re income rises during a bear market and you maintain employment and cashflow, yes everyone under 45 would tremendously benefit.

That said, even better is inheriting boomer wealth for the <35 year old. It’s a bullet proof plan.You could've invested on the top of every market prior to massive drops (1973, 1987, 1999, 2007, and 2020) and still make money.Why you would want either a bull or bear market anyway? It’s not like we can do anything about it. Might as well just focus on how to make money irrespective of positive or negative outlook in my opinionTotally agree, the flip side of high prices is low returns.  As somebody who has gone through two recessions and extended periods of financial repression it sucks to be a saver.

Plus I feel like using high asset prices to support a positive consumer sentiment to keep the music playing is losing its effect.  At this point, its like housing prices are too high, stocks are too high, might as well cut spending because I am going to have to work forever anyway.I graduated college in 2008 and the bear market at the time torpedoed my career growth.  That's why.I dont want long and deep. I want what we had before in march but much lower and then a quick recovery so I can buy and hold this timeI was doing some simulations the other day of 40 year returns DCA the SP500. I plotted expected annual returns against a few different CAPE measures. 1. CAPE when you start investing; 2. average CAPE over the entire 40 years; 3. CAPE value at the 40th year. #3 explained almost all the differences in returns. If you are 100% in stocks you really want the market to be overpriced when you sell. It doesn't matter so much where they were as you bought in.

If you are interested, I can try to find the plots and share.Because I want the new iPhone to come out.  Because I want new electric cars to be developed.

Bear markets exist because people expect progress (ie economic development) to slow or halt.10 years of a stagnant market would mean that your first $100 might be worth $100 at the end of those 10 years. Does anything about that sound appealing?I'm 32 and feel 52, nice to read I might actually be considered young.

I hear ya, I'm holding 70% of my account in cash and waiting for a dip. Hard to say I'm wanting a dip because of the hardship that comes with it. It would affect my day job... But I kind of want a dip. I'm a bad man.But there’s no way to tell how high the price of $SPY would’ve been if the deep bear market didn’t occur so it’s impossible to compare. If we didn’t have any recessions in the past 20 years, I would think $SPY would be much higher right now. I just hope there isn’t a deep recession when it’s time to retire.This is an interesting chart to read, remember and try to understand.

The markets do go up more than they go down, but also a solid run up normally as a pull back soon after.   The most recent is the late 90's pulling back in the early 00's.  But as you can see most green candles up are followed by one or more red candles down.  It is how you handle both the good and the bad over time that makes you a success or a failure.Slowdown. Take a page from Nikkei and read about it. Nikkei was from inflated housing/assets crisis and so the assets that are being valued now. My house valuation went up by 13% in three months.

What the economy is doing now and what QE has done may yield in some long term damage when coupled with some strong political reasons from China.

US was built based on oil dollars and now its being built based on tech. But some of them are not feeling alright when you can offload your job to elsewhere totally remote.Yeah, I prefer panic....always made the biggest gains during major panic attacks.You do actually, assuming you don't lose a job or anything.

Read the all time classic 4 Pillars of Investing by Dr. Bernstein.  Young people who are able to invest when the market craters make out better over the long run.As opposed to what, steady economic growth? Prolonged bull market? How perfectly would you want to time the bottom?

I think what you're getting at is since you're young, you won't have invested much prior to the bear market, and therefore you could easily bring your cost basis down. I also think you're assuming a roaring recovery.

The market was just starting to hit alltime highs after the 2001 dotcom bubble, and then 2008 hit. All else equal, I don't see how those events we're desirable unless you were Michael Burry.I’m 20 with 35k invested. I guess bear market presents a buying opportunity but I’d rather live in an infinite bull market (won’t happen). I invest my net savings every month so I don’t have much cash to invest if a crash happens. I guess I could use marginit depend where you work ? your company may lay you off do to the deep bear marketSounds like you are buying Enron.I work in hospitality and my salary was cut 20%.because your job and salary will be significantly lower in your highest earning years then they otherwise would be, giving you significantly less money to earn over your entire life, resulting in you living in lower income areas then you otherwise would, have worse outcomes for not only your financial well being, but your health, your future children's education, and as a result their potential earnings over their lives.

seriously ?In general, it's nearly impossible to correctly time the market. Time in the market prevails over timing the market. 

The market crashed during March because of the uncertain future of Covid, but I don't think a crash of similar magnitude will happen again. As for long-term gains, investing in Index funds using Dollar-cost-averaging strategy would be the easiest way for an average investors, since the market tends to go up in the long run (whether it crashes in the foreseeable future or not). Of course, it's always beneficial to keep cash, in case a good opportunity arises.

P.S. I'm also someone who got serious about investing just recently.BuT jApAnI'm interested.Ooh, I'm interested :)You just had the fastest dip in the history of the market and you're...waiting for a dip???2008 worked out amazing for the folks just a couple years older than me.

Explain what you mean by this?   Do you mean this year or ever?Thanks for the advice, I always appreciate getting insight where I can.  Financial aptitude wasn't something I was exposed to growing up.  

Right now, I'm contributing to my 401k up to my employer's match so I'm not completely out of the market.  Outside of that, I've been saving money in an account just for a rainy day.  I think I am going to put that into the market in the near future after some paper trading experience to see how I do before I go gamble it away.

I am not too risky so I was thinking of putting something like 70-80 percent in an index fund and using the rest for picking stocks I like personally and having some fun...and hopefully some gains.And China. Shanghai index isn't even anywhere close to its 2008 highs despite China's GDP and technology supposedly growing at a strong rate.Just made a post in investing on it.

You mean, another crash ?? I can't speak for the 'ever' part, but as for this year, I don't think such a significant crash will happen again. March crash happened because there was incredible uncertainty in the future of the economy. Now, there's some certainty that the big businesses would survive the pandemic, and so the stocks continue to rally.Sounds like you are off to a great start.  Too many people skip the paper trading step.

The /r/personalfinance prime directive is pretty great too for helping you prioritize things, especially while you are getting started:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics)I fully expect a decline of that magnitude to hit the US at some point. Bull markets never last forever and anyone thinking they will just because we're the US is fooling themselves. Just have to hope it isn't during my retirement.Why didn't you deploy any cash during the last dip?  It sounds like you have no idea what a "dip" actually is.How do you know I didn't deploy any cash at the last dip ? I did, and now I'm waiting for another to deploy some more, and guess what, when it dips again I'll have more cash ready to go.

Why didn't you deploy cash at the last dip ? Why not ? Because I know that you didn't. You see, I'm a mind reader too

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*Defense will always grow, even during peace time the world's leading powers are in a never ending arms race... Just incase!Biden is a Wilsonian Democrat. He believes in promoting human rights and democracy abroad and firmly agrees with the New World Order as shaped by Roosevelt/Truman at the end of WWII.

So yes, there's no way Biden will be an isolationist in office. He hasn't been for 30 years.I agree.  I like guns.  I keep a shotgun in my closet but I don't consider myself a gun nut. Gun Nuts  Typically do not like Democrat presidents. Do you know who loves Democrat presidents? Firearm and ammunition dealers because every time there is a democratic president they see a spike in sales.  I remember they had to put a limit on how many 22. Cal rounds you could buy during the Obama administration because gun nuts where buying the stores out of ammo.A Biden presidency will bring down the market, regardless of sector. I’m far from a Trump supporter, but his pumping of this market into a massive bubble, combined with Biden’s plans on corporate taxes, antitrust probes, and capital gains taxes will absolutely bring the market back to a more reasonable valuation.Apologies if this could be easily googled, what are good “defense sector” stocks? Im brand new to investing and had no idea the defense sector would even be a part of stocksThe defense budget will likely not take a hit, but the amount of money that is allocated towards projects that go to companies like Raytheon, Lockheed, etc will. The DoD is spending a lot on coronavirus and scraping money up from random projects to support that.

Under Biden, you'll see a shift away from the border wall and towards things like hypersonics, cyber warfare, and information warfare.

Overall, I would bet big on Raytheon since they have solid hypersonics and cyber security programs.Yep said the same thing 3 weeks ago:

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hn9ydm/defense_stocks_what_the_heck_is_going_on/

Completely agreed and I’m loaded on calls on LMT and NOC. I’ve been ringing the bell on defense since early July. These companies should not have seen a drop after corona. Lockheed still grew everything, and until two weeks ago was sitting at 75% of what it was pre corona. Despite having no material impact.

After the election I’ll scoop up shares of RTX and LHX, which I think will perform very well in the face of budget cuts (which I don’t even think will happen).

Don’t forget these defense contractors export as well. Australia is beefing up their defense spending and their military is basically just a proxy for American equipment. Japan pledged to more spending, and SK probably will too.

I think the market is misguided on this one and giving a ‘Biden discount’. And I’ll take that discount and make money on it. The fact that the new Defense bill for next year passed so effortlessly at $740B this week should clue you in on how it will go in the future tooBiden needs help eating his soup.  I doubt he is coherent with defense and geopolitics.A growing contingent of today's Democratic Party is very interested in defunding/abolishing the military.   It's hard to be bullish on defense when you're faced with this reality.Haha, yes!Yep. Some forget Biden was among the first in the senate to push for military intervention in Bosnia and Kosovo. Also pushed for NATO expansion as wellYou overestimate politics. At worse it’s a slight pullback. It’ll get back to where it was and more long termAgreed. But many people like to assume that Biden bringing down the market is bad when in reality it is realistic compared to the current pipe dream they are currently living in with the stimulus.Defense companies are typically government contractors that are allotted money to build aircraft, vehicles, weapons, communication systems, etc. for the US military. For example, Lockheed Martin is famous for their F-22 Raptor, the world's first modern fighter jet, as well as building the chassis for NASA's Hubble. That's just one of many examples though.I would suggest looking into the holdings for the ETFs [XAR](https://www.etf.com/XAR) and [ITA](https://www.etf.com/ITA).  You can use the links I just provided for each, you just need to scroll down to where it shows the top 10 holdings and then click [View All].

Either of those ETFs are good to invest in as well if you just want to capture the industry as a whole.  XAR is equal-weight (each company gets around the same amount of investment exposure from your dollars) and ITA is a market-cap weight (companies with the largest market-cap get more of your dollars invested in them).Completely agree on Raytheon. Lot's of new tech in research and development with them.Lockheed is a solid bet as well. Increased presence in space, more F-35 orders in SEAN, and hypersonics could all benefit Lockheed. And the F-35 program is a cash cow that will last for decades, so there's very little downside.I disagree, future cuts will be to payroll (automation in the Navy, for example look at crew requirements on a Zumwalt vs. an Arleigh-Burke) while a greater portion will be spent on equipment and technology. 

There was some good stuff on Foreign Policy and War on the Rocks a while back, I think it was someone from Anduril. Plus looking at trends in each NDS points us towards moving back to a highly mobile, expeditionary force like the US was before WWI.I read an article recently (maybe in The Atlantic) that talked about how he had a pretty serious stuttering problem and still deals with it.  That probably has a lot to do with why he sounds like a confused old man sometimes. 

He also just might be a confused old man sometimes.Is he senile, perhaps. But, when you spend your whole life doing something you don't just forget how to do it. He has been practicing law and politics his whole life, he definitely understands what he's doing. Just a little confused sometimes.Who is calling to abolish the military?Literally no one is calling to abolish the military.

Have a downvote, liar.Won’t happen. America’s reactionary culture is exemplified when faced with existential threats. In a hypothetical world where Democrats rule and sink our 11 CSGs to make artificial reefs, they’ll be the first ones to commission 11 new CSGs when Russia finds its 7 geographic anchors and starts floating a blue water navy with a sizable expeditionary force. Even more so if the Democrats keep going down the extreme socially progressive path as opposed to Putin’s social conservatism.Most Democratic politicians have very similar views. It's more about gaining party approval to keep rising up in political stature. But, when time comes, many are faced with a rude awakening. 

Second, a more valid response is "s**t happens". For example, Obama was very adamant about lowering defense budgets; however, war broke out in the Middle East, specifically, Afghanistan, and he had no choice but to give the DOD and DHS more funds.Not heard of anyone looking to do any drastic measures to our military. And if their were, they will likely be faced with reality very soon.I’m not denying that most democratic presidents improve the market over their terms, but Biden having to deal with the long term effects of this pandemic, as well as the democratic anti big business, anti trader agenda could have a long lasting effect. We haven’t really seen any real economic effects of the pandemic yet.Lmao, I don't think the commander of the US nuclear arsenal should be " Just a little confused sometimes. "Who he is and what he thinks is irrelevant. Who's interests he represents is what actually matters.

I suspect that we will have a clue based on his VP "pick"He hasn’t been practicing law his whole life!  He’s been a senator his whole life.  Politics.  He would have failed the bar exam at any point in the last 30 yearsWe still spend more than all other nations combined on our military. There's a slight difference between abolishing and defundingWell it looks like we’re SOL either way then.Haha. Our options for Prez are dumb and dumber. Don't blame me.You may not like the current president, but I wouldn’t say he is confused.Lol ummm ok then buckaroo.**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*The 7nm process that intel is seeking to perfect is literally pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved within the realm of physics. The specific issue is with a process called patterning which involves splitting up features into different masks and then lining them up on the final die. Keep in mind that the intel 7nm process works just as TSMC's process works. The difference is that with both the amount of reject dies is very high but TSMC/AMD has elected to deal with higher reject levels. Finally TSMC's 7nm process is much more similar in terms of surface feature sized to intels 10nm process with TSMCs process producing only slightly smaller features some of the time wheras others like transistor gates are identical.

If/when intel gets thier 7nm process where they want it their chips should definitively lead in performance compared to AMD but for right now AMD wins the day.This stuff is super hard, and even small defects torpedo the entire chip sometimes. Yield determines how much profit you make drastically, and even  small differences in yield are important. They have to print many billions of details with perfection to get a chip that works. A handful of errors in that may cause the entire thing to fail.They have just had failure after failure, just bad luck and bad management, intel has been at this road before. Same for AMD, they invented the 64bit processor for x64 (where intel has to pay or had to pay license fees) but failed to execute, they are just back in the game but we’ll have to wait until next week 

Both intel and AMD profits from the server market, AMD more where cloud is huge, intel is lost thereThey announced delays to 7 nm, and the market reacted and its down 17%

Honestly I think they're oversold. They're still a solid company, very well diversified, and I don't think AMD is going to run them out of business. I actually bought a small stake in Intel today.

A current price to earnings ratio of 10, with a solid dividend. I don't think their earnings will be hurt much in the future. I strongly suspect AMD will hit a brick wall soon after Zen 3 much like Intel.Not sure I’ve mentioned a loss but looks like you’re betting on the right horse so that’s all goodBuying opportunity for INTC?>  Can Intel ever recover with Jim Keller out?

What did they do without him before?  I mean other than totally dominate the semiconductor market for decades, invent one of the most successful processor architectures of all time, and make insane amounts of money?  :)

I get the concern about Jim Keller, but at the same time the idea of the "lone genius" is WAY over hyped by the media.  It's even worse at large companies, and Intel has 100K employees.  I doubt there were more than 100 who worked with him, and likely a small circle of 20 who talked to him on a daily basis.  He undoubted had an impact at AMD, but they're 1/10th Intel's size.

What matters far more at large companies are people who are team players, who pull their weight, and are easy to get along with.  Those sorts of people have a different reputation, but it's not that of being lone geniuses.

Seriously, can you name any of the chip designers before or after Jim?  I can't, and I've been following the industry from when 286 was a thing.  Yet Intel has been very successful all these decades.Are you talking about quad patterning? That's Intel 10nm, not 7nm. 10nm was pushing the boundaries of DUV. I don't think anyone outside Intel actually knows what their 7nm problem is (probably other than Charlie and cohorts, unless he finished his articles). But do correct me if I'm wrong.It’s hard to stress how tiny 7 nm is. Many individual protein molecules are larger in size than 7 nm (70 Å). Double stranded DNA 20 bases long is about 7 nm.Even when Intel get their 7nm process working, they'll probably still be behind AMD/TSMC.  TSMC has been making a lot of progress on their 5nm process. I believe they plan to start mass production soon. So even if Intel has no more delays getting 7nm working, they'll still be a year or two behind TSMC. And considering that Intel still has issues with their 10nm process, that seems like a pretty big if. I know that the 10nm and 7nm have different teams working on them, and that problems on one don't mean there will be problems on the other, but considering this is already the second time 7nm has been delayed, I'm not very confident that Intel will get their 7nm process working with no more delays.> difference is that with both the amount of reject dies is very high but TSMC/AMD has elected to deal with higher reject levels

I think it should be noted that AMD is *able* to deal with higher reject levels due to Infinity Fabric. Intel's mesh isn't currently comparable. AMD can stitch together 4 good 1/4 size dies to make a single good chip. Intel needs the entire die to be reject free to use it. This means a single error would leave that die unusable, while AMD could still use 75% of it. I'm definitely a little out of date, but 1-2 years ago I think the yields/die sizes worked out with Intel needing to pay 2.5x in silicon to create an equivalent chip. 

I agree on the Intel 7nm > AMD 7nm, but TSMC has reported high yields for their 5nm and 3nm development is well underway. Please correct me if any of this is wrong.Didn't Intel server group see a 34% rise in profit as per this last earnings call?

I don't see how that's a loss...Actually as of last quarter AMD had <5% market share in server/ cloud and Intel had >95% market share. Intel still doing good keeping market share although they are having all these fab issues.Really weird that investors fixate on his departure but no concern was expressed when almost all of the top execs at apple have left, including Jonny Ives.AFAIK multi-patterning is required for everything below 10nm until EUV is mature and even then it may still be used for some features (TSMC uses SAQP for fins)All the individual transistor feature sizes are bigger than 7nm too... they're marketing numbers put too much stock in them. "7nm" does describe a denser process than Intel's 14 but neither of them are really accurate to feature sizes.Their current performance is good, their expected future performance is going to be worseAMD and ARM CPUs are making serious inroads into the server space, where Intel was typically the main player. Demand for servers doesn't change all that much, so when people start to see the price/performance of AMD, and the power savings you get with ARM, it doesn't leave a whole lot of room for Intel.Just because AMD is cheaper per core does not mean it's the better deal. What people don't realize is that most enterprise software charges based on the number of cores on the machine, and those software licenses are generally several times more expensive than the processor in the server. So even though you get way more cores per dollar with AMD, Intel has better performance per core, making it better value.

There's also the issue of reliability. If your applications have always ran on Intel CPUs, do you want to risk rebuilding on a new server that runs AMD where the drivers and chipset is completely different? The odds of a problem are unlikely, but do you want to risk it to save a couple grand?Demand for servers has increased as a whole, that's why Intel has been doing so good recently despite losing market share. But yes, long term you can't count on that continuing**Hi, welcome to /r/investing. Please note that as a topic focused subreddit we have higher posting standards than much of Reddit:**

If AWS revenue has slowed, and even if ecommerce jumped 60% as MasterCard reported last week (IIRC), Amazon’s expenses to hire and implement COVID testing, along with regulatory scrutiny, put a bit of a grey cloud over near-term outlook.

I’m long AMZN but I’m going to buy some protective puts if AMZN has the typical pre earnings bump the next couple of trading days.Wouldn't stronger usage in cloud computing translate into higher sales growth? Could someone shed some light on why there was a discrepancy?I actually think the MSFT trade may be nearing its final stages. I say this as someone who bought MSFT at $44. Azure growth under 50% and declining, margin expansion has plateaued, growth likely to gradually decline. 

Don’t get me wrong, fantastic company with amazing CEO. But with a forward P/E above 30 and growth probably heading toward high single digits in next few years, hard to see the massive outperformance continuing barring some unforeseen new product success.What I took from the quote is that cloud compute sales are slowing.  The AWS quote is that retail sales will grow.My prediction for internet growth back in March: 

>If people don't have money, they don't buy shit, expansions (digital or real estate) don't get made, upkeep remains stagnant, profits tank.

Usage is up because people are using free streaming services more, that doesn't mean they're paying more for services, if anything, expect an absolute huge cancellation report for Prime (and Netflix and D+ and HBO Max, I'm not playing favorites here) in Q3.

The 600 doll a week just ran out, the next payment will not be made and there is basically no chance when the next check comes it'll be anything like the 600 + monthly state that people are used to. 

While Americans have so far pinched pennies, it's been socking money away in accounts, paying off high interest debt, so on. So it's clear that Americans ARE behaving as though it's a recession.

Now the income is going to decrease, rapidly, even if a new magical 600 a week bill manages to sail the resolute. 

**TL;DR**

pennies are about to be pinched, which means people using free servers streaming more, premium less, which causes all kinds of havoc in "always expand" models.  

Expect pain and cuts now that weekly federal money and employee/employment protection programs diminish and run out.I do think growth will eventually slow, but your P/E numbers are wrong imo. I could see them go to the 40's even if interest rates on bonds and cash remain basically 0 nominally and negative in real terms. Granted, there are limits to that phenomena that has mostly run it's course and there would be volatility with lower expected returns too in the end. I think the next decade will not have the same equity returns as the last one anyways.According to both Yahoo Finance and Morningstar, the forward P/E is above 30. Where are you seeing something different?

Also, to clarify I was trying to emphasize massive outperformance. I don’t think MSFT will underperform - simply rise in-line with or slightly above the broader indexes. 

The stock is up 400% since 2015. A lot of the growth and margin expansion associated with Azure is baked in. To sustain earnings multiples above 30 with that market cap, they have to keep up this type of growth which is just hard for me to envision.I was speaking hypothetically. A lot of value investors think p/e ratios are extreme, but I think it just reflects pricing relative to interest rates. That's all. I think I misread your growth heading to single digits as saying the multiple would head in that direction. My bad.No problem, sir. I’m not a value investor anyway haha. My largest position is Cloudflare. And like I said, I was on the Microsoft train a long time ago. What Nadella has done is amazing and unlike any turnaround I’ve ever seen of a mega cap company. Hope I’m wrong. That $1.5tn market cap scares me a weeee bit though, as does the role of passive investing/ETFs pushing mega cap tech so much higher (Apple, Amazon, you too).**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

I think much of the disconnect in understanding the Fed comes from people here not really knowing how the implicit promises impact liquidity.  

Much of the illiquidity you see during times of financial stress comes from institutions offloading longer term holdings in favor of liquid short terms holdings out of fear.  The thought process is very similar to a run on banks in that if you're holding mid term corporate debt that you intended to liquidate in a year or two you think "wow, the corporate market is really running in to issues, I'll sell now".  This creates a cascading effect where liquidity just continues to dry up and spreads continue to widen - the Fed simply stepping in and promising to open a corporate facility alleviates this.  They may never need to purchase a single bond but the promise is there.  So now your institution that planned on liquidating in six months or a year doesn't run for safety today because the Fed has effectively promised to backstop credit availability should they need to - in this sense the promise is more important than them actually injecting anything in to markets.

In simplistic terms rolling out the corporate credit facilities was effectively just "I'll catch you if you fall" to allow the market to continue operating without fear of credit crunches down the line.An actual high quality post that challenges my view. Thanks

Reminds me of the old saying that market is perception.Cool.

As a gold stocks investor this tickles my interest.I still talk to a few friends in SLF every couple of weeks and I agree the Fed had to do something from what they share with me... but it feels as though the continued effort to grease the cogs is just creating downstream issues.  Great editorial today in the FT by Dizard about the effects of the Fed's backstops and associated risks.  El-Erian has also made some good points on how trapped central banks are now.  On a smaller scale, I hear average Joes talking about how the Fed will always "save" the market and how risk has been effectively eliminated.  At some point "financial stress" needs to be one of the rules of the game, not an extrinsic force to be wiped out via central bank intervention.I agree. I learned that this year. 

The Fed's statements hold almost as much power as it's actions.[removed]They still need to set up these facilities even if they have a low total number of transactions and holdings though in order to maintain the credibility of those statements.  That's pretty much why they were rolled out despite the need for them having largely disappeared by the time they actually went into effect.  If the Fed was constantly flexing and never following through statements and promises wouldn't carry the same the same weight they do ultimately.Your submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

Advertising dried up big and many Companies are still looking to cut spend in 2H.I think FB will stand out from the rest of digital marketers when they release earnings.   
If you go on instagram, its full of ads from small companies and personal businesses (artists, influencers, etc.). FB's ad platform is unlike the other companies you mentioned. It's extremely easy and effective to do an ad campaign through their services. 

In addition, I daily active users on Facebook platforms has likely shot up during COVID. I wouldn't be surprised if they post increase in Ad revenue. Given how Mark didn't seem phased boycott, he's probably feeling pretty fine with how FB ads are doing.Verizon is # 4 for digital marketing? What? Where do I learn more?Just a thought, there's an election soon. I'd guess record earnings.This was my DD as well (**Twitter** ad revenue was also down), but I'm wondering how to reconcile with the one standout, which is **Snap**, which reported an increase in ad revenue.I had to use Google to double check and see that Bing is still around. 

Ironically, I'm still long on MSFT.Sorry about your puts bud.ads got cheaper to place. less competition for the ad slot. seeing ads doesn't mean anything, the cost of the ad may have halved.Aren’t small businesses hurt the most from COVID-19?Ad revenues will be WAY down for FacebookI honestly do not understand anyone who will  go long on FB..probably its yahoo/aol divisionsVerizon is #5. Microsoft is #4

https://www.emarketer.com/content/us-digital-ad-spending-will-surpass-traditional-in-2019Verizon Media is the subsidiaryMsft can't be good at everything??  
Market went down heavily the last 2 days.   


I would only be very wary if that continues until the earnings. In that case there could be a rally on bad news.   
But if the market goes up the next 3 days a lot, earnings could be used for a big sell off.  


  
Also I don't have put (yet)  
Will decide in the next 3 days if I buy into some short term OTM putsTrue, we’ll have to wait for earning to see what happens!True- but some are doing well. Based on my feed lots of people are taking this time to invest and promote their side business, I’m seeing lots of artists advertising their works or Kickstarter like products. Also, political season means tons of political ads.Just to show how dominant Facebook and google are in advertising.Earnings reports are next week, so better make up your mind soon or decide to do it after earnings.**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

To say that newer companies have employees from older companies is kind of like...yeah, that's going to happen. I assume that Tesla is claiming that Rivian is directly offering it's people some perk in order to get them to move companies.Nobody read the articleYet Tesla builds a plant in China where clearly all their secrets will be stolen... it must be great to have another country do all your research and development and then you just get to make/copy the end result.That’s a clean- looking truckTwo of the four named employees are HR/recruiters. One is environmental health and safety manager, and one is a product manager on supercharger network. They appear to be targeting people who might know who the good employees are to recruit from Tesla, not engineers with some top secret technology. I know it sucks to have good people leave for another company, but Tesla benefited from good people leaving other companies to join them. It's a two way street. I would avoid joining Tesla as an engineer, you don't want to deal with these bitter litigious companies if you ever decide to leave.You can "poach" employees in California, it's a no non-compete state.

Also, 4 out of 178 former Tesla employees who went to Rivian supposedly "stealing" documents is not a "pattern." Seems like Tesla wants to intimidate Rivian and its former employees. All the more reason to avoid Tesla as an employer, if you didn't have enough already.I've never heard of Rivian, when's the IPO I'm all in if Tesla is mad at them.The thief was caught emailing confidential documents to her own gmail account.

“On July 7, 2020, after her conversation With Duran and the same day that Wong received an update on her background check by Rivian, she sent at least sixteen highly confidential and trade secret recruiting documents from Tesla’s network to her Gmail account, including various guides and templates developed by Tesla—the very types of documents that Duran had instructed her that Rivian needed.”

https://electrek.co/2020/07/23/tesla-sues-rivian-stealing-trade-secrets/So was Tesla serious about open sourcing their patents or not?Only some of their stuff is open source, taking the rest is called stealingIt’s weird that a couple of years ago Tesla was giving away their patents and bragging about poaching employees from Apple...now this.Wasn't Elon big on sharing technology to advance the world or something?Hmmm, wonder what Tesla bulls think about them being this worried about Rivian.Tesla treats their employees like trash and then throws a fit over other company "poaching" them.  Uh huh...Here comes the unhinged Elon. I've been waiting.So much for Musks altruistic desire to spread electric even if it was to the detriment of Tesla.Rivian is outta my price range, but their SUV is *beautiful.*

Nice of Tesla to give them some press.Interesting, but I dont think anything will come of  it. Side note, whatever happened to all the tesla fanboys praising elon for making all his EV tech open source? I mean, one would assume this is what Elon wanted.I hadn't heard of Rivian up until this point. I like the way they look though.Lmao you can sue for poaching employees? Hahahaha oh my god, then take care of them to where they dont want to leave. What a pussified reasoning to sue.[removed]Maybe those employees just fell in love with Normal, IllinoisRivian partnered with Ford. I don’t think they merged though even I think Ford considered it at one timeLol. Tesla wants to monopolize everything. Gets mad when competition starts popping up. Personally I think the Rivian looks much better than the Cybertruck. If I was in the market for an electric vehicle I'd go for the Rivian. 

Also will definitely be hopping onto any Rivian IPO. Especially after seeing Tesla's stock price.Tesla is a sell with both hands as it is the #1 bubble stock on nasdaq with amazonI didn't know rivian and ford were making the same Bronco...HOW THE TURN TABLESIm new to [investing](https://bsadvice.com/) should I buy TSLAGotta find someway to make a profit when those credits run outThis is a large company using its resources to crush a small company because they pose a threat. In addition, it is laughable for a private company to claim intellectual property. The technology that Tesla uses was funded with public money from across the world within tex payer funded institutions. That is why technologies like these should be nationalised.who cares electric vehicles need to happen to save the earth.Poaching employees is as old as time.non-compete clauses are an abomination to market economics and should be banned.

Guess which candidate for president thinks we should [do something about it?](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1209263668736745473)I’m a bit confused about stealing secrets.

Didn’t they make a lot of their IP public? Including some battery tech to encourage future development? (Or am I mis-remembering?)Just started reading about Nikola...What does Tesla vs. Rivian vs. Nikola look like?

Trevor Milton seems like a scam artistI wonder if they’ll survive after they get sued lol this is how a lot of startups just disappear.TSLA bulls so insufferably smug today was fun to watchWhat next AMZN suing bakery for stealing warehouse workers?

Somebody need to slap the big names. Rivian is the only promising competitor make silent but tremendous progress. 
I'm sure Tesla doesn't want a competition. They went with NKLA first and now Rivian?>I assume that Tesla is claiming that Rivian is directly offering it's people some perk in order to get them to move companies.

Is that not allowed?This CNBC piece is light in detail, but that is not what is going on here. Tesla is specifically alleging that these employees brought over proprietary Tesla documents and were induced to do so by Rivian.Unless Tesla had them sign a non-compete I don’t see how a court wouldn’t tell Tesla to go pound sand. The engineering expertise of an employee isn’t a company’s intellectual property.That also happens all the time.  When I've worked for small aerospace companies with startup vibes the same kind of poaching was just business as usual.  Point being that you should never expect your trade secrets to stay secret for long.  They will walk to the next company in the minds of some of your top talent and there is not much you can do to stop it.  This is also why having a good moat around your business is vital.  You need to make it financially harder for new competitors to enter into your business space and take market share.  You can do this by building trust in your brand name and aggressively marketing for new business or with new products.  You can keep innovating new tech to keep ahead of the game.  Patents are great to keep people out of your space for some time.According to the person I know who worked for Tesla, that wouldn’t be hard to do. Apparently they treat their employees like shit.I’d be surprised if space x doesn’t actively do thisRivian is has perception issues in the industry for poaching people and stealing ideasIt has just becomes another daily Tesla discussion post without regards to the article contentNIO probably already built a cloned plant across town lmaoNew TeslaIsn't a lot of Tesla's IP tied to its software and data though? I mean anybody can just buy a car and disassemble it.
    
Kind of like how Apple makes all their iPhones in China but it's not like China suddenly got any more trade secrets that they couldn't have acquired before manufacturing moved there.Honestly still can't believe they built that plant. Like, did no one from the State Dept warn them!?Rivian’s mistake was not paying China for the stolen Tesla tech.> it must be great to have another country do all your research and development and then you just get to make/copy the end result.

Worked out just great for the United States. 
https://www.history.com/news/industrial-revolution-spies-europeCongrats you just discovered how literally every developed country gets to where they are now.It's the same playbook as Apple. In 10 years, Chinese car manufacturer will be the next Huawei for smartphone and we have Elon Musk to blame.

But he'll be rich and making his next startup facade.[This article](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4339781-teslas-transformation-chinese-company-seems-unstoppable) I read a while back (behind SA premium now, unfortunately) outlines the idea pretty well. Tesla's business in China is solely to the benefit and at the approval of CCP.When someone else steals your company secrets and you get no value, that's the issue. Tesla makes more when China steals than when Rivian does. Tesla gets access to cheap materials/labor from China.They don't care about the employees themselves, all they care about it's the documents they took with them. It's a competitive market and to hire the best candidates you have to spend a lot of time developing the right methods and tools and now Rivian can have it all with little effort. That's not fair at all.You're gonna get downvoted by the tesla fuck boysI think Ford owns a good chunkAmazon ordered 100,000 vehicles from them.I'm aware of a company that sells go them.  They are building huge, like 5 millions SQ foot plants.  Walmart, Amazon, and Goes have all invested.  Electric trucks that are insanely cool.  Definitely worth a Google.Absolutely beautiful off-road electric trucks. Fully functional with so many features for outside things. Can't wait for them to come outDon't give actual details that provide context. The people have read the headline and made up their minds! /sEven me, as a worker in a public institution, everything I create belongs to the institution. I'm not allowed to use it for anything else.
  
For Tesla,  it's a huge loss of competitivity if it becomes a trend. I understand their point of you. You can leave for another company, just leave what belongs to Tesla at Tesla.Not sure, but it’s worth noting that trade secrets are not the same thingI believe Tesla open sourced outdated patents that they no longer usedNope. That’s just padding for Elon’s PR campaign as ‘nice guy who only cares about helping the world’IrrelevantMostly a PR move, wasn’t anything of actual valueClearly it's a PR front. A genius one, at that, and gained him many fanboys.My thoughts exactly! Threatened much?Lol why is this downvoted. Musk is loved by lefties but then actively crushes unions in his own company. Not a great work place by any metric.I agree there. This is going to spread the word about rivian more than anything else. Everything with Tesla hits front page2 employees uploaded internal pdf’s to their gmail after after recruitment. And also one of them refused to turn their laptop back into Tesla after being hired by Rivian.Your submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

Companies work actively to beat competition. And it is public companies who own almost all the intellectual property there is. How old are you?Rivian isn't exactly a brand new start up. They have several billion dollars, offices in multiple states and have been around 10 years. They will be making deliveries in 2021, it's pretty far along in the processI agree, but you can’t let employees walk out the door with your source code either, that’s theft.I understand the reporting on that to have been a little exaggerated, the announcement was much more geared on the PR side. It was more about sharing communications protocols and kernels (things that help them anyway with wider adoption) rather than any patents that help differentiate their products.They offered bi-directional patent indemnification.  You can’t sue tesla and also use their “free” patent.Nikola is still appearing to be a scam, but Rivian is very real. Close ties with ford and a huge order from amazon. They are the real deal and Tesla is now obviously taking them seriously.Rivian isn't going anywhere because of a Tesla lawsuit. They are backed by ford, Amazon, and investments from Standard chartered and T Rowe. I think they have a couple billion in capital and will be delivering vehicles early 2021What a terrible day. Went from 550% gains to only 500% lmaoIronically Amazon is a backer of RivianIt's allowed, but when it's lawsuit material it's usually because company a believes company b is trying to get it's employees in an effort to possibly damage company a and/or liberate it's secrets and know-how.It's not allowed to hire an employee to try and recreate trade secrets from another company. Depending on what's going on there could be something wrong here.Non-disclosure, non-compete agreements are very common.  I am not a lawyer, but I don't think it's legal for one company to offer to help employees of another company break their employment contract. I think it's tortious inference. And if they're stealing trade secrets that's a violation of the economic espionage act.Not a lawyer but i  would imagine Tesla is claiming that the former employees are bringing Tesla's secrets over to themDepends on the role, if NDA was signed, but in general yes it happens... however most tech companies make new hires sign IP and patent agreements (i work in HR for a software company)I wonder if Rivian allow unions, unlike Tesla.

Maybe Tesla needs to do like Ford in the old days and pay employees really well.Hey smart guy. Learn that thing we need to know and then quit for more money and do it here.Too lazy to source but Tesla for sure has
Poached tooAsk Elon. He was the one doing the poaching last round... 
https://www.thedailybeast.com/spacex-stole-our-best-minds-chip-maker-sues-elon-musk-startupDepends if company A had a non-compete agreement. While they’re usually way overused, I can see the value of a non-compete in engineering/tech fields where the RandD investment is huge for new creations, and new creations usually require building up that persons skill and knowledge. Rivian is basically taking Tesla’s investment into the person (asset) and converting the asset into their own profit. 

If there are specialized skills and knowledge that are valuable to Tesla, They should be able to stop the employee from taking that knowledge and giving it to Rivian.Tesla would seem to be justified in filing suit with that information.Yes, but the trade secret theft claim is still valid even in California, assuming they have the evidence to prove it.If they are california employees, then the non compete is very useful when toilet paper runs outNon-compete is one thing, and as noted before hard to enforce especially in some locations, but an NDA is another matter.Considering, I'm guessing there was some sort of non-compete signed.Pay politicians to pass expensive and expansive regulations to which startup or small business can comply. Bonus points if they are esoteric and weird enough that no foreign government has similar regulations in place to stifle competition from international companies.I've known some people, indirectly, that have worked for them as well. I've heard similar stories.

It's simply not viable to be competitive in the market there without building the cars locally. It costs a ton of money (and time) to ship a fully assembled car across the sea.

AND the Chinese government is heavily pushing people towards EVs. You have to win a lottery if you want to buy an ICE car there, whereas you get to skip the lottery if you buy an EV.where else can you find literal slave labor?>~~Tesla's~~ business in China is solely to the benefit and at the approval of CCP.What documents do you think an HR person took with them?
To hire the best candidates, you have to spend a lot of time not building a reputation as a sweatshop that might go after you if you ever decide to leave.For the record, I upvoted him, but I don’t like non-competes, they’re abused by an increasing number companies as a way to hold back raises or retain employees in toxic environments. In this case though... if the employees mentioned were in research positions, this is the kind of stuff that non-compete contracts have a legitimate case for. There is a legitimate purpose here because billions of dollars have been invested to create the technology. 

Software patents are a controversial minefield because sometimes there’s only one way to do something right and the terms of many patents are absurdly broad or vague. 

A software developer at Tesla can always just go work for another company that doesn’t make cars. A software developer at Google or Amazon may have more trouble finding another company that doesn’t compete with Google or Amazon in some way. 

The decision of some states to determine that non-competes are automatically enforceable or unenforceable is pretty absurd and over applied. The situation needs redefined in a way that prevents employees from being liable, protects companies from losses of legitimate cost and effort, and protects employees from becoming trapped working at one company because the terms of competition are too broad.and AMZNYou try to make one funny...


https://www.tesla.com/en_CA/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-youTrade secrets also have no protection, so no point in suing. Sounds like Tesla is just desperateIirc the patents were for things like charging adapter designs. Opening them up was an attempt to make the design an industry standard. It means we could build up a consistent recharge station infrastructure across the country instead of building tesla recharge stations, Rivien stations, Ford stations, etc.Similar working conditions at Space X. I know a guy who used to work there. He went from quirky and delightful to cynical and anxious (to the point of needing therapy) in less than a year and a half.Musk isn’t loved by “lefties” at all, lol. Maybe on paper to people who aren’t involved in politics at more than a surface level.People just read the headline and just imagine how it went down without reading a sungle detail.Calm down. Read again.Wow I didn’t know that’s crazyyyy. I shall dig deeper in to this company, thank you for the information!Perhaps company a should pay more then if those employees are so valuable.What’s wrong is the disclosure. No problem with hiring the employees, but the moment they talk about IP that violates their NDA, both the employee and company are liable.Why? If they bought the talent, why are they not allowed to exploit it?Non-disclosure and non-competes are generally unenforceable unless the employer compensates the signee (the employee) by paying them at minimum as much as they made while still employed for however many years the agreement covers. 

If an employee stops getting paid by their former employer they are generally allowed to share anything the learned during that employment.Aren't non-compete agreements almost completely unenforceable?We have this even at Jimmy Johns. Can’t leave and go to a different franchise one or a competitor for a few months.They do pay really well. And they design and manufacture in the US. It’s awesome>Hey smart guy. Learn that thing we need to know and then quit for more money and do it here.

 Is..is *that* not allowed?They have poached a ton of talent from software companies like google in the past.  Its SV, thats what they do.Right, people are focusing on the poaching part. What’s really an issue is targeting their employees that know how a piece of technology works and then having them Seville proprietary information to them.

How would they prove this? Have an employee you trust apply at the company and gather evidence as a double agent. It’s been done before.Heard the same from people who worked for Space X.  Musk tends to take advantage of young ambitious fanboy/fangirl employees, overworking them for relatively low payIt's making a profit today in exchange for selling away the future. Wouldn't be surprised if Tesla cars were flat out banned in China in 10 years.If you are a billionaire investor, the communist government is not likely to oppress you.Market size for Tesla goes to 0 when the CCP bans foreign auto makers. Just give it some time, ~10 years.Also trueThe lawsuit says documents related to recruiting templates, structures, formulas, candidates lists and skills, existing staff salary structures, files on executive level candidates. That's definitely important information for a company that hires thousands of people to stay competitive in the job market. 

Do you think people who join Tesla don't know it's not a sweat shop and pays lower than say a similar FAANG job? i know PhD students in my lab who interned at Tesla and work full time there now. All of them are the smartest folks I've ever met and they of course had offers from Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple. They know they were going to be getting paid a lot less and they'll have to work their ass off but all of them joined Tesla. I guess the reputation of being a place where you have a lot of emphasis on R&D and freedom to experiment and work on a real world product with some of the brightest minds around is definitely an incentive for many people.Very well thought out and written.and TROWUm... Trade secrets most certainly do have protection.Trade secrets are a type of intellectual property and so are subject to IP infringement laws.[18 USC 1836](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defend_Trade_Secrets_Act)

Literally every state also has its own trade secret protections. You are very VERY misinformedBeautiful trucks and SUVs, watch some videos. They are amazing productsThat often doesn't work in practice.

Suppose you have the highest pay in the industry.  You spend $1B researching 500 different formulas for batteries.  Any of them is simple enough that anybody could memorize them.  It turns out that 499 of them are duds, but 1 of them is a significant improvement.

Here is the problem - that formula is something that dozens of employees at least end up knowing.  It cost the company $1B to obtain that formula - not so much to obtain the formula but to figure out that this is the one worth putting in the product.

Now some other company can just offer one of those dozen employees $1M as a signing bonus and they get a $1B secret.  So, pay them all $10M a year!  Well, now the company can offer $100M and STILL get a $1B secret.  

And it wasn't like any of those dozen employees "discovered" that formula due to their ingenuity and deserve all the money personally.  Maybe those 500 formulas are just all random tweaks of a common formula, and it was purely trial and error that lead to the right formula.  ANYBODY who did the work would have discovered it - the company just had to assign the testing to 100 scientists testing 5 formulas each at great expense, and one got lucky, purely because they were lucky.

While I agree that companies should pay employees well to retain them, that doesn't mean that this is a substitute for IP law.  If you make the cheapest approach to R&D to let somebody else do the work and then just poach their employees for a bit more, then nobody will do R&D, and all of those employees will end up unemployed.

Don't get me wrong - I think that plenty of employees are underpaid or not given sufficient bonuses for their creative discoveries.  However, the person who pulls the ball out of the lottery machine shouldn't get a cut of the jackpot every time somebody wins just for being the person who drew the ball.As an engineer who doesn’t work in that industry but works for a consulting company that has projects for Tesla’s battery factory, they do pay them a lot. But it’s possible that rivian either pays them the same or less for a lower expected work output. Like yeah it’s nice getting paid 50-75k more than other engineering jobs, but it’s also nice not being expected to have the same work mentality as your ceo.Pay is not everything it's the biggest factor but other things play a factor. If you are getting a few thousand more it's not gonna be life changing to make you always want to leave. People and culture make you stayU daft?

B pays more than A.
If A pays more, then B pays more.
B pays more than A.
If A pays more, then B pays more.

But ya, A just needs to find the magical number that will prevent B from paying more to extract trade secrets likely worth millions or even billions. 😑It's not just about NDAs or non-competes or any of that. If an employee has access to trade secrets and then he joins a different company and helps them recreate those trade secrets that violates IP law.

Trade secrets are very specific things, it's not just anything the employee worked on.

 [https://ogletree.com/insights/departing-employees-ensuring-protection-of-trade-secrets-and-intellectual-property/](https://ogletree.com/insights/departing-employees-ensuring-protection-of-trade-secrets-and-intellectual-property/) 

Relevant quote from an international perspective: " Typically, the only protection that survives is a requirement to preserve secrecy in relation to “confidential information.” However, even then, it is often only the most sensitive trade secrets that are protected. Disputes can arise over what constitutes a trade secret of the sort an employer can own (as unique to the employer) versus mere general “know-how” which the employee picks up through doing the work. "

So, even in the absence of any agreement, many countries protect specific types of confidential information which often includes trade secrets.Usually you sign a lot of documents (non-disclosures + non-competes)regarding who owns different kinds of software/hardware/manufacturing applications/designs. As an engineer myself you have to agree that you won't work in X for X years/months after leaving a position or you open yourself up to a lawsuit.Because what you work on at X company while employed and were paid for belongs to X company.I don’t know the specific laws, it’s just not allowed. I’ve received training on it at large corporations and they advise R&D teams to carefully avoid even the appearance of impropriety when employees may have trade secret knowledge that they’ve brought over from other companies. Trade secrets are also specific things, it’s not just a catch all for everything. Companies have to take specific actions to identify and protect what they consider to be trade secrets.

You can read more here: https://www.dlapiperaccelerate.com/knowledge/2017/best-practices-in-hiring-to-protect-trade-secrets.html> Non-disclosure and non-competes are generally unenforceable unless the employer compensates the signee (the employee) by paying them at minimum as much as they made while still employed for however many years the agreement covers.

That is true for non-compete agreements, but generally not for non-disclosure.  

The reason for this is that a non-compete agreement basically denies an employee the ability to work in their chosen field AT ALL except for one employer (who obviously then wields inappropriate power in setting their salary).

However, a nondisclosure agreement doesn't interfere with anybody working in any job.  They just can't talk about the work they did for the other company, or directly replicate it (in the sense of discovery - if you were paid to type up letters you can obviously type up letters at the new company, but you can't tell your new boss that your old boss is working on a new product line which you learned from typing up one of his letters).

Just about every company requires NDAs and they're really not a big deal.  They still get skirted to a degree - you can't talk about exactly what your employer did before but often people end up taking advantage of processes they learned about.  However, if a battery chemist at Tesla ended up introducing the same chemistry at Ford, they could get in a lot of trouble.

Also, you're allowed to use the benefit of experience.  If you do some job for 10 years at one company, chances are you're a lot better at it after 10 years, and you don't have to pretend that you're fresh out of college at the new job.  You just can't actually borrow your previous work products at the new company (like copying source code as a programmer).

Really though the laws for NDAs are pretty reasonable and practical.  It is non-compete agreements that tend to get a lot of abuse.  I wouldn't lump them together.

Now, in practice it is very hard to enforce an NDA because it can be hard to tell that it was breached.  In contrast a non-compete is easy to enforce assuming it is legal, because simply getting the job is a breach.I don’t know where you live, but In the US this isn’t the law at all. And I don’t see how it would be the law anywhere. Pay an employee his full salary for doing no work for years on end so he can’t work for an employer? Name one situation where this is the caseThey're unenforceable in the sense that an employer cannot prevent a former employee from being gainfully employed in the future.  In this case, if your expertise is electric vehicles, then the non compete probably can't prevent you from working for another electric vehicle manufacturer.  However, it can prevent you from creating copycat technology or otherwise directly damage your previous employer.

The burden to prove that the noncomplete prevents them from making a living is generally on the former employee, and its expensive to fight in court, so people tend to abide by them.They are very enforceable in places where several companies work in the same industry and are engineering heavyNot sure why people think this, they are very enforceable if they aren’t overly broad in geographic area, scope, and timeNo one will ever call you out for switching fast food jobs like this, it's just a useless flex companies use to reduce employee turnover.Not when the thing you’re learning is a trade secretIt is if you're China.

I'm only half kidding. People like to point the finger and at China and pretend US companies aren't just as cut-throat when it comes to IP, technology, "trade secrets", etc. Truth is, if you ain't cheatin, you aint tryin.I do know someone directly that went to work for SpaceX. While I don't keep in contact with him (former co-worker,) he seemed pretty happy as a systems programmer.They do the same thing with their customers...With CW2, I wouldn't be surprised if they were banned tomorrow.Except for the whole "Intellectual property theft", the arbitrary detention, the censorship thing, etc.It's all fun and games until Tesla burns them out and then kneecaps their careers on the way out if they decide to go to a competitor.No, you should review the law. There is 0 trade secret protection. Tesla may have a contract with a specific employee to not divulge secrets. They can go after that employee if they do, but Tesla has no legal ground to go after any one that learned of said secret. For that Tesla needs a patent.Fucking thank you. Man, it gets my goat anytime someone tries to oversimplify something and deem it the most logic answer. "pay your staff more and it's not a problem" yeah... Ok.... Sure. Which multi-billion dollar company do you run with words so wise? You're explanation was perfect. Right on.I never thought about this, but thank you for writing this. I never understood how poaching employees would work if they are legally not allowed to trade secrets, but in this case the secret may not even be a secret. Thanks!This is why Bush’s baked beans kept it a family secretthanks for taking the timeIf only we had some way to legally protect new tech innovations, so you could get exclusive rights to the improvement for a number of years.

I'm going to write my Congress person.It’s hard drawing the line as well.  Who is to say that rather than 500 formulas it shouldn’t have been 5000 or 50000 formulas to try simply because Tesla itself hired a person or people from some other random company.  This situation would make Tesla the lawsuit target instead.  Fun fun!Yes, that's the way bidding wars typically work. The bidding will go up to the true value of the employee. It's the same thing that happens with any scare commodity.

Employees are at will these days in nearly every state. If company A needs that employee that badly, perhaps they should pay enough that the employee won't leave.Are you daft?And those clauses are unenforceable. The liability lies with the company, not the employee.While you're right of course that NDAs and Non-competes shouldnt be lumped together NDAs still require due-consideration (in effect, a compensation for being signed) and while simply employment is enough to sign one at the outset, new consideration is needed for every thereafter signed NDA. 

My point which I took as given, which I shouldnt have, is that any NDA signed at the beginning of an employment wouldnt not just have to be well crafted but literally incredibly lucky in what it pertains in order to specifically cover the work being done even just a year from inception in such a frontier invention work such as the work done at Tesla. As broad NDAs (ex: you cant ever share anything you see or hear or learn while working here) effectively arent enforceable new more specific NDAs have to be crafted and signed at every significant enough breakthrough and new consideration (and thereby, compensation) is needed for every one. 

So while NDAs dont require continous compensation such as non-competes I still find it unlikely that an engineer that is experienced enough to be poached (must have worked for several years at tesla) will have been sufficiently covered by specifically constructed NDAs needed to completely inhibit them to share information from their former job. 

Any decent employer would simply have its legal team look over the NDAs of the new employee and conclude what isnt sufficiently covered by NDA specificity and thereby could be shared. 

That is unless the employee was an idiot and shared something that only has to be specified once and will be unchanged enough to forever be covered, like a client list.In california this is most definitely the case. Where both Rivian and Tesla are active.>And I don’t see how it would be the law anywhere. Pay an employee his full salary for doing no work for years on end so he can’t work for an employer?

Sometimes it's not a full salary but something like 75%. And quite a few countries have this, yes. Mine included: Portugal. 

If the company doesn't want to pay, the employee can go work for whoever they want.

The alternative is that someone is out of a job for years because they missed some clause in their contract.Lmao I know I just do the delivery job for extra money since being a high school math teacher can only pay for so much"Trade secrets" should not be legally protected in a free market.This just seems like the world of cut throat corporatism. Which I could not care less about. So if some guy gets poached by someone offering a better deal...I mean, take it.You normally gotta pay double for that kind of action.Again, I don't really agree with that. Every prior case I know where Tesla accused engineers of stealing tech while leaving to a different company was found out to be true. I can cite the examples of Zoox vs Tesla where Tesla filed a law suit against some employees who stole proprietary schematics and they were clearly proven to be true and Zoox agreed and settled. Then there's also the Tesla vs Xpeng case where Tesla claimed that an employee stole auto pilot code while leaving to Xpeng. Although this law suit is still in discovery phase, the employee accepted before court that he uploaded parts of autopilot codebase to his personal iCloud account.You can go after the new employer where they are actively encouraging the theft of trade secrets, which is what Tesla is alleging.

>In about the past week, Tesla has discovered disturbing pattern of employees who are departing for Rivian surreptitiously stealing Tesla trade secret, confidential, and proprietary information — information that is especially useful for startup electric vehicle company. And Rivian encourages those thefts even though Rivian is well aware of Tesla employees’ confidentiality obligation

Even then, state trade secret acts can be more protective.You should have been a lawyer instead of reddit shit poster.Edit: nvm, US is dumb. Public can't benefit from discoveries while also allowing finder to profit.With you.> in this case the secret may not even be a secret

and if this "method" is patented, then company A won't have the problem of company B trying to steal it. Company A wants to retain the knowledge forever, and profit off it. I dont think it's in the interest of society to have this sort of trade secret tbh.A trade secret is legally protected that's why there is a lawsuitHey, I'm not saying that Tesla is in the right in this particular case.  A court would need to hear the arguments.

My point is just that there needs to be a balance.  An employer can't keep you from working for somebody else.  However, that doesn't mean that it is ok to be mining former employees for company secrets either.  I have no idea whether the latter happened in this particular case, but it certainly is reasonable for a court to hear the argument.Except not when trade secrets are at play. You aren't allowed to hire someone and use them to extract trade secrets from a competitor. As someone else in the thread pointed out, if you could do that then company A could do a billion dollars worth of research, and company B could come over and offer a 10 million signing bonus to come over and share the results. 

If they're changing employers and conforming to their NDA then yeah, no problem. But in an emerging tech like EVs, it would be damned hard as an engineer to basically work with your hands tied behind your back by ignoring better ways to do things that you picked up from your ex employer.Not functionally in the real world though. It often leads to employees getting fired soon after if A wins. B gets sued and might fire the employee as well anyhow. If your girl leaves her now ex for you, that's a bad sign.

Plus the budget interests are so unequal. Bidding wars are only real during the hiring process of A vs B, and even then barely.

In the real world these theoretical ideas fall short at best. I've worked with way too many startups trying to "get the best". Many times it's a circlejerk without a point. Unless you trying to up your payroll expenses by 100%. And even then, another circle.> broad NDAs (ex: you cant ever share anything you see or hear or learn while working here) effectively arent enforceable

Do you have a citation for this?

As far as I'm aware it isn't legal to share what was going on at your former employer simply because you didn't sign a new NDA every year.In California they only restrict non-competes, you can’t disclose trade secrets post employmentGood luck.Why?That’s why you have a free market with protections for innovation. The trademark, copyright and patent policy of the US has caused major innovation due to its legal protections. Companies and people have incentive to invest into innovation. 

Not saying people don’t abuse the system, but when it’s working well, it really pushes progress/r/Woooosh 

(sorry)All good and that’s a great point about employee mining.Stifles innovation and the spread of ideas. If an idea is so critical to the success of your business that you cant let anyone else see it, the onus is on you to take the necessary steps to protect it.> The trademark, copyright and patent policy of the US has caused major innovation due to its legal protections.

Except it hasn't. The vast majority of innovative research and development happens in publicly funded agencies and universities, and the results are largely open to exploitation from the market.

>Not saying people don’t abuse the system, but when it’s working well, it really pushes progress

Not on any significant scale.Not really. I'm pretty sure u/enleeten was suggesting we use patents as those last a certain number of years. Since trade secrets are not registered they do not expire. In this case Tesla likely made a choice to keep something a trade secret and protect it as such to specifically not have to disclose the secret in a patent filling.Good luck getting companies to spend billions in R&D just so some slouch can come along and take all the profits.Do me a favor and google the stats for copyrights and patents and let me know where the publicly funded research falls on who has the most patents, copyrigjts etc.

I’m not saying you’re wrong, innovation in some areas is driven by research universities and the public sector (behavioral sciences, NASA, etc). But on the whole, when we think of innovation at the “start-up” level, PTO protections are crucial at incentivizing this investment

If you don’t believe me, look at the data on countries without protections and where they don’t honor protections of other countries and see how diluted they get and how little actual progress is made internallyoh i seeWhat are they doing so wrong that some slouch can manage to take their most important secrets?> Do me a favor and google the stats for copyrights and patents and let me know where the publicly funded research falls on who has the most patents, copyrigjts etc.

You know that only really supports my point, right? Yes, I am aware that companies will patent every single minor variation of every single product. That's the problem.

>But on the whole, when we think of innovation at the “start-up” level, PTO protections are crucial at incentivizing this investment

You're thinking of micro-innovation, which the free market does indeed excel at.

Nope.  If you buy gold in the US, for example, and the dollar devalues, the gold doesn't automatically become worth less yen. The price of gold is simply inflated by the excess dollars.

Youre not holding dollars.If you live on the USD, stocks will hedge against inflation

If don't live on the USD, inflation will cause a loss to the value of your stocks (broadly speaking)

> Youre not holding dollars

No I'm not holding the actual currency, but I am holding USD denominated investments. When the USD is slipping, its a loss>When the USD is slipping, its a loss

Not if the equities are worth more dollars> Not if the equities increase in value.

... faster than the dollar loses it relative to your home currencyThats how it works for every asset....Every asset traded in a foreign currencyNo. every single asset other than the final currency you want.That's correctThat includes every other hedge you could come up with. I'm saying US equities aren't different than anything other asset you could hold as a hedge just bc you have to trade them in dollars.**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

Imo Disney is fine but buy in over time. We keep going through cycles of optimism and pessimism that makes timing the market a nightmare, so buy into your desired position over a while. The Starbucks balance sheet is scary to me, and also the true recession prospect along with work from home movement make me bearish on Starbucks. But it should be fine, like it’s not going bankrupt. Since big tech just dipped and is likely to dip into/following the congressional hearing, I’d keep my eyes on them. Just my opinion.**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

I had some small amount as a hedge and started buying more when I felt that the Robinhood speculators are starting to rotate into it.

Yes, it has come to this... Buying an asset not based on its outlook, but to sell to the next greater fool.5 years: massive growth, 10 years: *massiver* growthSpeculators don't believe hyper inflation is coming.  Where do you take that from? Why aren't inflation adjusted t-bills soaring? Gold is good due to low yields and high uncertainty.The reason you own gold is because no counter party risk. Hence why it's superior to the 10y as a store of value. By buying paper gold, Like GLD, you re-introduce counter party risk from the custodian, being HSBC. So physical is better than paper as a store of value 


Gold is gonna break out of the ATH and soar past $2K as the economic problems will get far worst.Money printers are going crazy all over the world and bonds yield close to nothing. Of course you want to have some gold in your portfolioI think you either have physical or gold miners/royalties.

ETF's are somewhat dicey given the counterparty risk. Of course in short term they can be a reasonable vehicle for gains.

By the way for those interested we have a new forum at  [https://www.reddit.com/r/pmstocks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pmstocks/) where we discuss this kind of thing in more detail.I am extremely bullish on gold and silver for the next couple of years. Gold's rally for the last couple of years has been really based on economic uncertainty and artificially low yields set by the central bank which means bonds are no longer the desirable safe haven assets they used to be. 

If you look at today with the COVID-19 crisis and QE unlimited, I see gold having A LOT MORE UPSIDE potential now than they ever did in the years post 2009. Right now we are in an economic crisis that isn't gonna go away in the next quarter or so (unlike what the equity market is implying) and the reason why so many of us haven't felt its full impact yet is due to the generous government assistance programs like PPP and the $600 weekly unemployment boost. The problem here is that those programs are unsustainable and will be highly unlikely to continue as is going into next year due to the sheer size its blowing up the deficit by. That combined with equities that are trading well above their fundamental values and bonds yielding 0%, theres really no where else to park your money because you're not gonna yield anything holding cash. 

Also you can make the argument that the money being printed will eventually leak to the real economy causing inflation but that is a topic for another day.Can gold give me returns like AMZN?I’ve been adding paper gold to my portfolio over the last couple months. I thought it would benefit from the FED printing money and that seems to be correct so far. 

I’m planning to start selling when my gains reach about 20%, treating the paper gold as any other position. I like to keep about 10% of my portfolio in Gold so I’ll likely hold on to that.

And to you last point I do prefer physical gold but I’ve been treating this as more of a short term play so paper gold is just fine.Rational people own gold not as a strong "investment" but as a store of value in place of cash.  At some point, the large increase in the money supply will work its way into the real economy.  Whether it happens next year or 20 years from now there will be significant (although not hyper) inflation, im thinking 4-7% annually.  I dont see gold breaking out necessarily but should steadily rise as inflation rises.I hope we inflate so my stocks will be worth more and easier to pay my credit card debt lolI need a larger upvote button for this.The rising geopolitical tensions have definitely played a part in golds rise. You haven’t seen anyone discussing hyperinflation and the collapse of the dollar? Seems to be everywhere I look.Just Ron Paul and other conspiracy theorists. These have no influence on the market. Some do believe the USD will struggle but thats something that can play out over many many years, even decades.>Why aren't inflation adjusted t-bills soaring?


VIPIX is soaring.

The DXY is crashing. 

Gold will make all time highs, my shiny pet rock is going to outperform your portfolioI agree physical > paper. You seem confident gold will continue to go up, do you have any plans to sell?Miners are a great gold play for long term.Probably not, but it will outperform equity indices in the futureI have about 5% of my retirement in miners and about 2% in paper gold. Ray Dalio keeps a decent amount of paper gold in his portfolio too.The dollar has no bottom and thus gold has no ceiling.I appreciate youConsider this: the 10 year tips break even is 1.48%.  Which means the consensus in institutional money is that inflation will sit right around there over the next decade.  

So one must ask who is right?  Institutional money or the masses of forum participants discussing hyperinflation?> You haven’t seen anyone discussing hyperinflation and the collapse of the dollar?

Before hyperinflation, you'd see some regular amounts of inflation first.Ron Paul has no influence on broader markets, yet gold is knocking on the door of ATH and then break the dam of $2K. 

You can't explain that.Visit isnt soaring much more than normal bonds,is it?Not anytime soon, gold is gonna excel in an environment of central banks backstopping the crappiest of junk bonds.

Right now I'm looking at gold $2,500 but there is so much systemic risk on the horizon once things like mortgage protections start to roll off.I'd say for 1-3 year horizon, after that depending on the desperation factor countries may start to nationalize.Great point.No one can explain why Pearl Jam is neither a secretion in oysters nor a fruity spread on toast, yet gold is knocking on the door of ATH and then break the damn of $2K.Lol whatCorrect, it’s trivially easy to see who knows what they’re talking about when you know where to look. 


https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10YIEAll bonds are going up, but the TIPS are out performing.

But it doesn't matter as negative yielding bonds have something gold doesn't, risk. Gold has a positive carry also. Risk parity trade is dead.Where do you go about buying physical precious metals?The best thing you can ever learn is places like Reddit have a huge issue with signal to noise ratio.  The overwhelming majority of people you’ll see here offering their analysis likely didn’t even know the concepts they’re discussing existed six months ago.  The best thing you can do is learn to identify information from informed participants.Because pearl jam is overrated. They were never near as good as AlicenChaimsYou said gold is a Ron Paul trade, it appears to be an international trader trade.I meant the inflation of bond prices, like a digital money printer creating inflation in bond markets.Carry as a concept in finance is basically the difference in interest cost and payments, or effectively the interest profit.  Gold does not have carry at all, it is an asset with no cash flows.

Also risk parity has nothing to do with a given asset class in particular. 


What I’m saying is it’s super clear you don’t understand the words you tried to use, and just threw in some finance words so people that also didn’t understand them might think you were making an insightful statement.Soundgarden for my money.Nah I said believing in hyper inflation is a Ron Paul thing.No you didn’t, but y’all are all the same.   Whenever you’re wrong it’s all “Fed made the market do this”.**Hi, welcome to /r/investing. Please note that as a topic focused subreddit we have higher posting standards than much of Reddit:**

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*So in the short term these lower continuing numbers seem to be good for the economy but it is important to remember that some of these continuing claims are not ending due to people finding work. Many of them are like where I will be in two weeks where all benefits have run out and I cannot claim unemployment anymore. I thus won’t count as a number but I won’t have money coming in. 

This is going to be very bad for the economyThat is a lot of unemployed people. You have to feel for them. No one could have expected this.The initial jobless numbers are not great: 
Initial jobless claims, week ended July 18: 1.416 million vs. 1.3 million expected and 1.307 million during the prior weekSo New unemployment claims are UP by 100k (from last week) But continuing claims are down. I wish they broke down the numbers regionally because I assume Covid spikes are seeing a spike in Unemployment while other areas like NY are ending claims. I do expect the first UI for August to wayyy down on continuing claims. A lot of systems only allow for 3 months before the state benefits dry up .Until white collar workers get affected, nobody is going to care. Markets won’t react to Main StreetThere's 16m people continued to be unemployed an the extra 600/week is ending at the end of this month.

That is not bullish.The official report has plenty of data for the economic nerds out there. 

https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/OPA/newsreleases/ui-claims/20201453.pdf


I feel so desensitized from the numbers already:

The total number of people claiming benefits in all programs for the week ending July 4 was **31,802,715**, a decrease of
200,615 from the previous week. There were **1,725,953** persons claiming benefits in all programs in the comparable
week in 2019. 

The largest increases in initial claims for the week ending July 11 were in Florida (+65,890), Georgia (+33,292),
California (+20,123), Washington (+16,116), and Indiana (+6,258), while the largest decreases were in Maryland
(-13,728), Texas (-11,583), New Jersey (-8,577), Michigan (-6,882), and Louisiana (-5,066).I am proud to say that after losing my job due to covid I was able to land a job with a better work life balance. Only took about 2.5 months but I blanketed companies with resumes and tapped into my network.Still pretty fucking high16.2 million is a good number because they expected 17.1 million, but if they had expected 15.3 million then 16.2 million would be bad?Doesn’t the PPP loan end in August? I would expect more layoffs to come once we get thereWe open red and finish green as usual

Edit : We RektIt’s not very exciting to beat such low expectations.a lot of the unemployment is running out.  It only covers 13 weeks in some states.>Initial July claim: 1.416 mil vs 1.3 mil expected (This means first-time unemploymenr insurance benefit filings) 
>Continuing claims: 16.197 mil vs 17.1 mil expected

Should we be added continuing claims and new claims for this week?  

Total for this week is 17,163k jobless claims (initial plus continuing).

Last week: New Claims: 1,300K, Continuing claims: 17,338K, Total Claims: 18,638k

There are 1,475k less people making jobless claims this week compared to last week.It’s not going to get better until things change. The line is being drawn and the new elites are falling into old habits. 
Humans are so short sighted for being able to predict the future outcomes of frameworks.Please post the real, DOL link.I don’t get these weekly and monthly jobless claims as well as expectations. This is insanity to me. Why are people focused so much on rates. The total amount of unemployed Americans since March and are still currently unemployed is 🤯US daily death higher: 100 daily by now vs 1200Expected? There's a fucking typo on the title...jeezuz khristI too can expect a lower amount on my salary every two weeks and be pleasantly surprised that it's higher

&#x200B;

lmaoPermanent job loss is up and unemployment benefits are down starting Friday. It’s really too bad for a lot of people in the US right now. I’m not feeling bullish.Not surprising since the unemployment supplement is going away and people are now forced to risk their health for shelter / food.[removed]The expectations were to high but the jobless is way to high regardlessBuy! Buy! Buy!U ob0That's the seasonally adjusted number. The non-seasonally adjusted number went up MoM, and there's a pretty solid reason to believe the seasonal adjustment this year might be off.Better than expected but this is still truly awful news for the economy long term. Over 16m is huge numbers of unemployment..Eventually people will get their jobs back, predicting when though is a bit of a gamble lol especially in florida16M? Lower? Is this weekly, monthly? 16M is a lotThis literally says nothing.There are still a lot of people having trouble getting UI. Could that be keeping the numbers low? I don't know enough about how they count claims.Have you factored in the amount of people being in pay role for PPP reasons into your calculus OP?It will be interesting to watch and see how /r/investing trys to reconcile this. Usually the jobs data is garbage if its good, while an herald of the end times if its bad.

So what will the circlejerk be when continuing claims are lower than expected (good - thus we are supposed to hate it) while initial claims are higher than expected (bad - thus we should embrace it as a herald of doom)?

Edit: Once again, I'm 100% on target - there is so much mental contortion going on in this thread with people trying to figure out how to spin this into economic doom porn.Jesus christ. This is the worst economic crisis we have ever had.


Call it wishful thinking but if the economy can decline so fast, then it can bounce back so fast aswell.Fintech layoffs ? Very interesting, almost hard to believe considering everyone keeps saying fin tech is the future and there’s soo much demand for fintech talent wKawhi o zShort puts on anything jobs and trump as china will make sure trump is out in 3 monthsHmm wonder why ppl are jobless?! Stop paying them more to be jobless then they make when they work. They wont because dumbacrats want thins to be shit until they can lie their way into power potentiallyAnd does this include  the people that are back to work with reduced hours? That have never qualified? I certainly doesn't talk about those to be laid off?  Southwest airlines is in the process of  cutting 100k jobs for example. The shit is not done hitting the fan by a long shotIts interesting how a million people filed, but two million found jobsIf you're unemployed why wouldn't you be able to claim unemployment?Don't these numbers reflect first-time filers?

So people who fall off unemployment aren't counted regardlessTruer words never spoken.

My 30+ year career is being a sound guy.  You know, for concerts and large meetings of people.  I haven't had a gig since early march.  My next gig is penciled in for late October.> No one could have expected this.

Some people, including Bill Gates, have been warning that we are not ready for a respiratory pandemic for years.

Nobody could have predicted when, but there’s people who definitely saw this coming.Uhh except ya know... the government who was warned by the CDC team in China but refused to do anything. Or Italy when it was on lockdown a whole month before us... 

Lol 

If every state just issued mandatory masks when in public with steep fines, we’d be fine.It is a lot, but given how much of the economy is effectively shuttered due to COVID, it's shocking to me that the number isn't 2 or 3 times higher. 

And it's surprising how fast the continuing claims are declining.[removed]I assume a portion of unemployed are choosing to be unemployed as they are earning far more in unemployment benefits + bonus than going to work (minus expenses such as travel and child care).I don't want to sound insensitive and I fully understand the pain of most unemployed people (I am one myself at the moment), but this coronavirus and lockdown has been a financial blessing for me personally.

I got laid off in June and got almost 4 months additional salary as a part of my severance package and I just recently secured another job a few days back with higher salary and will be starting soon. The amount that I received in total and was able to save and invest is much more than if I still had my old job.we (USA) did have a 2 month heads up.na the majority is kids who were never employed ..fake news


jk but i feel thats how the market sees itIdk man. It’s time to start paying attention to history and science. See what’s gonna pop up.

*Volcanoes stopping air travel 
*Major hurricane hitting major city
*Megadrought
*Rise of fascism
*Rise of foreign fascism
*Other countries bribing government officials
*Country using a nuclear weapon
*Viral Pandemic
*Dumb politician wrecking country
*Rich people buying up more and more of the wealth
*Tsunami
*Mass unemployment due to lack of resources


There is plenty of shit that can go wrong. To assume that people’s shitty lives can’t get shittier is naive. And people with shitty lives need to prepare for that.True, no one thought we'd shut down for a virus less infectious than the flu.On August 1st there will most likely be massive layoffs.I think it’s a double edged sword that the number is dropping - sure, we want less people to be unemployed for economic and societal reasons. But you really have to ask if all of these people are going back to work too soon. We’ve already seen clear cut cases where several states reopened far too fast, far too early - like Texas and Arizona.>No one could have expected this.

\*No one could have expectee this.Let's give a special shout out and thanks to the governors of California / New York for keeping a big portion of their economies closed for 4+ months and destroying the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of their residents!

The odds of a pandemic restarting in their states are incredibly high even after they've bankrupted hundreds of their small businesses. Just delaying the inevitable.> No one could have expected this.

Wait you guys really didn't see this coming? They said we'd need to do shelter-in-place for 6-18 months back in February...A lot of people expected this actually...I think your last sentence could be debated, or rephrased at least. No one wanted this. But this was a worst case scenario in the "what could happen" that unfortunately was drowned outRight. This is the first week out of 15 that the weekly number has risen more than expected. Which is not a good signal about employment in general. This is a result of pullback from Covid spikes for sure.I think some states put out their own unemployment numbers. Digging through that data would be a pain though...[deleted]That's definitely the impression I'm getting but I don't really know what's going on. Surely they can sense their own finances being jeopardized...Hospitality and marketing/advertising have seen tons of white collar layoffs. The market doesn't care because of stimulus.Lots of salaries have been cut.. it’s definitely impacting a lot of white collar workers, which in turn slows the recovery for blue collar workers. 
[salary cuts](https://www.fastcompany.com/90500004/pandemic-pay-cuts-the-growing-list-of-companies-reducing-salaries-during-covid-19)White-collar has been affected. Ive seen tons of companies laying off people at well-paying jobs. Linkedin just laid off 1,000 people.They havent been?

Major companies in my industry have laid off significant portions of their workforces.Price follows earnings. Lots of companies haven't reduced earnings substantially, so far.We’ll likely have a reduction in the total size of the workforce as the 50+ year olds can’t find a new role.It won't end. Most that will happen is it gets cut in half.I bet there is a huge continued unemployed drop next week. Everyone freaking out their gravy train is about to end and they will have to go back to work.So sell for right now and then buy when shit hits the fan?I think we're all *way* too desensitized to all of this. Reality hasn't sunk in yet.

Almost 32 *million* people are on unemployment. I mean, holy shit!Congrats!Which industries did you jump from / to?Yeah I am looking at this as a new chapter! I was let go from a great job where I was making good money and had goals. Now I know what I am worth and what I can offer and aiming bigger than ever. I been sending so many resumes out with no luck yet but I have a feeling I will find something.High level comment, thank youYou sound like my girlfriendWhich states?In Ohio at least, extended is good until the end of December.It's simple.

TBH, the numbers are couched in terminology that, if I were paranoid, I'd say were designed to not necessarily be misleading but certainly make you go "Wait a minute, slow down and repeat that..."Are you asking yahoo finance or the US government 🤔?Are peoples' unemployment benefits running out a good thing?

r/investing 
r/investingWish in one hand and s*** in the other see which one fills up fasterThis is an incredibly dumb comment. I didnt ask for Covid to lay me off nor did anybody else. I didnt ask to lose my seniority at the company I was at. I didnt ask to buy a house and then lose my job. I didn't ask to make less than half of what I was making bc I'd rather be on unemployment. I didn't ask for no call backs or interviews to the 100's of applications ive sent out.

Go fuck yourself you shitstain. People like you deserve the gulag.Where are you getting southwest cutting 100k jobs? They only have 61k employees.Two million people didn't find jobs. Two million people stopped filing unemployment insurance claims. 

That's a huge difference.It only lasts for a set period of time.well there are some state regulations that can disqualify you from unemployment like gig workers, part time etc. and not to mention that the unemployment website is almost constantly down. I know people who've been on the phone and spamming the website for months with no availThere's a limit to how long you can claim unemploymentYou could be one of the poor souls living in Florida.There's several states that are still backlogged.In my case I lost my job in January with a contracting firm when they had their contract cut and there was no other position to put me in

I'm in the National Guard so I was planning on just finding some random trainings to go to here and there to get some more experience and some spending cash while I'm finishing up my degree. All my training got canceled for March and I didn't even bother looking since since I figured it was all canceled. Since I'm not full time with the guard and was only doing "extra" I was told I didn't qualify for unemployment even though I've lost out on thousands of dollars of income at this point. I'm lucky I had savings or I'd be screwed. Still upset that I'm not quite as fiscally sound as I wanted, but I'll make itThey might be referring to the extended benefits of $600 a week in the US, this is due to end with the month of JulyFunny because in England being a sound guy means being a top blokeAs a photographer, I haven't had one since Mid-February. I was close to one during that month but we all know what happened.I work big events in tech, I feel bad for the thousands of backstage crew people who are out of work. I've now switched over to putting on virtual events, but the guys I usually work with aren't so lucky.I feel your pain. I own a catering company, specializing in weddings and large events, and also do a ton of catering on site for a large college football program. We had double digit weddings cancelled, football season could be scrapped, and nobody is holding large events now. People talk a lot about the restaurant industry suffering, but the event industry has been hit the worst of any industry there is. People are still going out to eat or getting to go. Events aren’t happening at all. If the govt doesn’t do something serious to help out this industry it’ll cease to exist by the time this is all overRight, and then you think about the next layer of pain...there was just an auction here (sf bay area) of an entire rental house's inventory. Had to stop myself from buying a lot of gear I don't need at pennies on the dollar.

And then I get emails daily (I'm a lampie at times, don't judge) from Chamys -- "new arena-scale console, sign up for training seminar" and I'm thinking, damn absolutely NOBODY is gonna be buying that shit right now.I'm a DP, I feel your painOh, you're doing sound for your state's mass funeral?I’m part of the events industry. I’m lucky because my non event work is keeping me very busy, but I’ve been watching as almost everyone in my professional circle suffocates from the complete halt of all meetings, conferences and special events.

Many are in their late career and will probably never come back. It’s brutal.Have you looked up sounding videos on pornhub?Yeah there's an entire branch of epidemiology devoted to pandemic respiratory pathogens. Lots of people definitely predicted this. 

But also the media is making way too many rosy claims about the economy while people are still getting giant UE/stimulus supplements. The real impact of all of this isn't going to be for several more months when people are no longer getting paid $22/hr on unemployment, small businesses are no longer getting funds, stimulus checks are no longer a thing, and payment forbearances are over.> Some people, including Bill Gates, have been warning that we are not ready for a respiratory pandemic for years.

Here's the 2015 video where Gates explains that the likelihood of a serious global pandemic in his lifetime is over 50%: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AEMKudv5p0

Here's his TED talk in 2015 warning us that we aren't ready: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Af6b_wyiwIExactly this.  As well, for months it spread from China, through Europe and we in North America still didn't prepare properly with all that warning.  Pure incompetence.Gates even gave a TED talk that predicted this with frightening accuracy in 2015. I believe this is partially why the Obama team had a pandemic response team and information put together before he left office.> Some people, including Bill Gates

HE GONNA CHIP YOU ALL WITH HIS DEADLY VACCINE

/sThere's a difference between seeing a possibility of something happening and predicting it. Say if you said our financial system is fragile and market valuations are high, if the market crashed 2 years later, I wouldn't consider that as you predicted it.Depends on what "this" means here. I'm a layman with respect to biology and viruses, but just a little internet surfing told me that we were overdue for a respiratory illness of global proportions. Even mr nobody (me) definitely understood it could happen. 1918 was not a one-time event; it was at least a once-in-a-century bug that would probably become more and more likely to reoccur with the increase in livestock and chicken farming, etc.

But knowing what it really might look like? Nope, I didn't have a clue. Mass unemployment? Business shut downs? Full scale economic fallout? I could have told you it would probably *affect* the economy, but I couldn't have told you the scale or magnitude.

Just thoughts.The people in power had a responsibility to expect this and plan for it and execute on that plan.

But OP was talking about the people making 10 an hour in fields that don't exist anymorethe naysayers always looks so smart because when theyre wrong people ignore them, when theyre right they sound like geniuses.

Just like those people who who the stock market is going to crash every year. year after year.[removed]I was going to say it was obviously sarcasm, then I remembered what sub I was in.Yeah, remember when everybody was out trying to get masks and the top experts at the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  and the CDC came out and told us all that masks weren’t needed and the only people that should wear masks were people with active signs of sickness and those taking care of them as they weren’t necessary or helpful for healthy people.  Then they came out months later and said, that in fact masks did help, but they didn’t want people buying and hoarding them so that there was enough left over for essential workers.  It’s almost like they hid the scientific facts from us and told us the opposite thing in order to service  a government agenda, and then get upset when people don’t trust scientists to give us honest truth and facts without a hidden agenda.

Not to mention the World Health Organization praising China for their transparency and openess and the wonderful job they were doing to control the virus....followed by calling the US raceist for closing its boarders to Travellers from China.

It’s like we all forget that we were trying to shut down and wear masks until the scientific community fucked it up.[removed]Yes, those people are in my immediate circle of friends.

I’m kicking it my friend’s place right now who tried to get fired after the pandemic assistance was announced. She figured if she could collect $4k/mo without working, why not. Unfortunately for her she couldn’t get herself fired because her job was and is short people.I quit in June due to having to move and they said I couldn't do the same job at home from another state. So I filed for unemployment and am getting great money doing nothing now while quarantined in Hawaii. I had been doing the same IT job at home for covid and could do it anywhere in the world. But they said no not in hawaii. So now I'm sitting here saving money for doing nothing. Luckily we have family here for a free place to stay.It’s because of those damned Zonies that want to come to our beaches spreading that Zonie virus.Also seasonal adjustmentsI'm wondering how if it will drop in the coming weeks. I know atleast for myself and some friends, our managers brought us back only PT so we can still claim the $600. Returning to FT work next week.Covid spikes in the three most populous states in the US too: California, Texas, Florida. That's more than 1/4th of the US population, so it obviously has a big impact on overall numbers. Luckily a few of those are giving indicators they have peaked.If that was the case why are continuing claims down?This is such a patently untrue statement.

In order to continue to receive benefits, you normally have to show that you are making an effort to find a job, and you cannot turn down a job that is close in salary to your previous salary. This means showing proof of resumes sent and applications filled out, and the states do check on these because they don't want to be paying unemployment. 

So in reality, people who were already receiving low wages and have been forced to apply to places like Walmart for work just to meet the requirements to continue to receive unemployment have probably been offered positions since major chain retailers have continued to hire during these times. Should they not accept, they lose the benefits.

You don't get to just lounge around the house and hit the beach while on unemployment. I don't know why so many people have this idea in their heads, but it needs to stop being spread because it's completely detached from the reality of the situation.If you turn down a job on unemployment, the employer can report you and you can lose all benefits.

Also, people tend to take the safe route. A job is consistent and unemployment runs out. So most people who can work, take the job rather than staying on unemployment.

There may be a few bad apples gaming the system, but the majority of people don't do that. 

The Republican talking point "unemployment causes people to not want to work" isn't backed up by evidence.White collar worker jobs are getting ready to get axed. Companies are going to start looking at downsizing soon. That’s when most Americans will wake up. Nike just announced its going to be laying people off.

In my state you’re awarded 120-275 a week plus the 600 pua pay. It’s going to be a big dip due to people going from a monthly income of $2880-$3500 to $480- $1100 where that’s not even half of most peoples rent.So how is 16 million continuing on government assistance bullish?[removed]Here's the breakdown.

I think 26 is average.  I must have divided by two because I was thinking paychecks.I understand that. What I don’t get is stock markets or people in general comparing these monthly jobless claims to indicate whether things are getting better or not. They’re not. Total unemployed since March is a bigger picture rather than rate.Yeah even that article wasn't straight forward.Uh-huh. It couldn't be that people on continuing claims found jobs - it must just mean that unemployment is running out!

The problem is we know how many claims are coming from each state and we know what each state has for UI claim limits. Guess what? When you do the math, almost no one has been on UI long enough yet for the benefits to expire. Try again!🐑🐑Its not my fault I went to college and got a job with some job security even if I had lost my job I woulda found two more to replace it because Im not a lazy system sucking leech. Adapt and survive or keep cashing your unemployment sheep just stop acting like you have it tough or deserve more. There are jobs out there plenty!And why would that happen before even the $600 ended?I'm from the UK so I'm not that familiar with the US system. I understand that the $600 benefit ends this month, although I don't think that's what we're talking about here. Can you not claim unemployment benefit indefinitely if you're actively looking for a job?

In the UK you just have to "prove" you're looking for work and you'll be entitled to job seekers allowance. I guess it's different in the US?You can claim unemployment until December 31 2020 because of the CARES act.

No one is ending their claims this year unless they got a job.To be fair, this is an accurate statement regardless of pandemic.username checks out.In the US, it is sometimes used as well. "His business is sound."What does being a 'top bloke' mean?in America it just means he won't rape you.My October gig is planned as a virtual meeting for Home Depot.I feel for you. My family owns a catering business that’s been around for nearly 60 years.

We're now stuck in their shitty loop of denial, with nothing but, "everything's fine, do what you want, open up" coming from Washington, while cases are still spiking in several regions and there is an uncoordinated response on a state by state level.

There is no sight of a new round being sent out either.Plus the ppp money has got to be propping up employment to some extent right?Mexico, because it’s so dependent on low value manufacturing and tourism, hasn’t had the luxury of being able to shut down like the US.

Those requirements have been waived in a lot of states due to the pandemic.  Why would you force people to be seeking and taking jobs when the very reason they’re out of work is because no one is supposed to be out and interacting?I have a friend who filed for unemployment. The only thing the state does is ask for the names of the jobs you applied for, that’s it. He’s milking the unemployment just like a lot of people are. People will be hurting once it ends this month.

Can confirm in PA you don't have to show you are actively looking for a job during this lockdown.

They have been getting axed. Lots of engineering positions at various places up and down silicon valley have already been cut.I wonder if some tech heavy businesses that can mostly or fully WFH will look into closing their offices before laying anyone off.LinkedInNothing in Financial services however. Still very strong, especially bankingMore likely is companies scale up remote work and downsize their overhead spending on office space. Sure some white collar jobs will get cut, and not all white collar jobs can be done fully remotely, but at this point a lot of businesses are looking at the rent payments they're making for cubicles people are not sitting in.  Some companies would come out ahead even if they have to break lease contracts.  Not all will go t 100% remote work require, but many companies could reduce he # of floors they lease and focus on creating touchdown work stations and meeting/collaboration rooms for folks that need the in-person experience for a project.Most businesses are announce 5% reductions in work forces. I don’t think it’s THAT big.Software/IT 

Lots of furlough/layoffs in IT, like in any recession.

IT markets are more accurately assessed by looking at markets served. So if youre in IT and serve medical, legal, etc, youre busier than ever. If retail or hospitality, youre hosed.

Communities are full of job search posts as well as new businesses being created by laid off internal IT ppl.

Also, plenty of layoffs and furloughs in fintech (anecdotally, most of my neighbors and friends work in fintech).

And I wouldnt call most of it part of "creative destruction," and the parts that are in that category are still destructive and happened over a very short amount of time compared to such instances not fueled by a pandemic.

https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/06/11/unemployment-rose-higher-in-three-months-of-covid-19-than-it-did-in-two-years-of-the-great-recession/

The debate around reportable figures for unemployment also add to the vaguery of assessing impact.

They broke it down by education, which isnt very helpful since menial, low skill jobs can require a bachelor's.

It would be great to see a report on employment based on income.

My neighbors and friends were all earning 100k and being out of work is rather foreign to them all (good workers).

The impact is always greater the lower on the socioeconomic scale you go, but the expectation is that we are still shifting and adjusting and white collar jobs have not yet seen the peak of losses both to the shift still being in progress and the debate of the segmentations.Well on the cynical side, it's a simulation of a population that now actually has a living wage.  So that's bullish until the sim stops or burns out.Those 16 million people are still spending money, whether they got it from the remaining taxpayers, or from a job. This is bullish for larger companies that dominate the market.Your submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

What it said, in useful terms:

Claims from people already on unemployment dropped, meaning they went back to work or just stopped claiming for whatever reason. This number is less than expected, which should be good.

New claims from people just laid off are up about 100,000. This number is more than expected, which may be bad.

* all numbers are probably massaged, ymmv...> The problem is we know how many claims are coming from each state and we know what each state has for UI claim limits. Guess what? When you do the math, almost no one has been on UI long enough yet for the benefits to expire. Try again!

I guess you're assuming no one was on unemployment before covid hit and the CARES act was passed.Lol your college education hasnt done much for you. Clearly you must have cheated your way to a degree. Only the braindead and boomers think like you. It's a shame the Rona hasn't taken your life.they died of COVID so could no longer fileSome people are running out and get dropped before they get the extended thing approvedNo our unemployemnt runs out after approx 26 weeks. It's been extended another 13 weeks ontop of that then it runs out again.Yeah. If you've been unemployed too long. You just suck. Suck it up and be better! 

/sIt varies from state to state, with the Republican states usually having the worst policies. For example, in my shithole of Missouri, your maximum weekly benefit is $320 which is less than a minimum wage job. Missouri also only provides it for 20 weeks.I obviously haven't read the cares act, but I was under the impression that it gave states the OPTION of extending benefits to 39 weeks (rather than the typical 26). If that's right, then I can guess which states chose not to extend them. 

If you're right, and every state was forced to extend, then maybe this person was already on unemployment beforehand? 

Either way there is a limit on how long you can claim unemploymentDoesn't PUA, part time, self employed and contractors, run out for most people this week, and a few states last week??Do you have a source on that? From what I’ve seen, it’s only the lengths of benefits being extended.What happens Jan 1 is you still don't have a job?

Jobless claims for the month definitely seem like they should be pretty bad when they come out next month, but I bet they're going to have a signed stimulus not long after you see the market impact from that (at this rate the day that comes out might well be your first day that goes -300 to -500 on the DOW minimum in what at least feels like a long time).

Edit: I might end up being wrong. LmaoOr maybe people could wear fucking masks and we find a nice middle ground.Just keep printing money, what's the worst that could happen?

/s in case it isn't obvious.Really curious what exactly it would take to make all you doom porn lovers happy. Would you rather no central bank response and no government stimulus? We tried that it was called the Great Depression.The senate is releasing a stimulus package plan today. Looks like stimulus checks will be about the same as they were before and they're extending UE benefits but knocking it from $600/wk to $200-400/wk.It's probably the main reason I still have a job (i'm the second highest paid guy in a struggling small company, and I expect to be laid off along with maybe a couple others in the next month once I'm no longer "free".)Actually the WHO changed their guidance about masks much later than the CDC.  They changed their stance on June 5th.  To put that in context of the stupid scale, that’s 9 days after Sean Hannity changed his stance on masks and 45 days before Trump did.[removed]He's not, or if he is, his story is completely false.I got unemployment when I left (quit) the military voluntarilyCan you source that? Am curios as to where you got that information.The CARES Act simply stated that states "should consider" relaxing that requirement, yet most states have not, or have language about returning to work as soon as offered their position back.

I agree with you that we should not be forcing people to go out looking for work during a pandemic. The sad reality is that our government has failed to safeguard both the physical and economic well-being of its people, and the states do not have unlimited funds with which to cover continued unemployment. Nor do many businesses have the ability to remain permanently shuttered during the crisis, so many people are being told to come back when they shouldn't. 

Do you think an employer is going to allow a worker who has been offered their position back to continue to collect benefits?

edit - pdoherty is not wrong, and I've removed my assertion that what they said is incorrect.Yeah I can’t believe anyone thinks they really need to look for a job. You can bullshit those forms so easily. It’s free money.Because can’t you just apply to jobs you know you won’t get?  Like I could apply to CFO roles even though I only have 6 years work experience and I know I won’t get the job.That's great, but Washington state has less than 400,000 currently unemployed. Florida has 1.4 million unemployed and benefits are **capped** at $275 a week for 12 weeks.Anecdotal experience is anecdotal.

I've been on unemployment before, so I know first hand how it works. If you want to go by anecdotal experience, the majority of people I know who applied for unemployment benefits still haven't received them in many states, even after two months of applying and being approved.Cool story. All the people I know collecting the extra UI are actively looking for jobs, including myself. Stop making generalizations. Thanks.My company is tech-adjacent and we've basically sold our office to go full remote. I think even non-tech heavy businesses could as well. 

The challenge though is that remote work is very different from in-office work. Side conversations and other organic forms of communication don't happen the same way, so you need to be much more deliberate about how you're communicating and organized.

Also, most successful remote companies I know of focus on working asynchronously, which I think is a hard thing to get used to from a management perspective when you're used to working synchronously.From what I've been reading, it looks like there's a consensus forming that businesses can do without, at least for a while.

Oh but at least your a feeble minded sheep and “think” like the mainstream tells you you should. 🐑🐑🐑🤡🤡🤡thanks for making my pointThat may or may not account for a few thousandTechnically, states had the option to extend the unemployment benefits for a further 13 weeks, but a good amount haven't.So is this 26 weeks for lifetime? Or just for one period of unemployment like say, i face unemployment 2 times over 5 years do I collectively get 26 weeks or do I actually get 52 - 26 per period.Just wow. I don't even get the logic here. If you have been unemployed long enough, the government essentially just discards you to the streets?Sounds like a Trump quote to meI can't vouch for the site, but some google searching found this: https://www.cbpp.org/research/economy/policy-basics-how-many-weeks-of-unemployment-compensation-are-available

Looks like the extra 13 weeks applies a lot of places.The end of July is the current end date of PUA.  Some hypothetical lazy bastard can file after the deadline for unemployed weeks that occurred before July 31st and get a retroactive benefit for the weeks that occurred before July 31 but thats it.  Congress would have to pass a new bill and trump would have to sign it for any additional money.Hopefully by Jan 1 that gives the government enough time to set up massive tent cities and stock up on MREs.He is in the sound business, but his business is not sound.  How’s that?Did you checked? How do you know his lad is swelled?No one would say "swell lad".I feel you. The sentiments are shared client and vendor-side. I’m not convinced the trend will continue - there’s so much screen fatigue, and I think event directors will soon be under pressure to prove that virtual events are a worthwhile investment.

But it’s hard... when I’m working a live event the energy is entirely different. You pull all nighters, you make sure your tech rehearsals are flawless. You plan for redundancy, etc. With virtual, it’s just another screen.We STILL do not have a national mask mandate or any other coordinated response to stop the virus (as every other civilized nation has done). This falls squarely on the denier-in-chief and his continued anti-science stance.


But nice deflection attempt.> Yeah I'd be really surprised if we don't get more stimulus soon

Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell stated no for stimulus packages (as of a few days ago).Don't impose on my freedom to kill you with a virus you selfish bastard.> Just keep printing money, what's the worst that could happen?

A fellow fan of MMT I see.

(Also /s)Speaking only for myself: The stock market should be allowed to move freely up **and** down. Even if down means WAY down. 

The whole point is that investors (usually the rich in a society) are taking on extra risk (vs a bond) in exchange for extra (potential) reward. 

If that system can be bailed out by borrowing, which essentially sends it on to the working class, then the whole system is broken. The rich get all the potential reward with much less of the risk, and the working class just gets fucked.That is good news! The articles I was reading a couple days ago seemed like there was a big gridlock on the issue.Oh thanks for correcting me! That’s also insane. Although, I guess that’s less of an indicator of something bad going on and possibly just science taking place and we update shit as we learn about it.[removed]I am getting unemployment, and I did end the job myself. I told them that I would like to continue working from home in another state. They declined and I ended my employment in mid June. I can prove it if you want a DM I'll show the unemployment deposit from this week.How? Was this pre Covid? Also didn’t you know you could just quit the military! Husband is in and hates itAnd weirdly enough, this is the moment conversations such as this suddenly come to an end

How strangeOur state is not requiring proof of seeking work. They just ask have you denied a job offer.

It is also not a good idea to overestimate the willingness of employers to tell the UI office on people. Restaurant industry is shady as is, I do not see them turning people in, especially when the governor said do not go to work if you are afraid to do so.What are you saying I said isn’t true?  I didn’t even mention the CARES Act.No idea my man. I’ve never applied for unemployment, but from what I recall my friend telling me is that he would just list random employers even though he may not have actually applied; again, from what I recall HIM telling me. I’ve never applied for unemployment and I’m sure the process is different for each state>That's great, but Washington state has less than 400,000 currently unemployed. Florida has 1.4 million unemployed and benefits are

>capped  
>  
> at $275 a week for 12 weeks.

I love how you pivoted there.  First your argument was that you must actively seek employment else not collect the benefits.  That is not a correct statement.  To use your wording what you said was "patently untrue."

Now your argument is that since Washington state has fewer unemployed people than another state it somehow doesn't count.

You deserve a gold medal for mental gymnastics today!> I've been on unemployment before,

Have you been on it during a global pandemic? When unemployment levels are at their highest in recent history? Do you *really* think that they have the resources and manpower to verify that tens of millions of people are applying for jobs, and moreover, applying for jobs they actually qualify for, putting real effort into their resume, etc.
>I've been on unemployment before, so I know first hand how it works. If you want to go by anecdotal experience, the majority of people I know who applied for unemployment benefits still haven't received them in many states, even after two months of applying and being approved.
  
  
Because this isn't normal. There's barely enough people working to hand out benefits to the people you know...but There's enough people to make sure others are searching for work? No.Reading comprehension. Try using. Thanks.CITI..Amazon has hired more than 50,000 people here in India in the last few months and more there are more than 20,000 openings right now at Amazon India.The new paradigm is that printing money itself creates goods and services.

If I knew the answer to that question and how to use it, I'd be a rich bear.Simple-minded bitchWhat in the braindead? In the 1st response I said I bought a house hahahha.

I'm not a doctor, but I think they check that by an angiogram.That's just swell, lad.I believe you are moving the goalposts here, and it is you who is deflecting. We were discussing people out of a job who are struggling to make ends meet.. not the pandemic. I agree the two are related, but other countries with national mask mandates also have industries that were destroyed. However, their versions of congress passed laws that supported the individuals who were effected instead of big companies--look at france and its UBIAs of this morning they're debating a short-term extension of the enhanced benefits because they can't find consensus among republicans. Mitch wants UE to be 70% of a pay check, Mnuchin wants 100%He can disagree with it until he's blue in the face, but he's going to lose to what the vast majority of even GOPs think (although they don't agree with the 3 trillion that's been proposed by the House, they do agree with some form of 1 more stimulus).

Even if they don't look good on getting one done before the month ends, if we were to see the market truly slide, Trump's going to nudge people into changing their minds shortly after that.I mean, the stock market is allowed to move freely. The entire premise that it isn't is a reddit meme devoid of any actual evidence. The reality is that reddit simply doesn't like it when the markets move in the directions it didn't predict.It’s actually just a bigger hit against the WHO.  If the CDC was trying to influence people to not wear masks to protect the US mask supply...the WHO was downplaying the coronavirus to not make China look bad.  They praised China’s response and parroted the Chinese misinformation....actually sometimes releasing “new information” about the virus that was actually just sent to them by the Chinese government.  

I honestly don’t expect much from our politicians when things like this happen.  It’s a big ugly mess even at the best of times.  However, the real danger is the fact that our scientific community isn’t up in arms about how these global scientific leaders have lied and manipulated while playing politics.  Our scientific leaders should never get away with withholding facts or obscuring truth.  If they start down that path, how do we trust our scientists any more than we trust our politicians...and that is a really really scary thought.  Its crazy to me that this all happened so recently and we have already forgotten that the scientific community that we trusted actually were major players in this going badly and not some benevolent source of hope that would have saved us if we had just listened to them.[removed]I would be careful if I was you. All claims are getting automatically approved right now. When they start doing audits, they might ask for the money back because typically you will not receive unemployment if you quit. Unless your previous employer just didn’t care and approved the claim.Actually right during Covid. I was an officer and I had completed my initial obligation, so I was free to request a release from active duty at any time. If you’d husband is enlisted he’ll have to wait until the end of his contractYeah it really pisses me off people can so calmly make shit up and just say it as if its true without sourcing it.Employers pay your unemployment through taxes, so it absolutely benefits them to report cases of people turning down work, especially those who have been asked to come back to work.You're right, it's not that you're wrong, but that not all states are waiving that requirement. Sorry for wording my response incorrectly.I’m sure the agency could follow up and check if he did apply but so many people are on unemployment they can’t audit everyone.  I am thinking that you could hands down apply to jobs you know you won’t get just to keep collecting unemployment.  I personally have no issues with people taking advantage of the system right now anyway.  It’s better that people stay home.I pivoted yet you mentioned the situation in one state while ignoring the other 49? If one of us is doing mental gymnastics, it's you.During a pandemic no, but I lost my job in finance in the 2008 crash so while not exactly the same, it's the most similar event in many of our lifetimes.

As far as manpower yes, and it is for a similar reason the IRS audits lower income people more than they do the rich. The states do not want to continue to pay benefits. Full stop. Most states don't even offer a "reasonable" level of unemployment assistance regardless of the salary you were making before you became unemployed.

These systems, especially in certain places, are designed to frustrate you enough to give up on the benefits because the struggle and anger and anxiety you have to go through to get them is mind boggling. A system like Florida's is a perfect example. They spend more time monitoring people who are on assistance than they do processing new claims for a reason.The systems are working as intended. Many unemployment systems are intentionally designed to frustrate people away from using them, and the systems use more resources to kick people out of the system than they do processing new applicants into the system.Yes i have seen it.  Whether it is accurate or sustainable, though........Only thing I will warn of is be careful of the Company. I know some people in my network who took the same route and work more then they did in public accounting.I got 20+ years to retirement Im more of a very fuzzy bull. Looking 10+ years yeah Im bullish. Next 1-2 years very not. That and paper hands is killing me. Buy Amazon call, set sell order at 100% because easy math. Realize if it goes to 160% I make all my trading losses back and start eating into my long term loss on Ford. Move limit order. Next day position jumps from 30% gain to 102% Day 3 falls to 40%. I cash out and it keeps going lower. Had I left the original limit Id have added $11,000 to my account. 

Buys 2 shares of TSLA on 6/23 chickens out sells an hour later for a small loss. A week later buys 45 shares of TSLA 20% higher. Chickens the fuck out again. Buys a TSLA 1800C for October $6900  Gaps down. Sells at $5700 a 20% loss. 

Basically if I'd left well enough alone the first time. 

Amazon Call: +11k. 2 Tesla Shares: +50% ($1000 profit.) Tesla call cost: 6900 sell for up to $12,500. Likely would have cashed out before earnings. 

The TSLA 2 TSLA shares I bought around $1007. The 45 shares I bought around $1212. The 2 shares would have only added about $1200 to my investments at 1600/share but that's a 60% gain

The 45 shares would have earned me about 40%. But that would have been like 28k and if my numbers are right plenty to make up for losses. 

I didn't have the money to make all the moves at the same time. I could do the block of Tesla shares or the Options contracts on Amazon and Tesla but not all three. The Amazon sell order at 100% would have made me about $16400 I made $5000

Tesla shares at 1212 sold at 1455 would have made me about 10k. 

The 2 options plays would have made me about 15k total. Instead of about $5000 total.

Workhorse cost me a lot. If all had gone well. I'd have made about 27k and not lost about $15k so my accounts would have been in much better shape. Sadly the unrealized gains hurt emotionally. The realized losses hurt walletly.Lol sick burn “jump of a chair”those show up as excess deaths by another cause a few weeks down the line.

It's that excess death data that made Fauci say USA is probably severely underestimating deaths from this (including deaths caused indirectly like postponed surgery or undiagnosed/untreated illness)It really is true.. One of my coworkers who was laid off with me and collecting unemployment ended up passing away last month. He’s one of the ones no longer continuing their claim but it’s because he’s not alive anymore, not because he found a job 😢This guy soundsHis sound business isn’t.pic it or it didn't happenedA reduction over time would probably be best. 70% for August and September, then maybe 25% for October-December.

If nothing happens, it's going to be brutal next month.[removed]Ahh okay I was thinking you quit mid contract lol. Yep we’re waiting for that day... 2.5 more years!The federal relief isn't included in state UI taxes. It might benefit them to report people but that doesn't mean they will by any means.“Finesse or get finessed”. I don’t have a problem with people taking advantage of it either. I just don’t understand how some people think that people aren’t. 

How do people/the wealthy build wealth? By taking advantage of opportunities when they’re offered. A lot of PPP went to companies that didn’t really need it but if they’re eligible why not apply? Anyone and their mother could’ve applied and got a PPP loan; wether you went through the right bank is a different story. Banks want to give PPP loans: Guaranteed by SBA and get fees for originating them. Banks don’t have shit to lose on PPP.>I pivoted yet you mentioned the situation in one state while ignoring the other 49? If one of us is doing mental gymnastics, it's you.

You made an assertion.  I proved it wrong by providing an example.  I don't need to prove it wrong 50 times over for my point to be valid.Auditing people’s taxes is relatively easy and can be somewhat automated, versus monitoring people to make sure they’re actually applying for jobs. And even if they are, it takes real serious manpower to verify that they’re actually putting effort into their applications as opposed to purposefully bungling themI'm sure you have a source for this statement you just pulled out of thin air to help your argument. Just to be safe i won't be holding my breath.That would be unfortunate, hopefully they have really good comp. Appreciate the adviceI've been watching WKHS because they're kinda-local to me. It's been a wild ride with that one.hol upDepends on how long shut downs to continue. If states are still in the middle of shutdowns (i.e. actively don't want people returning to work), people shouldn't be returning to work and the enhanced benefits should continue for rent assistance and demand stimulusYour submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

https://www.wesh.com/article/florida-unemployment-problems-desantis/32771429#Yeah I heard about it from Reddit. My dad's about to retire as a broker/advisor. I talked to him about the pandemic like March 1. He told me just hold on to everything but I wanted a reason to sell a few things like BAC Id held it for like 15 years and was profitable but it hasn't been for so long like 2008-2016. I figured if the economy halts banks are tumbling so sell BAC take profits and in a month consider buying back into it or spending the money elsewhere. Then we went into work from home. 

Work from home gave me less to do my sales and savings left me with money on the sidelines. I tried options and apparently lost a lot over time.

Heard about them on Reddit. Considered dropping a couple grand on options. Got nervous. Bought 3 instead of like 12. That was Monday morning. I sold. Thursday morning for +100%. Turned $1800 into $3400 quick. At that point I was down about $6000. A lot of money but compared to all my investments just a couple percent. 

They'd been going up like crazy for weeks. I figured if I go big like a 15-20% move would get me my 8k back and I'd cash out then start looking for long term stocks to add to my portfolio for the next 25-40 years. They moved 20% down. The hole in my account just went from 8k to 20k plus.

Most of the stocks I sold off have not recovered so Id could buy them back cheaper. Trading hurt me more than just holding would have by a long shotThat didnt sound right?Wait a minuteIt's certainly contingent on a multitude of factors including how badly the state in question is doing.

Best case scenario slowly reducing the benefit would give people a kick in the butt to start looking or go back to existing jobs. Of course that isn't going to happen if there are no jobs to return to.Did you even read your own sources? There's nothing in there that says "they use more resources to kick people off".

I grabbed a few puts for earnings based off the gap and every other stocks response so far to earningsAMD has been consolidating for the last 6 months at the 50-55 range. I wouldn’t be surprised if it consolidates around 65 before the next catalyst or full delivery of their new chip series. Intel’s failure is a massive win for AMD.Man I’m not trying to rain on your parade but the revenue, net income and P/E ratio of AMD vs Intel in comparison to their share prices is so out of whack it’s not even funny. I understand the market looks forward, but how long will it take for AMD to reach the level of income and profitability that Intel has today? 

If I was invested in either of them I would probably consider locking profits on AMD and reinvesting in Intel. This is a huge overreaction on both ends IMHO and AMD is on a huge bubble right now and Intel is vastly oversold.Not trying to rain on your parade but do you understand the implications and bench marks that AMD has presented with 7nm chips? The next line of GPU has a data center solution that consumes less wattage than NVDA’s counter part less energy consumption means less heat. Both are major barriers for data centers which are exploding in utilization. No one offers that efficiency because it’s the first model that breaks past quantum tunneling. Intel is dead in the water (the next IBM) with no competitive advantage at any junction.

Edit: intel not being able to produce their own 7nm chips puts them in a hard spot TSMC is back ordered and might not accommodate intels orders, forcing them to use SIMC who produces 9nm making their next product line as not competitive.Sounds like what people said about TSLA below 1000 and look even after being down more than 10% from ATH, TSLA is still higher than 1000.Once businesses switch to AMD consumers will follow.**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*Yes! $NTSX has 1.5x leverage although it is not all in stocks.

technically some put write/covered call funds have some leverage but in practice they are less risky than just owning the stocks. You can always customize the leverage level by balancing UPRO with SPYPPLC NTSXLeveraged ETFs rarely use options and having a smaller leverage multiple doesn't affect management fees or borrowing costs.Just use futures. You can have however much leverage you want.Yes.  [CEF](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/closed-end-funds/leverage#:~:text=In%20practice%2C%20the%20average%20leveraged,another%20%240.33%20in%20leveraged%20capital.)s.Just buy an etf with 30% borrowed money?Perhaps buy they're certainly not common. It would be much easier to buy on margin a little to create the desired effect. I suppose you could even just buy unleveraged shares and add a few 2x leveraged shares in a ratio that would sort of end up performing like 1.3xNot that I know of.  There are some hybrid funds which do things like rotate in and out of sectors or add volatility as a way to hedge or limit losses.Yep, there's the PP family (PPLC, PPMC, PPSC) and the other thing you can do is vary the proportions of UPRO and SPY to get the desired leverage ratio you want (like 75% SPY 25% UPRO)Why doesn't it?  Surely the lower the leverage the lower the chances of a default on a loan, no?Please don't give advice if you don't know enough about a strategy to highlight the downsides.  There are plenty of disadvantages to futures that may make them a terrible choice for the OP.

1) **They are taxed more heavily**.  40% of your profits are taxed at the short-term capital gains rate.  Do not do this in a taxable account.

2) E-mini contracts are $150k of exposure, so not suitable for small portfolios.

3) They are not hands-off, you need to roll them every few months.this. people are fking morons.Where's the fun in doing something simple and reasonable?There is a 100% expectation that the money will be paid back. You aren't applying for a personal loan at your local commercial bank.Of course I know about the downsides. However, if OP's goal is to mildly leverage the S&P 500, then futures are the best way for a retail investor to do that. I wouldn't recommend that they do that, but that's another topic.Regarding 2, micros are 16k.Don't tell someone else that they "don't know enough" about a topic that they provided one sentence about. You have no idea what he knows. And in your "correction," which was really just you letting us all know that you are mildly literate, you provided wrong information as has already been pointed out to you.How can there be?  What if the S&P 500 drops by 60%, you would default at 2x leverage.  Surely it's more likely to fall at least 30% than at least 50%...You would be margin called well before 60%.> What if the S&P 500 drops by 60%, you would default at 2x leverage.

They match leverage daily not over time, so 60% drop of SPY is not 120% drop on 2x bull etf. They also reverse split when low valued.

Drops 3%, 2x ETF at 94%  
Drops 3%, 2x ETF at 88.36%  
83.0584  
...  
29.01062411314618% left on a 2x ETF when SPY is at 40% of original value, assuming 3% increments. Will obviously vary depending on up days or bigger down days.**Hi, welcome to /r/investing. Please note that as a topic focused subreddit we have higher posting standards than much of Reddit:**

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*Hertz is bankrupt. Its creditors own the company now. It may continue to operate as a company, but if it does, the current stock will be zeroed and creditors will receive the new stock.you sir seem like a man of cultureIt might make a comeback but a comeback that doesn't include current shareholders. Unless something has changed (I don't follow it), it went bankrupt - shareholders in bankruptcy generally lose everything or in rare cases if it comes out of bankruptcy, common shares get cancelled and previous shareholders get a small % of their prior holdings in new shares.

Also, there's so many great companies out there I don't know why something that was never a great performer and went bankrupt is that compelling.> Is it silly to think that a company that large wouldn't at least make some sort of come back?

From a consumer perspective, no, it's not silly to think that someone will swoop in and buy the Hertz assets and keep the company operating, they have a known brand, locations and customer base. Makes sense.

From an investing perspective it IS silly to think that a company going anywhere near bankruptcy would be able to use money efficiently (generating a return on your investment). Companies working through bankruptcy aren't focused on growth, they are focused on survival. That's one of the reasons you don't try to catch a falling knife. The upside is limited.Imagine owning a car that the bank repossess because you aren't making payments.

Hertz is your car and right now you're not making payments to the bank.

Will someone drive the car again?  Yes.  It just won't be you, unless you pay up what the bank is owed.Hertz probably won't make a comeback. They went bankrupt.You get a noodleSo first thing to remember: a big company doesn’t mean a healthy company. Think Enron, GE, Sears, Macy’s, etc. 

The least you should do is spend time to learn how to read a company’s financial statements and understand what they mean. 

Hertz became big not because it was doing exceptionally well. It got big because it kept borrowing money to grow. Loans can offer capital injection, but they do have to be paid back, with interest. If a company borrows too much too fast, and its profitability continues to fall behind, then guess what happens?

Hertz could make a comeback, sure, perhaps under a different incarnation. But the outlook does not look promising given the circumstances.[deleted]As a newb investor I would recommend to avoid at all costs. It is not a wise investment. Your money is far better in another business :)Haha thats how i was when i bought $245 worth of stocks on frontier communications. After a year i sold it for 10.85. You live and you learn. But i should have listened to people of r/investing and learn it the easier way.It's silly to think Hertz will make a comeback. They are bankrupt, and no one is driving any where any time soon, and certainly not renting cars. Use your brain.

Your post uses too many double negatives for me to understand what exactly you're asking.So any stock I have now is just worthless?Lol I can't tell if this is sarcasm or what😄Thanks for the info. I get it now. I just invested in things that took a dive and I thought would come back strong after this whole thing was over. So far I'm still up a bit but, took a hit with the hertz thing after they went bankrupt because I didn't understand what it really meant.I see. Thanks for the input! Guess I'll just ride this dead horse into the sunset.>probably

The probability of them coming back is 0.00001% at most.My first award for being a moron. Thanks, homie!Prolifically put, my dude.Well yeah, I know that now. Think I bought in before all the hype and before they went bankrupt.You are wrong. Everyone is driving. 

Flying has taken the bigger hit. Who wants to fly in a cramped cabin with 200 strangers when you can jump in a car and escape to a nice place for a weekend with people you know? Stop making assumptions and do a Google search and you'll see plenty of cities and states that have seen camp site reservations go through the roof. I rented a 3 row SUV for 2 weekends in a row and the waiting lines were long both on pick up and drop off.Honestly, I thought I was using my brain and wasn't thinking short term. I don't really care if it happens tomorrow or next year I just figured it would happen eventually once things got moving again.It will be. It currently has a relatively high market value of $1.60 per share which I think you should take advantage of.It's sarcasm. Hertz is a meme stock that showcases how average Robinhood investors don't understand how bankruptcy works and don't do due diligenceWhy?  You can get out now and save your money.  They're still trading this version of the stock, but you're sitting on a ticking time bomb.  Hertz bonds traded at 26 cents on the dollar at auction, meaning the likelihood of your shares going to 0 is nearly 100%.   Your upside is limited and your downside is your entire investment.There's more opportunity for returns investing in companies that are doing well than there is trying to rescue failing ones.This was my thought. I just started buying a little bit of stock in things I thought would make a good come-back. Avis and hertz (rental cars) was on my list of things I thought would bounce back. Avis is doing well. Hertz is not (clearly).People are driving their own cars to those camp sites, not rentals.

Fine don’t listen to me - put all your money in Hertz. I hope you lose all your money.[removed]So anything bought after their bankruptcy are the "new" shares? Which could potentially hold value in the future?Gotcha. I actually bought in before all of that. I watched it sky rocket and was like, hell yeah! However, I didn't get out. Guess you gotta learn somehow. Always been the hard way for me.I sold it. At least my Avis stock is doing well (for now).Shouldn't we all be shorting it then?welllllll the entire value investing thesis would disagree with that to be honest.

Hertz is neither successful or a value stock, it's not a functioning company.You should drop your /investing subscription while you're ahead. All of your assumptions are proven wrong within a 5 second Google search and your simpleton level of advice will fall on deaf ears because most people here know better than to take advice from a toxic Redditor who can't back up their posts.

ThanksWould anyone be interested in a dropbox that I've been building over the past few years that has modeling courses (WSP, BIWS), industry models, academic & hedge fund letters, and more?I had a thought recently that I haven't been able to substantiate, so I'm wondering if anyone else has looked into it.

With the accounting rules change in 2018 stating companies need to report the unrealised gains of their stock portfolio as profit, what proportion of earnings of a major index (say S&P 500) are just due to the stock price gains of other companies in that index?

If these earnings make up anything like a significant portion of all earnings, this accounting principle feels like it could lead to higher asset prices during bull markets and in particular in bubbles, but lead just as quickly to a downward spiral if the market cools off.Had a meeting with a manager today and he was firm on his stance on how “useless” ROE has become in the midst of share buybacks. Can someone explain why he would think why ROE is not a valuable metric in today’s day and age?is there any way to get ahold of Joel Greenblatt's lectures + materials from his valuation course taught at Columbia over the years? there are a couple of lectures floating around on youtube as well as a transcript/summary PDF but unfortunately, the quality isn't very high and a lot of sentences don't make sense.

I am thinking of reaching out to a few funds. I want to change up my career. I have good, relevant experience and would take a base pay cut.

Will keep you guys updated regardless. Kicking things off with this postNewb  question. What is the reason why you would NOT see insiders buying when the stock goes down a lot? Example, I learned about Mastercraft Boats (MCFT) via an [investment fund's](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e03bb9dcc191357f10902ad/t/5e3162b1d56e0e36eb0e4d2a/1580294834276/Q2%2719+letter.pdf) quarterly who has held a large position for the last 1-2+ years, so I put it on my watchlist. Recently, I see Prem Watsa nibbling at it in the [$13-$15 range](https://www.dataroma.com/m/hist/hist.php?f=FFH&s=MCFT) where the stock traded throughout Q3 and Q4 2019. The stock then drops to $5.50-7 this past March (Watsa buys more as well), but I don't see [insiders buying](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/MCFT/insider-trades/). So, why not? Don't Mastercraft CEO + employees know how good of a value their company's stock is? Why wouldn't they buy during such a big dip?I was reading about the oil price war and how the banks might be exposed to it, the commentator suggesting that people should work out how much exposure banks have to the falling oil industry stock prices. I wondered if anyone would be able to suggest how I go about doing this?

Thanks in advance.How do Value Investors remain economy agnostic? You always here great value investors like Buffett talk about how they don't worry about what the economy or going but they only care about buying businesses at the right price. Well, now that I'm trying to actually value companies, I'm finding this hard to put into practice. For example, with the corona virus and oil prices, there's some crazy things going on in the economy. But I can't ignore what's going on when I'm forecasting sales growth and margin expansion/contractions for my valuations.

All news sources say that they were involved in a fraudulent way with the value added resellers and that 'Autonomy retained risks, rewards and ownership of the goods' – not the resellers. And that Autonomy was 'still exercising continuing involvement to an abnormal degree' hence violating IFRS guidelines.

But I went through the annual report of 2010 and the language is plain and simple? They recognise revenues at deliveries to these resellers.  

My question is that in this particular case how does a normal shareholder investor prove these facts through reading the annual report (if at all?) . Is there no hope to identify fraud even if you can read reports brilliantly?

The following were additionally unraveled by the SEC:

 1. The resellers did not even download the software; and

2. They were involved in round-trip transactions with them and  'purchased unwanted, unused, or overpriced products from the resellers' to show the saleIs there a best method or flow for security analysis on tech companies from the perspective of the tech itself? 


Ie google comes out with new encryption algorithm how can I do analysis on the encryption. algorithms perceived market value and how that would affect stock pricesIirc buffett gave an example of purchasing a company for $500b and if you want a 10% return then you would have to get $50b, easy. 

Wouldnt it be more proper to subtract tangible book value first from the figure since you are actually purchasing the excess i.e. goodwill? Say for extreme example, a company has $500b in cash, no debt and for some reason its selling for $500b and it generates $50b. Obviously this is kinda illogical, but the question is regarding the premise.Does EBITDA and CFO makes any sense when analysing a consolidated financial statements despite both doesn't start from Net Income Attributable to Shareholders? especially when there's large income from non controlling interest.I was thinking that insurance companies might get hit hard by unexpected policy payouts greater in number/frequency than actuary models predict which will eat into to there profitability and profitability of future underwriting (I.e. more conservative reinvestment of premiums).  Especially since the mortalities associated with this virus are very skewed towards 80+, the policy payout burden maybe much greater. 

Does anyone with actuary/insurance know-how understand how this could play out?Does anyone else find it interesting that all the major exchange stocks were hit hard this past week? On a short-term basis, I would imagine the revenues from transactional volume are significantly higher (2x or more yoy) and it doesn't seem like we are in a financial crisis right with major US financial institutions failing like 2008.Good day, Everyone.

I wonder what to do with "Excess tax benefits from employee stock plans" ?

Example:

Cashflow statement have these items in cash from operations

    Expense related to stock-based awards                      77,366
    Excess tax benefits from employee stock plans              (54,597)

Should i add the net of 22,769 (cause tax benefits reduced expenses a bit) or should i add full  77,366 ?Does anyone have any experience analysing bonds? Can you recommend a high quality data source for bond analysis similar to capitaliq? Additionally, where can I read research reports on bonds? I come from an equity background so I'm used to equity brokerage reports etc.  


Secondly, having read a bond prospectus indenture on a secured offering, they provide a list of property names as security but no valuation. Yet S&P rate the bond as 90% likely recovery in case of default. Do they have to list the book/ market value of the security somehwere? How will S&P derive the value? Can I trust S&P recovery ratings?

High operating leverage (and fixed costs) might be just as bad as financial leverage if you don't have huge margins to absorb down years. Asset heavy commodity companies are a good example of this. 

Greenblatt always cites the computer conference company he invested in as his biggest mistake, and where he learned about operating leverage. 

What has Buffett written or said about this in the past?EV/UFCF vs P/LFCF.

When reading theses/opinions of follow equity investors on these or that stock I got impression that EV/UFCF is more favored comp over P/LFCF, but why is that?

Don’t equity investors should care more about P/LFCF?

Here is one thought example showing why I think P/LFCF is better metric:

Say we have 2 companies with same EV/UFCF.

Basically

(Cap1 + Debt1)/(FCFE1 + int1(1-tax1) – netBorrowings1) = (Cap2 + Debt2)/(FCFE2 + int2(1-tax2) – netBorrowings2)

Also lets assume that in current year companies did not borrow more or repay current debt, so

(Cap1 + Debt1)/(FCFE1 + int1(1-tax1) = (Cap2 + Debt2)/(FCFE2 + int2(1-tax2)

Company 1 has much more Debt than Company 2, but both companies have same int(1-tax) - say it’s cause Company 1 were able to borrow at much better rate (say CEO was proactive and borrowed at good times instead of waiting for times when they will need the money, or industry 1 allows for lower rates cause it’s borrowed over hard assets, etc)

Clearly Company 1 is better target for equity investors and it’s shown in P/LFCF, but EV/UFCF is same for Company 2 and Company 1.I am researching a company from canada and its listed on the new york stock exchange. The company lists its reports in canadian dollars

1) is the market cap listed on yahoo finance in $CAD or USD
2) other sources have varying listings of the market cap, bamsec has is as 3.2b and yahoo has it listed as 3.02Hi guys,

I've been studying Wix for a while and although I like the business, I'm somewhat uncomfortable with the management team (even after hearing goods things about them). They seem to **cherry-pick the numbers** that they present to investors and analysts. I'm not talking about chicanery or fraud or anything like that, but even so, it makes me uncomfortable. I just would like to know if what these guys are doing is normal in the SaaS world?

Take for instance the CAC: They will use the **direct marketing costs** in acquiring a subscriber, not the **total figure for Sales & Marketing**. Should we use their number or should we use the total figure for Sales & Marketing?

They also brag about being **FCF positive**. If we take out the Share Base Compensation (as we should, given that this is a very real cost), they are **barely FCF positive**.

They have their own metric to measure if the Marketing spend has been effective. It's called the TROI (Time-Return-on-Investment) and their goal is to keep it under 9 months. They are very vocal about this. But then they'll miss these 9 months and - although they don't hide it - they don't step up and say clearly that they've missed it.

I was wondering what other fellow investors think about this. Have you encountered similar cases? Is this FCF and CAC thing just a WIX thing or i**s it happening across the other SaaS businesses** out there?

Thank you for your help guys.Hey,

I'm an amateur at this, but I was looking at BKNG, and I'm quite bewildered by how different their data is from different sources, some of which should be official. The differences are MASSIVE, and lead to completely different current (and probably other) ratios, and I'd appreciate it if someone could enlighten me if I'm being an idiot.

I'll be looking at annual data ending 12/31/2019

**The NASDAQ site** ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bkng/financials](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bkng/financials)) cites, in K:

Total current assets: $8,249,000

Total current liabilities: $20,204,000

Giving an (AFAIK) pretty shitty current ratio of 0.41

**The official SEC 10K filing fom** ([https://ir.bookingholdings.com/node/24796/html](https://ir.bookingholdings.com/node/24796/html)) cites, in millions:

Total current assets: 9,833

Total current liabilities: 5,366

Giving a decent 1.81 current ratio

**Yahoo! finance** also gives different numbers, but more similar to NASDAQ.

I wanted to look up other peoples' analysis, and came upon some:

**Another site** ([https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nasdaq-bkng/booking-holdings/news/how-financially-strong-is-booking-holdings-inc-nasdaqbkng/](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nasdaq-bkng/booking-holdings/news/how-financially-strong-is-booking-holdings-inc-nasdaqbkng/)) cites again completely different numbers:

Total current assets: 5.4B

Total current liabilities: 2.86B

Giving a similar 1.89 current ratio.

Further searching returns more dissimilar results.

What do I do? 0.4 and 1.8 are MASSIVELY different numbers for the current ratio, as are 5.4B and \~10B (current assets).How does everyone here that have a more value driven approach focus just on value-based trades and not macro bets like shorting/buying puts on the S&P or Nasdaq etc in volatile times like this? 

This is more of a behavioural question since I buy more into the concept of circle of competence / buy and hold and the value investing philosophy but sometimes I get tempted because a colleague of mine seems to be making good money making more macro bets. 

Would love to get your thoughts on this, thank you!Do you add R&D back into operating profit, do you leave it out...what do you do with it because it's a cash outlay that the company has to do for future growth but what do you do with it in terms of valuation because I'm so lost.What do you think about valuing a commercial bank stock by Residual Income Method? isn't most appropriate method for bank stocks since it's based on book value and bank's book value is most reliable?Could someone explain these 2 examples on Liquidation Preference ?

>For example, assume a venture capital company invests $1 million in a startup in exchange for 50% of the common stock and $500,000 of preferred stock with liquidation preference. Assume also that the founders of the company invest $500,000 for the other 50% of the common stock. If the company is then sold for $3 million, the venture capital investors receive $2 million, being their preferred $1M and 50% of the remainder, while the founders receive $1 million.  
>  
>Conversely, if the company sells for $1 million, the venture capital firm receives $1 million and the founders receive nothing.

I think i understand the first example. It was $500,000 of preferred stock with liquidation preference, and company was sold for twice of initial investment (initially it was $500K in preferred stock and $1mil in common stock), so $500,000 x 2 = $1mil of preferred.

But why in the second example $500,000 of preferred stock with liquidation preference was turned into $1 million ?I see 2 formulas on FCF:

    FCF = EBIT*(1-t)+D&A +/- WC changes - CapEx

and

    FCF = Cash from Operations – CapEx

Are they the same? If yes, why use the first one if second is much easier to use?

(go to cash flow statement and take "Net cash provided by operating activities" instead of calculating "EBIT\*(1-t)+D&A +/- WC changes")What happens to all the proposed M&A deals? I doubt most can still be executed or is it contractual obligation?Can someone please explain to me how companies like HD, MCD, and SBUX had negative equity at the end of last year?  And why are they not bankrupt?  And since they clearly can generate profit, why is there no equity? I just want to understand this because clearly there will be other companies in the same situation very soon.Hi guys,

I was wondering how financial managers decide about the leverage of a firm in practice or to be more specific: How is the optimal D/E ratio is determined in practice?

thanks in advanceDo any professionals or semi professionals want to brainstorm? I have put together a watch list of about 100 names. I am semi professional in that I professionally analyze industry risk and credit valuations Hello, do you know good book about CEO compensation,insider ownership,CEO motivation etc to better analyse proxy?How is venture capital going to do over the upcoming years?Every formula I've seen for ROIC uses EBIT or NOPAT as the numerator. If FCF is supposed to represent the cash leftover to reinvest back in the company, then why is it not used as the numerator? If it's not the best metric for measuring funds available for reinvestment, then why is there so much focus on it?Why does ROE regarded as investor's return? let's say there's a company earns $200 per share with $1,000 of book value per share. that is ROE of 20%. then let's assume their earnings is constant for next 10 years. it'll look like $200/$3000 at 10 years later. ending ROE is 6.66% thus their average ROE for past 10 years would be around 13%. does investor earns 13% yield per year by holding this company? it seems not since earnings is constant. there's nothing to move the stock price if you assume there's no change of multiple either.

So again, why does ROE regarded as investor's return?Ok so the stimulus package gives relief to mortgages iirc. So far, my friends who own a good amount of rental properties are telling me that one of their banks (this varies from bank to bank) is telling them that mortgage payments will be delayed for 3 months, interest accrues and at the end of 3 months the delayed payments are due all at once.

So how does this exactly help? The landlord in this case is just going to have try to get a big lump payment from his tenants, which would probably be impossible if they cant pay monthly now. 

My main point that im trying to figure out is who is suppose to be giving the olive branch from the stimulus funding. Im assuming banks securitize the residential/commercial loans and then sell it off as a MBS so really its the holders of the MBS who have to take the first step in freezing payments? Is this even possible? Basically, where would the first step in freezing payments come from in order for the landlord to pass on the benefit to the tenant?I just started looking @ US companies (been covering emerging markets for the past 6 years), and noticed that even some good companies are extremely levered with their D:E (debt to equity) ratio. It's as if the companies are being handled like it will never face face any events that will remotely hurt them in anyway. 

I just want to understand whether this is:

1. A US culture kind of thing due to stiff competition? 
2. Or just overly ambitious CEO that just wants to push share price to the limits in the short term without overall long term view?
3. Or is it just my statistical bias that I happen to find a lot of highly levered companies? While there are still many prudently managed cash rich solvent companies in the market with smaller cap (in comparison to the billion dollars caps comps)?

I am not here to flame, just genuinely curious because from where I come from, no matter how shitty the company is, the D:E hardly goes over 3, or more.Not sure if im reading this right, but did BRK just issue a $1b note due 2025 at 0% interest?

Has anyone worked on fair value estimates for any of these companies and is open to discussing it with someone who wants to learn the art from a professional?

I understand its the owners earnings that can be taken out of the business throughout its life discounted at the proper discount rate. But want to learn how different professionals are doing it so I can understand it better.

Thanks in advance !In what order should I read Michael Mauboussin's papers?Don't really know how to ask this question, but I'll try. It's about the economy and QE.

The problem for me, I think, is that an economy is inherently circular / cyclical. So there's really no starting point I can use to build my knowledge, it's confusing to see how it all works and what the implications are. How everything fits together.

Due to COVID-19, the Federal Government has been implementing a number of measures to save the economy, namely printing and injecting enormous amounts of cash. I get the general idea: people having more cash will stimulate the economy. Stimulus checks will alsp help people pay this months rent. 

But from a high level, it makes no sense to me. What even is money? The whole purpose of money is to facilitate exchanges, and there is no inherent value in cash/money itself. They are just pieces of paper. 

So even if the Fed prints all of this money, how does that actually help the situation? Obviously, I immediately see that it would help a family pay this months rent. But fundamentally, there was literally nothing done. COVID is still here, and the actual problem remains exactly the same. All we've done was print some paper. I just can't reconcile  the cause/effects.

To make a simple example, let's say there is person A and person B on an island. They produce their own food. Person A owes person B rent, but both can't produce food due to the virus. All of the sudden, there magically appears pieces of paper (money) for person A to pay person B, so the rent problem is solved. So? They'll both die because they can't make food anymore. That's exactly how I see it, but the economy is way more complex than that obviously, and I really wish I could understand it.Guys, I wanted to launch a discussion on private equity and have your opinion on the industry. I am still at uni, but I am quite suspicious of the industry - everyone at my uni wants to work in this field. Although I enjoy investing, I have the impression that far more people are involved in this industry than there are actually 'capable' people of running businesses.

Do you think it offers better training than investment banking? Do you think PE will become increasingly liquid to a point it is similar to public markets?Hey guys,

How do you assess FIGs?

I'm fairly new to investing and I've looked into a couple of companies "intensively" (relative word) lately. 

My main concerns are Solvency, Liquidity, Cash Flow, Net Return on Debt (average for the past 8-10 years), and then Profitability (I look more for margin and Net Return on costs).

I mean I can google how to examine/assess FIGs on my own, but it's also nice to get a take on what people think. I enjoy learning from others in real time as much as I do from articles, lectures, videos, etc. I was just wondering what you guys measure and how you do since FIGs are a totally different animal than most companies. I'm also curious as to how you'd calculate your margin of safety for them.

Thanks Guys!New to reddit. 1st post so I apologize in advance if I do not get this in the right place. 

I want to know what people think about finding value in the market. I feel like there is a lot of opportunity in the OTC markets that often trade at a discount (IMO), but there is not much discussion or action in those markets. But SP500 stocks will trade many multiples of their intrinsic value. It seems like people don't truly care about disciplined value investing. Just curious how others feel about this.Hey reddit, what would be a good company to try a valuation on for the first time? Would it be better to try it on a very simple company with straight forward operations or would I be doing myself a disservice by not learning how to account for more complex issues like multinational operations/subsidiaries/currency issues that more complicated companies have? Any specific names on a good practice company to value and why would be appreciated. ThanksIn Competition Demystified, Greenwald discusses the price war between Coke and Pepsi. He includes a map of the soft drink industry, which is as follows: raw materials -> soda companies -> bottlers/distributors -> retail outlets. Since Coke and Pepsi technically sell to the bottlers/distributors (assuming they don't own them), did they start a price war by selling the concentrate/syrup product at a lower price to these bottlers/distributors? If that's the case, wouldn't the end consumer not necessarily end up with a lower price (because the bottlers/distributors don't have to lower prices too and could just pocket the extra profit)? Any insight would be really appreciated :)According to the economist, shenanigans are coming, Company are going to cook the books the third quarter, what are the best sources to understand the figures if creative accounting should arise?

Any primers/blogs/S-1/annual reports references are welcome. Thanks !The formula i most often see for FCFE is

>FCFE= CFO - capex

however sometimes i see

>FCFE = CFO + net borrowing – capex

to be exact it looks like

>FCFE = CFO + net borrowing – FCinv

why "net borrowing" part if most of the time excluded ?

I assumed that FCFE and FCFF differ in after tax interest

>int(1-tax rate)

basically

>FCFF= CFO + int(1-tax rate) – capex

but if second formula is correct than they differ in after tax interest and net borrowingHas anyone looked at Lakeland Industries here? I think I may have found a short idea but I have zero clue how to write a proper short thesis so I'll somewhat post it here.

&#x200B;

\-Company makes industrial protective clothing made primarily for industries dealing with environmental hazards and chemicals. They make protective suits, reusable and disposable, PPE for utility work, oil and petrochem, government agencies at federal and state and local levels, pharmaceutical, auto, smelting, steel, glass, etc. Industries that operate in dangerous environments.

\-They own their six manufacturing plants so they can scale up to meet various rush orders and emergencies and this gives them a distinct advantage since typically rush orders through a subcontractor require thirty days notice (p.1 2020 10-k).

\-They list pricing info for their high end chemical protective suit line (p.8), durable woven garments (p.9), but no pricing info mentioned for their disposable protective clothing unit or their high visibility units (they mention this unit in particular isn't very price sensitive).

\-Raw materials are sourced from most of the countries where their manufacturing facilities are in (p.10, most of their facilities are overseas in China and India and Mexico to lower labor costs, and lowers shipping costs for raw materials since they can source near their suppliers). Sources from 30 major mills.

\-Material weakness identified in internal financial controls (p.15) with regards to inventory valuation. This is not their first run in with material weaknesses being identified in their internal controls.

\-Friedman LLP is their auditor, company headquarters moved from Ronkonkoma, NY (they moved around twice while up there), to Decatur, AL in 2020. Friedman has been their auditor since 2016, but before them they hired Mazars which they had disagreements with in section 9a of their FY2017 10k on p.70 with regards to their revenue recognition and inventory valuation policies and various other headaches happening with their operations in China and Brazil. Prior to that they were hiring Warren Averett for their audits but were running into issues with them in regards to accounting for China, Brazil, and were having constant material weaknesses with regards to proper inventory valuation and revenue recognition.

\-Their Weifang operations in China have changed from a manufacturing company to a trading company (p.58). No clue really why but I feel like I should know this.

Their revenue practices are just all over the place. In 2019 and 2020's 10Ks, on pages 42 and 44, respectively, their list how they calculate revenue, as quantity times price per unit. In their 2019 10k on page 49 they say nothing about their method for calculating revenue but they do make mention of customer rebates. On p.28 of their 2020 10k they throw shipping costs in as a fulfillment cost rather than a separate obligation. This to me sounds like they made the rebate an operating expense but I'm unsure as to how I could prove that or make a stronger case to argue that. 

\-Management barely owns any outstanding shares in the company, less than 10% (6.7% on p.19 of the 2020 10-K) of the executive board owns shares. Apathetic to shareholders interests. And it shows in their low ROIC. If I do some back of the envelope math to calculate out a cost of debt I get 6.83% using the current 30 yea treasury bond rate as my risk free rate. If I just make a roughshod guess that an equity investor is going to want more than 6.83% to take the risk of buying shares then the company is sitting at a crude back of the envelope 9%+ cost of capital. If I don't trust my numbers calculated out on Excel spreadsheet to be accurate then I double check with QuickFS to see if the company makes economic profit and they don't. 10-year ROIC CAGR sits at 1.6% with 2020 ROIC at 4.5%. They don't make money even with my No Child Left Behind math skills trying to wing a valuation on the back of a sticky note. At a P/E of 35.98 you're left with an earnings yield of 2.79% and little free cash flow to speak of because their fixed costs seem to be high enough to warrant wanting to move operations overseas to reduce labor costs (p.5).

TL;DR LAKE may be playing revenue games and the valuation is garbage. Short interest is 18.8% so I'm not the only one thinking this company may be a shitshow.Is Greenwald's Earnings Power Value methodology recognized in the industry?

I know excel is one way to go but are there any websites like that?Are we heading for the lost decade? 

US:
In the US the period between 2000 and 2009 witnessed a massive erosion of wealth in the U.S. economy and the slowest period of economic growth in the U.S. in decades. The S&P 500 recorded its all-time worst decade during this period, featuring a total return of dividends at -9.1 percent, an overall performance lower than during the Great Depression of the 1930s.

JAPAN:
Japan’s economy rose meteorically following World War II, peaking in the 1980s with the largest per capita GNP in the world. This rise led to increased speculation and soaring stock market and real estate valuations.
In the early 1990s, as it became apparent the bubble was about to burst, the Japanese Financial Ministry raised interest rates, and ultimately the stock market crashed and a debt crisis began, halting economic growth and leading to what is now known as the Lost Decade.

Analysts continue to debate the extent of the economic impact of the Lost Decade but they are agreed that it was irrefutable. During the Lost Decade, Japan's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) averaged 1.2%, significantly lower as compared to other G-7 countries. Household savings increased. But that increase did not translate into demand, resulting in deflation for the economy. In many cases, property values have still not recovered and Japanese markets have continued to stagnate through the first decade of the 21st century. As a result, many refer to the period between 1991 and 2010 as the Lost Score, or the Lost 20 Years.May be a dumb question, but as the prevalence of ETFs and mutual funds have grown, are we going to continue seeing  "inflated" stock prices because these investment tools will buy stocks based on their stated goals or strategy no matter what? 

If a company is owned 99% by institutions, is there a way to see how much are owned by ETFs and mutual funds vs hedge funds and active investment groups? My understanding is ETFs and mutual funds only rebalance their holdings, they never really fully exit their position unless they are delisted or go bankrupt.What are your favorite news sources for following the cloud market?Does anyone have a list of value investing shops in Europe?I have a few questions regarding EBITDA and a company that uses a lot of focus on it(there might be others, but this seemed to be the biggest name). 

1. EBITDA is not a standardised measure under GAAP and IFRS accounting. Hence a lot of discretion can be exercised in defining it from firm to firm. So you can't explicitly compare my 100 dollar EBITDA with your 100 dollar EBITDA. 

If my understanding of this is correct then,

2. A firm, AB InBev's own annual report says in a disclosure to shareholders that you can't compare these figures to other firms. But the company excessively talks about this figure during any kind of company releases that they have it higher than P&G Pepsi Coca Cola et cetera? Is this a way to divert attention from other numbers? Something like net income is nowhere to be seen in the "glossy" pages of the report.

3. AB Inbev goes one step further and focuses on "normalised EBITDA" removing "non recurring" items. Yet the non recurring items has had 150-400+ millions worth of restructuring charges every year since 2016. So how is it non recurring? That's literally the definition of recurring.If you're valuing a firm that has multiple businesses in it and you want a weigjted average cost of capital for each segment, do you just use total consolidated shareholders equity as the equity component in the calculation for each segments' WACC?Does anyone have any statistics on customer concentration statistics in online retail(or retail in general).

What are some not-so-obvious factors to look into for valuation purposes? 

Obvious factors would be: current supply/demand, price of aviation fuel, and ticket prices.is there any substance to the "value investment is dying" mantras floating around occasionally? in theory more skilled value investors should mean more competition and thus fewer opportunities available. whats happens if there are too many?  The markets seem to agree, generally, that the stock and bond markets will maintain their current levels, so long as the Federal Reserve continues to print money. But can it last? I think one important thing that people miss – the Federal Reserve, and money printing, is not the economy itself. 

· Unemployment is at an extreme high. There are a lot of people just not doing anything productive.

· The fiscal deficit is at a peacetime high.

· Federal debt-to-GDP is at an all-time high.

· Incremental returns on capital (GDP vs investment, the ICOR ratio), has been falling for years.

· Corporate debt is very high, increasing fragility.

· Corporate profits are also declining. 

· Unemployment is also high, so “national profits”, so-to-speak, are declining.

We have an economy that is fragile. We have an economy that is weak. Yet market valuations (stocks, bonds, real estate), are higher than ever. What am I missing in this equation? 

· Most people are dipping into their savings just to get by.

· Those savings will come out of the stock market.

· The only thing that can curtail that is the government sending more $1,200 checks to everyone in the country, which increases market valuations even further.

· Home prices are so high, that home ownership is out of reach for a greater percentage of the population, than ever.

Ultimately, markets will be decided by the people. The Fed can pump the markets in the short-term, but their printing money cannot replace economic output. It seems as though the situation will snap, at some point. I wonder what I am missing, in this analysis? The national “income statement” is worsening (lower revenues). The national “balance sheet” is worse than it has ever been. Yet, valuations are higher than ever. Unless I have a mistaken notion about the economy, fundamentally, should not this situation have a reckoning? But perhaps the Fed can print money until we are in a zombie economy…? Even if that happens, why would the stock market valuation continue to be at an all-time high?

What about tech and innovation? Can boosts to economic growth from innovation save the situation? With automation and greater use of robotics, perhaps human unemployment is not so important? So long as those people who are unemployed get “basic income” checks, funded from corporate taxes, that should be fine for the economy. Could it be that we have already reached a critical mass for those economics to already work? If so, then I have vastly underestimated the situation, as I thought we were decades away from that.Anybody seen an estimate of how many $s the fed is gonna have to print by 2022 to keep rates at 0 (and potentially 20+ year rates under 2%)?Those who work at funds or any institutional setup where you do fundamental investing: how do funds use options other than for hedging reasons?

Thoughts?Since the ECB deposit rates are negative (-0.50%) and european banks must hold their cash and reserves at the ECB, does this mean that, for instance, a bank like BNP Paribas with a total of 155 billion euros (Cash + balances at central banks) would be losing 0.5% of that each year having to deposit it at the ECB? So would it be losing 7.8 billion euros a year?

What we see in our holdings, rather, is an assembly of companies that we partly own and that, on a weighted basis, are **earning more than 20% on the net tangible equity capital required to run their businesses**\*\*\*\*\*. These companies, also, earn their profits without employing excessive levels of debt. Returns of that order by large, established and understandable businesses are remarkable under any circumstances.

I recently finished up an MBA where I had a rough overview of how to put together a 3 statement financial model. Our class didn't look at the applications for this type of modeling. Is a 3 statement financial model something that can be directly applied to the valuation of a company for security analysis? I saw the Corporate Finance Institute has a lot of resources on modeling but nothing I could find on how to apply security analysis.

PS: Sorry for my english, it isn't my main language.It seems most of the discussions in this subreddit focus on individual stock analysis (which makes sense).  But can anyone point me in the direction of resources for analysis of more broad securities, such as ETFs and bonds?

Specifically, I see a lot of discussion of how one uncovers and interprets value in individual companies, but surely most of this won't apply to something like SPY or gold since there's no underlying company to analyze.

**Is there a better sub for this kind of stuff?  Or are these discussions scattered throughout this sub and I'm just not seeing it?**

For context: My current strategy is just DCA over a 50/50 split of SPY and bonds (which, so far, has worked out fine), but it's obviously the most basic, naive approach.  My plan has been to start with this portfolio and, as I continue to invest in it, slowly refine it as I learn more about this stuff and can focus into niche fields.  The discussions found in this subreddit are very insightful, but I currently don't have the capacity to invest the appropriate time in individual stock analysis.

Thanks.Do you have opinion about Microsoft board of directors?  Hi,

Question regarding multiples: are all equity multiples trading multiples and all entity multiples transaction multiples? (I still don’t really get the link between the multiples like EV/EBITDA and the classification of trading and transaction multiples)So I am experimenting with doing DCF with EPS rather than FCF as I am wary of all the inputs that go into FCF.

Is the PV of let's say my 5 year EPS stream plus a Terminal Value = Value of business? i.e. in same way as using FCF?

The number i get is obviously very small compared to FCF as it a per share number so i am not sure i should be thinking about it the same way?

For e.g. Disney EPS p.a. is around $5-10 with a total PV + TV of around $120. If using FCF, the number would be far larger, and then i would divide by number of shares to get value / share. 

Because I am using a per share number to begin with, perhaps the $120 reflects intrinsic value per share? i.e. I have arrived at the per share valuation already?

Is that correct?Is there something for Quality Investing? I found few references here and there and one book but nothing more. Any Investor ?(other than Fisher)?1 Most of companies report "Long term debt' in single item on 10-k,

What is the difference between (1) capitalization of reserves through bonus issue and (2) capitalization of reserves without bonus issue but followed by a stock split?  


I'm used to (1) but not (2).Can anyone point me in the direction of any resources related to equity and/or credit market analysis?  Anything specifically related to allocations and/or volatility?

My goal is to focus on a naive portfolio which is just split between stocks and bonds, e.g. through ETFs like SPY and TLT.  Instead of trying to forecast which positions I should take to net higher profits, I could instead focus on shifting the allocation between the two (or more) classes (possibly within hard limits, like 90/10 or 75/25 splits).

My idea is that, in terms of long-term, passive investing, such a portfolio should be pretty sound (at least if you follow the [advice of Graham](https://obliviousinvestor.com/benjamin-graham-on-asset-allocation/)).  So it should make for a good place to start and expand from.  Since sticking to broad ETFs and bonds makes sense for such a portfolio, I figured I should focus on learning the characteristics of the factors involved in the price movement of indices and changes in interest rates, probably specifically over longer periods of time.

As far as for a focus on volatility, I think it can be an interesting angle to focus on (versus something like price forecasting or predicting direction).  I have long term goals of using options against my shares to produce additional income, so being able to asses volatility in the underlying assets can possibly make the endeavor worth it.  To that end, I wouldn't even be necessarily trying to beat the market, per se, but rather trying to net maximum income.

Any thoughts on this?  Really I'm trying to find the correct vocabulary to put to these ideas to be able to start Googling it, but I'm having a hard time.  It's kind of like [factor investing](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/investment-ideas/what-is-factor-investing), where you focus on [macroeconomic factors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macroeconomic-factor.asp), but specific to the [equity market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equitymarket.asp) and [credit market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_market.asp) as a whole.

* On their official page, the P/B figure for 2020 is 0.65 ([https://www.globalxetfs.com/funds/mlpa/](https://www.globalxetfs.com/funds/mlpa/))
* If I calculate it as **Price/((Net Assets-Liabilities)/Number of Outstanding Shares)**, I get a ratio of 1.60 (That would be **3.23/((461001636-174232552)/142550000)** \- those are the official figures from the issuer's website)

For example, do you prefer all the assumptions for the P&L (e.g. volume growth, price growth, FX change, gross margin, etc) all in one section line after line... or do you prefer the assumptions for the revenue line to be under the revenue line (say in italics), the Gross Margin assumption under the Gross Profit line, etc.The market rallied today and s&p gained 5+%

Thank you all.I've been banging my head against the wall trying to write a valuation engine and determining the correct CAGR for dividends. I can't work out what the correct start and beginning values are, and it's not helped by the fact that multiple info sites list different dividend CAGR for the same security.

Specifically, I can't work out which model is best as all seem sound logically. Models I tried. I'm trying to calculate the 5Y CAGR for say SYY (input data I obtained below). 

**Method#1 Map all dividends to the year they were paid**

Here I would take all the dividend payment dates and add them up into their respective date. In my sample data I would then end up with 0.9 for 2020 (incomplete year). Therefore I need to skip 2020 and use 2019 (latest full year) to 2014 for 5Y CAGR. The calculation then would be 

END: {'dividend': 1.56, 'period': 2019}

BEGIN : {'dividend': 1.17, 'period': 2014}

Result: (1.56/1.17)\^(1/5)-1 = 5.92

**Method#2 Aggregate last 4 payments and call them a year**

Here I end up with

END: {'dividend': 1.68, 'periods': \['2020-04-02', '2020-01-02', '2019-10-03', '2019-07-03'\]}

BEGIN: {'dividend': 1.19, 'periods': \['2015-06-30', '2015-03-31', '2014-12-30', '2014-10-01'\]}

Result: (1.68/1.19)\^(1/5)-1 = 7.14

**What is correct?**

These both cover 5 years worth of quarterly payments and lead to vastly different results. In addition,

I found these two sites that list 5Y CAGR as yet other values

***Finbox*** *(*[*https://finbox.com/NYSE:SYY/explorer/div\_share\_cagr\_5y*](https://finbox.com/NYSE:SYY/explorer/div_share_cagr_5y)*)* 

END: 1.56

BEGIN: 1.16 (Where do they get 1.17 from?)

Result: (1.56/1.16)\^(1/5)-1 = 6.1%

***Dividend-screener*** *(*[*https://dividendstocks.cash/dividend-screener*](https://dividendstocks.cash/dividend-screener)*)*

Doesn't list working and just shows 5 year CAGR as 8.15%

***My input data***

Now all of these results are quite different and I don't see method in the madness.

Hi All,

I'm curious what peoples' thoughts are on something I've pondering about lately. I have a feeling with this pandemic stuff that globalization might be less of a factor going forward, particularly for sectors deemed of national importance, such as pharmaceutical supplies. I could also see supply chains moving to a more localized model, because clearly investing majorly in a few key countries solely due to cost is very risky if a black swan event like this occurs.

Given this, what would happen to total stock market returns in the US and abroad? I could see the dollar losing strength because there will be less demand for using it as a medium of global exchange. At the same time, I feel like the current economic setup is people will buy our (constantly deflating) dollars in exchange for their exports, which benefits their countries too. Is it really in countries' best interest not to sell to the country that imports so many goods around the world? At the same time, can we continue to consume at the rate we are given the pension situation, national debt, etc.?

Imagine my surprise when I found that BMW's beta is actually LOWER than VW's! Just for some perspective, in the 2019 model year, the least expensive BMW was the X1 retailing for about $35,000; the least expensive VW was the Jetta for about $18.5K. I think BMW also positions itself as a luxury auto maker. But let's assume that BMW produces cars that are *more* discretionary than VW.

Why the *lower* beta? 


We know that (a) operating leverage; and (b) debt can also effect beta:

1. operating leverage, i.e., EBIT Variability Measure = % change in EBIT / % change in revenue

  | BMW | VW
--- | --- | ---
2018 | EBIT = 8.6, Revenue = 96.8 | E = 21.1, R = 235.8
2019 | E = 8.7, R = 104.2 | E = 18.7, R = 252.6

^ values in millions of euros

BMW's EBIT Variability Measure = (1 - (8.7/8.6))/(1 - (104.2/96.8)) = +15.18%

VW's EBIT Var Measure = -59.69%


How am I supposed to interpret these numbers? Negative EBIT variability?

2. leverage

In 2019, BMW had 168.127 in debt v 228.034 in assets (73.72%); VW's ratio was 364.420 (debt) to 488.071 (assets) or 74.66%.

So BMW has the *slightest* edge when it comes to the DTE. But is that enough to make the difference?

They add to their “Cash from operations” a line of 5,9 billion euros called “Other insurance revenues/charges to be collected”.

I'm analyzing The Walt Disney Co. (DIS) for a project in my Finance Technology course where I must gather liquidity, efficiency, leverage, coverage, and profitability ratios for the past fiscal year and compare them to the *industry average*.

Gathering the financial statements to compute the ratios for Disney alone isn't tough since I just got them off the [SEC.gov](https://SEC.gov) website. However, I cannot seem to find consistent data on the industry that Disney is in. Some websites even claim Disney to be in a different industry than the previous, and they can't seem to give accurate ratios or all of the ratios that I need.

I've resorted to going onto the SEC site and gathering 4 different stocks that are *probably* in the same industry and computing all of those ratios individually. Before I commit to that, can anybody give me any resources that would provide reliable and consistent data?

Company is listed as PAC on the NYSE.I'm confused regarding the different ways I've seen Common Stock and Additional Paid-In Capital appear on companies' balance sheets.

On some (ex. Facebook), Common Stock is minimal or zero, while APIC is much higher, and this makes sense to me. The par value is quite minimal compared to the money paid by investors for newly-issued shares. However, on others (ex. FTS in the Toronto Stock Exchange) I see a huge number for Common Stock and a much smaller number for APIC, and this is the part that I can't understand.

A lot of ratio analysis can be done with more breakup. Right? 

Note - say some expenses are more important than others and are specific to the industry or company or nature of business.
Like RM costs, Power&Fuel, depreciation (depletion), etc., are more important in a manufacturing setup.
Marketing expenses for automobiles, DD&A for OMCs, etc.

Expenses like Stationary, Bank charges, etc etc are not so important and can be clubbed as miscellaneous expenses.


Essentially I want to get breakup of expenses forming part of COGS for at least the past 5 years.

Finished reading *Dao of Capital* which suggests tobins Q as the best proxy for future investment returns on market indexes. The obvious problem I saw is that it's value should naturally be higher right now than in say 1980, regardless of whether it was expensive then, because tech firms can't legally place a market estimate of their intangible assets on their books. Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Ebay, Google, etc all have high price to books because their "brilliant idea" can't be capitalized (accounting wise). The fact that they have made high ROIC over a long time frame proves this logically.

I found one estimate from (I think) 2010 stating 34% of firms' total capital was in off balance sheet intangibles, which seems high when you look at the Q ratio you would get compared to what other proxies for investment returns suggest. At 15% of total capital being intangible, you get a q ratio of 1.7 for Q4 2019, which seems about right when you look at earnings yields to risk free yield.What is the difference between lease liabilities and operating leases?submitted a minute ago by 3feetofair

I've found a neat dataset that seems like it could have some relationship to a company's share price.

The dataset is pretty noisy, so I took its 3 month ema, and compared it to the share price of a relevant company over a ten year period. I used the lm function in r which gave me an adjusted r2 of 0.81-0.82, and a p value of ~2e-16. Before applying the moving average, I was seeing adjusted r2s around .57-.58. I've done a bit of signal processing stuff before, but I just don't know enough about finance to say if that is really significant. Every control dataset I tried gave me an r2 of -.01-.01. It does seem to be leading, and the correlation peaks at 1-2 months.

I could clean up the dataset a lot, but it would be very labor intensive, so I want to keep playing with this before I go that route. I know for sure that it has some things in it that shouldn't have been included, so I would expect that the correlation would improve after removing them.

Where would you start if you wanted to see if a strategy could be developed from this? I've looked at thinkorswim, but I don't see an obvious way to import your own data. I know a bit about r from previous things I've done, but none of that is related to finance.

I'm convinced cash flow metrics are superior when it comes to profitability metrics like ROE and value metrics like EV/FCF, but whether to use pre-tax or after-tax cash flow is less clear to me.

On one hand, the equity of company A with a 10% tax rate will always be superior to the equity of company B with a 22% tax rate, all else equal, since more cash is available to shareholders. But when it comes to profitability metrics, both businesses are producing equal cash flow with equal assets, only one company pays slightly more of that cash flow to the government. Then, is it really accurate to say company A is "better" than company B in regards to efficient use of capital?

I took that and divided it by their diluted shares outstanding on the 10k (216.9M) and got an EPS of $4.40, divided it by the current share price ($36.22 at close today) to get an artificial P/E of 8.23x, and took its inverse to get a 12.15% earnings yield. 

Did I do the math right on this whole process? Did I mess up? I have no clueHas anyone invested in Yield Street’s Prism Fund? How much detail do they provide on the funds investments?

https://www.yieldstreetprismfund.com/YieldStreet-Prism-Fund-Prospectus.pdfIs it worth considering near-cash current assets when calculating EV? The strict definition only considers cash, but aren’t accounts receivable and short term investments pretty similar to cash? 

I’m evaluating OPRT, and if I consider accounts receivable to be considered equivalent to cash, then it has a negative EV value. Is there a good reason to strictly use cash for an EV calculation?>The amount available to be drawn under the facility at any point in time is the lesser of:  
  The facility limit  
  The loan advance amount that supports a debt yield of 5.75% (ongoing requirement of 5.50%)  
  The loan advance amount that supports a debt service cover ratio of at least 1.50 to 1.00 (ongoing requirement of 1.25 to 1.00), and  
  45% of the market value of the collateral property (ongoing requirement of 50% of the market value of collateral property)

I'm probably stupid, but just to make it really really sure, the ongoing requirement here will only affect the company's access to undrawn line of credit and does not have any implication on the debts the company had already drawn, is that correct?How often do you screen whole stocks or stocks in your universe to be sure that your current holding stocks are the best in the market? i think i'm too poor at comparing. any advice on this process would be helpful. thanks in advance. Does anyone follow the buy/sell behavior of executives for a company when determining if they should buy a stock?

Sometimes I will look at the insider trading, see if the trade was part of a pre-arranged 10b5-1 plan and if not, take that as an indicator to buy or sell that stock. E.g. [here is the insider trading](http://www.openinsider.com/search?q=goog) for GOOG and if the execs and VPs are selling and it's not due to 10b5-1 I take that as a data point for the "sell" argument.Are companies for example in france,japan,germany required to have annual report written in english if the are not on US exchange?Does anyone know where I can get full Berkshire anual letters ?

https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1990.htmlWhat are the differences between loan (receivables) sales and ABS securitization? They both move assets off balance sheet. Loan sale seems a simpler (and shorter?) process than ABS esp. if there are existing buyers for the company that is selling? It also seems more clear-cut than securitization as lender may still participate in servicing after ABS is sold.

What about other aspects? Price? Risks? Logistics? When is it good/bad for the company to use one vs. the other?

And is it fair to assume that if the lender sells/securitize most of its loan assets then effectively it becomes an originator and earn fees as such?Is there any chance I could find past quarterly letters from Tom Russo?

Thanks.Is there a website where I can check historical M&A transactions? Multiples paid in specific. I was wondering if there is any "standardized" literature series on analyzing specific industries (or sub-sectors) out there.

As an example, let's say I'm completely new to the industrials sector and don't know anything about it. I look at FinViz and find that there's 25 industries in this sector. I would like to learn a medium amount about each of them. Is there any series of books/article series/primers that would deal with each industry in the sector?

If not, is there a book series with each book focusing on one of the big sectors? (Other than what's in the wiki)

If all else fails, do you mind sharing any advice on what to do (a standardized process, if you will) when someone is brand new to a sector/industry and wants to learn its ins and outs before analyzing any specific company?

Thanks!  


(P.S: I know that Google exists. The reasons I'm asking my question in this sub and going beyond Google are: 1) Ideally, I'm looking for sources that are more academic in nature, which are tougher to find or come across through a google search, 2) If I try to google any specific industry/sub-sector, I'm ultimately going to be flooded with results relating to the sector that the industry belongs to rather than the industry itself, 3) Most google results will be geared more towards industry statistics/general info rather than sources dealing with how the industry works, its business models, its "5 forces", cost factors, historical development, etc, 4) The standardization aspect. If I google the consumer electronics industry, for example, I'm more likely going to find sources that don't deal with the industry top-to-bottom, and those sources are unlikely to include guides on other sibling industries written using the same approach. I personally prefer standardized approaches if and when I can find them.)Fairly new to the concept of value investing, but I've read that in today's market this strategy is rather obsolete. I can't seem to wrap my head around why it would be obsolete. It revolves around finding undervalued stocks to invest, which would therefore only lead to a net gain overtime as it approaches its true value. 

I guess what I'm asking is, what makes value investing obsolete in today's  market when the concept of it utilizes the purchasing of undervalued stocks? Any clarification would be appreciated, thanks.Does anyone know how the stock dividend works exactly?

On the Internet, I can find that it's actually a dividend in the form of newly issued shares. But in the book "Why Stocks Go Up and Down", William Pike presents it as analogous to a stock split with only a minor accounting difference:

&#x200B;

>When a company pays a stock dividend, the par value is not changed, as with a stock split. With the par value remaining the same, there is an increase in the dollar figure in Common at Par, and that is balanced by a decrease in Additional Paid in Capital. For JMC with a Par Value of $1, after a 900% stock dividend, the dollar figure in the Common at Par account would increase from $500 to $5,000, reflecting the new total of 5,000 shares outstanding. That increase of $4,500 would be offset by a decrease of $4,500 in Additional Paid in Capital.

&#x200B;

I am trying to understand how that works but I have failed to get it so far. And after finding nobody explaining a stock dividend as Pike does, I am even more confused.In the past 30 years, interest rates have plummeted.

Excluding current events (i.e. up to 2018 or so), the stock market expected returns from dividends + buybacks + earnings growth hasn't decreased nearly as much. 

Since the risk free rate has greatly decreased, this makes the "risk premium" much higher than it has been in the past, even though stock market returns have been to far from average.

That begs the question: Why has the implied risk premium been so higher for the past 10 or so years? I would have thought PE expansion would have been inevitable due to low interest rates (not talking about the past year, just in general).Like many others, I have began researching heavily and investing in the NYSE/NASDAQ in the tail end of February as the crash was beginning.

I'm most interested in finding the trailing EV/EBITDA for S&P 500 and Russell 2000 but can't find the data anywhere.Every year in his letter to his investors, François Rochon of Giverny Capital shows a table comparing the growth in his portfolio's intrinsic value (estimated by adding the EPS growth and average dividend yield of the portfolio) to the market performance (share price + dividends) of his portfolio. He does the same for the S&P 500.

For example in his 2019 letter, this calculation can be found on page 10. 

[http://www.givernycapital.com/en/doc/236/Giverny\_Capital\_-\_Annual\_Letter\_2019\_web\_.pdf](http://www.givernycapital.com/en/doc/236/Giverny_Capital_-_Annual_Letter_2019_web_.pdf))

I'd like to do the same for my individual portfolio. 

I know how to calculate EPS growth + average dividend yield for an individual stock but I do not know how to do this for my portfolio. 

Part of what trips me up is that I don't know how to account for transactions that occur during the year (for e.g. selling out completely of a share, adding to an already owned share, buying into a share I didn't own before then, etc.). 

Does anyone know how to do this or can point me to a resource that describes how to do this (for e.g. a Google Sheet or an article)?Found a company and started reading their annual report. Got to the depreciation footnotes and they say they're doing straight line depreciation but they depreciate office spacr and furniture at 3 years each.

Does this sound right to anyone else?Anybody read Stephen Penman's book? Dying to get this resolved, but not sure if anyone can help :(. It's on his valuation model.  

&#x200B;

I get the logic behind it, but there's something that really doesn't make sense to me,

Valuation model: [https://janav.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/accountingvalue-residualformula.jpg?w=680&h=314](https://janav.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/accountingvalue-residualformula.jpg?w=680&h=314)

It doesn't work because the valuation actually does not change with increased initial book values, as all it cares about is the return % on the book value itself.

Consider the following example, in which we value a company using only earnings next year.

Required rate of return: 10%

Company A: $3 EPS, $20 BPS, implying ROCE: 15%

* Residual earnings: (15% - 10%) \* 20 = 1
* **Valuation**: 20 + 1/(10% - 0%) = **$30**

I get the logic behind anchoring your valuations behind residual earnings, but how does it make sense that the above company’s valuation does not change with increased book value?

Let’s say all we did was change BPS to $1,000, which implies a ROCE of now 0.3%

* Residual earnings: (0.3% - 10%) \* 1,000 = -97
* **Valuation**: 1,000 - 97/(10% - 0%) = **$30**.

How does that make sense here? The initial book value has zero impact because the decreased ROCE offsets it through negative residual earnings.

According to this model, even a company with 1 trillion dollars in book value is still only worth $30. I'd obviously love to buy a company with $1 trillion in book value for only $30.

What am I missing here? It seems like the model only cares about calculating a number that yields your required rate of return (which would be always be $30 as it returns $3 next year). It fails to account for value for initial BV if the residuals turn negative.[deleted]Do you work as a professional investor or analyst? What did your career and education path look like?

I am trying to put together a DDM model that values the value of a bank's equity. Because of the COVID crisis, I am estimating very large charge offs in 2020 and 2021. However, this does not really impact the valuation of the model much, as the dividends are not really affected. 

There must be a way that the charge offs (thus the decrease in Net Income) should factor in the value the model outputs, but it does not for me. The construction of my model is thus obviously flawed but I don't know in what what way. So how should the increased charge offs, thus a large loss and a decrease in equity factor into the valuation?

Should the charge offs change the assumed cost of equity? Or the assumed dividend payout ratio?Does anyone know where to get the data for the individual loans in a MBS?

He says it is because the proportion of fixed costs that make up overall costs decreases as a market grows. If so, how can companies with economies of scale grow if they already dominate most of the existing market share? And how did the companies that he discusses in Competition Demystified (e.g. Cisco) continue to dominate successfully in a growing market (the enterprise router market grew rapidly from its inception) whereas other companies (e.g. Compaq and GM) saw their economies of scale advantage deteriorate due to a growing market?

I need some help here. The most quoted stock is IMBBY which is in $ and sold via OTC, which isn’t supported by my broker unfortunately. On their website Imperial states that their stock is also sold on the LSE but I don’t understand how the price is about 100x higher than on OTC. +- 1500 GBP and $18 on OTC.

Do i understand it right that main beauty for 401k/IRA accounts is that you don't pay gains until you exit account?

Let say capital gains tax is 15%

**Regular brokerage**

1) Bought AAA shares for $1000, sold for $2000, left with  $1850 after tax of $150 

2) Bought BBB shares for $1850, sold for $3700, left with **$3422.50** after tax of $227.50 

**401k/IRA brokerage**

1) Bought AAA shares for $1000, sold for $2000, left with  $2000

2) Bought BBB shares for $2000, sold for $4000, left with $4000

reached 59.5 years, left with **$3550** after tax of  $450

Did i get it right?

Also in following quote from WB's annual letter both scenarios would produce same result if they are in 401k/IRA brokerage account?

>Imagine that Berkshire had only $1, which we put in a security that doubled by yearend and was then sold. Imagine further that we used the after-tax proceeds to repeat this process in each of the next 19 years, scoring a double each time. At the end of 20 years, the 34% capital gains tax that we would have paid on the profits from each sale would have delivered about $13,000 to the government and we would be left with about $25,250. Not bad. If, however, we made a single fantastic investment that itself doubled 20 times during 20 years, our dollar would grow to $1,048,576. Were we then to cash out, we would pay a 34% tax of roughly $356,500 and be left with about $692,000.I am fairly new into the world of market research/security analysis.

So a car rental company buys a car for 100k then sells it later for 90k.  That 10k difference is that just depreciation expense.

I know some have taken issue with this company due to the lack of transparency with the independent auditor but I wanted to hear some opinions given the new 10k. It seems the company is generating some cash flow from operations ($15m) whilst the cash flow from financing has gone sharply down (-$7m). This is by no means a long term trend but may provide a bit of promise for the company. Account receivables were also consistently bad with the company before but it seems they have finally managed to collect payments from customers ($67m to $400k).

I've always been quite skeptical of how deep the discount for the company is but I am failing to see anything wrong with the company except the EPS and the fact that they have a lot of dealings with mainland China (red flag).

There is a couple of details that bother me though. 

&#x200B;

In 2018, the company consolidated a nonprofitable business unit through a master transfer agreement with an entity fully owned by the CEO. Additionally, the current line of credit is secured by another entity owned by the CEO. 

 Also, the company transferred almost 4m in preferred stock to another entity owned by the CEO as notes payable. The liquidation value of the preferred was $5/sh, while the current common trade at around $2. 

Ultimately, the income structure. The company is entitled to 10% of FCF from the properties in its portfolio after the first 8% that goes to another entity owned by the CEO. I understand that this waterfall structure is common in PE. However, is the fact that the LP and sponsor are both controlled by the same person a red flag? 

&#x200B;

In summary, the business model seems sound. But I have the feeling that the owner/CEO  might be using the common shareholders to enriching himself.

I realize many of them may be junk but every once in a while you get a Draftkings or NikolaGuys hi,

why we don't account for out of money stock options when doing valuation ?

Simplified example:

2 companies with identical earnings, FCF, etc.

1st has 1,000,000 shares out standing, 2nd has 1,000,000 shares out standing, and 1,000,000 options exercisable at $30.

today's stock price for both companies $25.

When using treasury stock method both companies will have same fully diluted shares outstanding number = 1,000,000. And same EV.

So valuation is the same, but those "hanging" stock options can be exercised one day. And if you are interested in the company that means that you are betting on it's bright future and mostly focusing on scenario when they are about certain to be exercised. Example let say in 2 years stock price goes to $60 for both companies, clearly 1st company was a better bet.

These spreads seem to narrow before recessions, but I am having a hard time wrapping my brain around why.

My concern is that with overall climate we are in and the volatility that exists today I might be shooting myself in the foot doing this. January is only two months after the election and if Biden wins I’m not sure what the market will do.https://roy60e.substack.com/p/spot-cookers-like-a-pro-providing

I.e. lets say we're using 5 years of historical data to forecast, and there's a non-recurring restructuring cost in year 1. If we remove it there, do we add back the money as cash on asset side, if we'll in turn be increasing the RE on the L+E side? Then will we be increasing cash for the remaining years (2-5) by that amount?

Basically I'm confused as to where I should be placing the non-recurring costs.Does anybody know of an emerging markets fund managed by somebody with a good reputation?I’m relatively new to investing and got into it with the intention of buying and holding stocks for the long term.

I have been following the subreddit for a while now and I have to say I am a big fan of reading some of the in-depth analysis provided here. Some of the old links to letters are fascinating and I have learned a ton just following along. 

Anyways, one of the company's I have been researching over the past almost year is Teradyne. While reading their latest 10Q, I come across the below paragraph under their revenue section which describes them selling their accounts receivables to third-parties. I am unfamiliar with the mechanics of this and how the below works, if someone could point me in the right direction for a resource or provide a quick explainer that would be great.

From 10Q:

 *Accounts Receivable*

*Teradyne sells certain trade accounts receivables on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions pursuant to factoring agreements. Teradyne accounts for these transactions as sales of receivables and presents cash proceeds as a cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Total trade accounts receivable sold under the factoring agreements were $46.8 million and $41.7 million for the three months ended March 29, 2020 and March 31, 2019, respectively. Factoring fees for the sales of receivables were recorded in interest expense and were not material.*

I am looking for a possible reason that they might sell their accounts receivables and if this is possibly any type of red flag? When I peruse Google, it seems that a typical reason that a company would sell accounts receivables is to raise cash, but TER typically has a good amount of cash on hand. 

I appreciate any help,Hi All, I was reading Barron's today and came across the below quote - 

"Hertz’s debt somewhere in the range of 30-40 cents on  
the dollar. If the stock actually were  
worth something, the debt ought to  
fetch something close to par."

&#x200B;

I want make sure to avoid companies where the debt is below par and add this as a filter while selecting stocks. Where can I find this debt information of companies ? Is there a website where I can lookup companies and see what their debt is trading at ?Can someone tell me if my thought process is correct here because I have a feeling it isn't:

&#x200B;

Say I find a company I want to value and see if it's making economic profit. I calculated out ROIC to be at 7% let's just say. I calculate out their cost of debt to be 9%. Right out of the gate I assume the company isn't creating value. Because I know that the cost of equity has to be higher than the cost of debt otherwise you would have no equity investors. You'd just have bondholders. If equity is 3x as risky as bonds and cost of debt is higher than cost of equity then you wouldn't have risk takers if they knew their upside was limited or nonexistent. So if I see that a company's cost of debt is greater than their ROIC am I able to safely assume the company doesn't make economic profit? If not, where am I going wrong in my thinking?Questions on FCF calculation:

1. should I subtract foreign currency exchange losses?

In CFO net unrealized foreign currency (gain) loss is added back (since it’s non cash)

And cash effect of fx is shown as separate item at very end of cashflow statement after CFF

“Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents”

My reasoning to subtract this number is that it’s a cost of doing business as international company. But I saw calculations for FCF for international companies and most (all) of them seem to ignore it.

2. should increase in restricted cash be counted as capex? (letters of credit related to facility leases)

My reasoning is that it's cash needed to run a business (to get into lease), though on another side it's "not burning", money are restricted but no spent.What does it realistically mean when a stock has a P/E ratio of 1,275? Specifically, I was recently looking at Zoom for video conferencing when I noticed this. 

These absurdly high ratios can’t be accurate right? Otherwise, why would you rationally invest in a company like that? I assume there has be some mistake with how P/E is calculated that makes it distorted. Also maybe in today’s world, perhaps price to earnings just isn’t a very good indicator to look at anymore?So I'm looking at Biglari Holdings (I've made no commitments to buying it or whatever have you, I'm reading their financial statements to learn more about the company and also get better at navigating these documents) and they report their segment information. They own Maxim. They split their segment capex and depreciation and amortization by segment but Maxim seemingly has NO capex and NO depreciation in these segments. I have no idea how that could possibly be the case. They have $16,549,000 in identifiable assets and $742,000 in EBIT. If I wanted to see Maxim's ROIC, would it make sense to do use identifiable assets as invested capital? Or is that not smart to do? Is that sort of information able to be found on the 10-k or is it not available to shareholders through financial disclosures? I'm actually very curious as to why Maxim would have no capex and no depreciation (short of lying about it of course, I'm not smart enough to find that yet). My initial hunch is that they earn enough through their own operations to just reinvest it back into the business and would therefore not have capex or depreciation expenses to show but that makes no sense. Someone help me out here because I'm genuinely lost.When in 10-k

The traditional formula for ROA over a period is earnings before interest/average assets. Since 100% of depreciation would be captured in EBI, but less than 100% of depreciation is captured in average assets, would the resulting ROA be understated? In other words, is the denominator bigger than it should be since average assets wouldn't factor in 100% of the depreciation taken in the period but the EBI would?What makes to hold Growth stocks even at the price where future growth projection is already taken into account?

with rough assumption that EPS is good proxy of FCF. when the consensus is expecting 25% growth for next 5 years. if current P/E is 25 which can be regarded as it's implying the growth expectation. the only reason to hold it that i can think of is you're expecting 25% growth and assuming that you would exit at same multiple after 5 years.

The problem is if it would be able to sustain P/E of 25. that's implying that the market's future growth expectation would remain same even after 5 years. which is more than foregoing expectation. thus actual expectation implied here is 25% growth for next 10 years not just 5 years. then why would to hold Growth Stocks when Growth expectation is fully baked into the price?Hi sorry if this is the wrong place to ask.

(10K SEC Extraction)

Hey guys I had a question about analyzing statements/building models. I'm taking securities analysis in college right now and my current assignment is to build a financial model of Microsoft. I need to gather 5 years of historical data.

I'm scraping 10k data off of the SEC and I've noticed when I copy and paste the data directly off of the SEC it's categorized differently depending on the year the 10k was filed. This makes it difficult to organize data because I originally thought you could just copy and paste from 10k's and have everything lineup.

Here's an example. (Microsoft Balance Sheet 2019 vs Microsoft Balance Sheet 2016)

https://preview.redd.it/85l9jyhh4t551.png?width=1952&format=png&auto=webp&s=245b8ecdc9ce327fb5050ce91125525c86fc729a

I've highlighted just a few of the categories that are different between the two statements causing them to not line up correctly.

**My question is... How would I recategorize these for modeling purposes this way the models line up correctly for modeling?**

I can't just get rid of them because then the balance sheet in my model won't balance. I did something like this for the sake of getting my balance sheet to add up for my model. I don't really think this is the best way to go about it though. For example, I highly doubt that from 2016 to 2019 Microsofts operating lease right-of-use assets went from 0 to 36,477.

My professor is describing it as Assets/Equity but that doesn't really make sense to me.

Isn't leverage the amount of debt you use to fund your assets relative to the amount of equity?

So wouldn't leverage actually be Assets - Equity?

For example, if I had 500,000 in assets and 200,000 in equity then my liabilities would be 300,000. Wouldn't that 300,000 be the leverage I had tied up in my assets?

If I did 500,000 in assets divided by 200,000 in equity then I get 2.5. I don't understand how that is supposed to be considered a measurement of leverage since it's a measurement of equity and equity is not debt.Why do some value investors (e.g. Polen Capital) like companies that have net cash on the balance sheet when that cash could be reinvested back into the business at higher returns (assuming that the business generates high ROIC)?So Damodaran calculates FCFE for banks as net income minus the reinvestment in regulatory capital.

For example, I'm valuing Farfetch and I've done most of my projections, and after a few years my cash balances turn negative as the company is currently loss making and has had CAPEX investments. So obviously I will project some debt issuance in the future, but because the retained earnings are going down, the company gets increasingly leveraged over time, and I don't think its reasonable that they will rely only on debt for financing and depending on scale, the leverage might not be healthy. 

&#x200B;

Secondly, I can project secondary offerings of equity, but I haven't found any resources that talked about this and I did not learn it in class either. Anyways, the number of shares will depend the stock price at issuance so I do not know how to do that either. 

&#x200B;

What I'm thinking of doing is something like this: 1. set a target cash minimum amount that is constant or grows at a fixed percentage.  2. Use the target minimum to find the total annual financing needs. 3. Project Debt and Equity issuance at the current D/E proportion. 4. Use the current stock price \*(1+Cost of equity)\^(number of years in future) to calculate new number of shares. 

Is this correct, or hopefull there is a better way? 

Thanks.Anyone have good insight/pointers to currency exchange specifically USD to AUD? 

Ive scratched the surface on AUD and looks like its commodity demand and china demand as the major influencers.I'm looking at $RMCF and they had $1,402,332 of net income before their income tax provision, which was $368,500. If I use $1,402,332 as their actual net income and then add back depreciation ($895,395), you get $2,297,727. Divide their current market cap by that adjusted net income and you get the company having a P/E of 10.26x. Am I doing this right? I usually just go straight to the cash flow statement rather than sit with the income statement. So if I use this halfassed calculation the stock may be cheap right now, but I don't know if my halfassed math is actually sensible.

In this chapter he introduces "net-nets", i.e. companies that are selling for less than their net current asset value. The idea being that these assets were going to be converted to cash in less than a year, so it makes sense that the company should be at least worth that much. Unfortunately there are hardly any companies that trade below there NCAV today.
I have a couple theories as to why that is

1) companies are asset-light compared to 50 years ago. Goodwill/intangible assets are becoming a bigger % of assets than 50 years ago.

2) The prevalence of stock screeners have arbitraged away all the net-net opportunities.

Market cap is calculated by multiplying the stock price by the outstanding shares and thus giving the market value of a company. However, when a company goes public, it usually doesn't issue 100% of its stocks (100% of the company).

I'm doing a simple (educational) DCF for Slack and am trying to find a simple way to deal with the mammoth tech RSU grants in my calculations.

They present the total count of currently granted RSUs and *exercised* options as part in the securities section of the 10-K.

They *also* list SBC, VC funding and public market funding as gains and expenses in their cash flows under these summarised headings (more detail in another table).

Would I need to project the latter **expenses** as part of FCF or is the *only* true damage from stock grants the dilution of **total shares** (as laid out [here](https://www.ft.com/content/6999dc72-893e-11e9-97ea-05ac2431f453)) - in which case I could just use the total share amount from the former table and project it into the future to get FCF per share?

Not understanding the other side of the trade makes me feel uneasy.Given that the underlyings are the same between $GOOGL and $GOOG, theoretically the only difference between the two classes of shares are that one comes with voting rights and the other doesn’t. So the fact that Class C shares of $GOOG with no voting rights are trading at a premium to Class A shares of $GOOGL with voting rights seems to imply that the addition of voting rights actually is a net negative in some way. Are there any reasons as to why this might be the case?

My initial inclination is that while retail investors would likely see little to no benefit from having voting rights due to holding a negligible amount of shares individually, an institutional investor would with the amount of shares that they might amass definitely derive value in being able to influence the direction of the future of the company with added voting rights. Perhaps there are legal aspects, however, to owning shares with voting rights versus shares without voting rights that have an impact?

Another possibility I thought of that might be responsible for the price discrepancy was a potential difference in liquidity between $GOOGL Class A shares and $GOOG Class C shares. I don’t think it would be unreasonable to assume that $GOOGL shares with voting rights would be held more by longer term investors and thus be traded less often. But in looking through the historical volumes of both, except for at the beginning when $GOOG was first created, their trading volumes seem to largely be the same. I unfortunately don’t have access to data for options trading volume between the two, but I imagine as derivatives, they would follow in line with the movements of their respective stocks.

It’s interesting to note as well that it’s only in the last one or two years or so, that the price inversion between $GOOGL and $GOOG has occurred. For the majority of time, $GOOG from it’s inception as a non-voting right share has generally always traded at a slight discount to the original $GOOGL with voting rights. Is this a potential indication of something that’s occurred within the last two years? I’ve looked through all the SEC filings of Alphabet during this time period, and at least with respect to the corporate structure of the company, nothing seems to have materially changed.ThanksMy buddy casually predicted that if the SpaceX rocket launch went off as expected today, TSLA would reach $1K or higher. I thought about it, and it actually made a bit of sense. Especially with all the new retail investors and their freshly opened brokerage accounts. Any thoughts on this? And has anyone done any analysis on the stock price and option chain action for TSLA following successful SpaceX operations or good SpaceX news generally?things that are weird about this industry is you're going to find that you will likely have to do that yourself.

1 - find what you are relatively better / best at and continue to work on that

2 - lol cant answer

3 - you should make these yourself imo.

4 - DONT STOP LEARNINGYes please!Too late to get in on this ... new to investing and sounds like awesome collectionSure. thanksyes please!could you pm me this as well plsHi would you mind sharing this with me as well please?Could you share this with me too ?Also too late to get in on this by any chance?you could probably figure this out by the difference between P/E expansion (including that stuff, aka below the line) and EV/EBITDA expansion. If its the same multiple expansion its probably doesn't account for muchWow, hadn’t thought about that, this is very interestingROE = ROA x Leverage (Assets / Equity) 

you can buy back your shares at market price and it is subtracted from equity. This can create some interesting distortions as some companies that have been long time share repurchasers have negative equity. What does that do to ROE? #ref

I think its directionally correct but this is a good statement.What's the best measure to look at? I always look first at ROCE but that gets a fraction of the search results vs ROE.Delisted from an index? As in removed from an index, or delisted from an exchange?Hmm this question is always hard to answer.

For me I personally get sense of things when I read about all the companies and try to approach it like finishing a puzzle. The outer edge is easy (getting the info + SS reports + ARs), but starting to make progress is hard. My personal method is just read as much as I can and then the pieces start to make sense to me in my head. Whenever there is a term or a company I don't know - google. Slowly it comes together. Most of the time i just look at numbers after that and move on.

If you're having to init / present - i would make an industry "landscape". Value chain up and down the sector, w/ linkages from the 10K of customers / suppliers. GoodluckI’ve found that listening to or reading the most recent earnings call is really great at figuring out the KPIs for a given company or industry. Usually in the prepared remarks, management will mention the KPIs that matter to them and investors. The questions from the sell-side can be hit or miss since you have to wade through the softball Qs but they often also have data points that investors will care about for a given company or industry.Maybe maybe not on the dcf thing. I want it to be utterly clear that Buffett is a math savant when it comes to discounting. Like you don’t have to think about adding 5+9, he probably does not think when he does valuation.There’s this little thing called debtThey have to many assets to go bankrupt, it also benefits no one if they do. 

Click bait headlines are what say bankrupt and airline in the same sentence.A lot of it is very general and basic. If you’re in equity research already, skip it. If you’re a college student or in Pwm it might make sense but it’s so basic. Even margin of safety is basic. The series exams and cfa honestly cover more stuff.When you say official announcements, do you mean filings? Couldn't you subscribe to the RSS feed in EDGAR or on the company's IR page?I've usually gotten at least a token response back if I sent a write-up.I got a job from a cold email ! Didn’t prepare anything really but just was genuinely curious to learn more and he noticed that. Pure fluke and right place right time thoughYep, multiple interviews and internships that lead to ft roles (plus another offer) from both buy and sell side from cold emails. Best practice imo is to send reports relevant to the fund - I've had great success with this. Best in mind that these reports are 20+ pages long. 

The other thing you can do of course is reach out via LinkedIn and express interest in their fund and ask to  meet to learn more about them etc.

Met a recruiter who said that he knew a kid who once interned with 4 of the top 20 or so fundies by sending relevant research reports to PM's.It can happen for a whole number of reasons but an easy straightforward one is that just because the price is low, doesn't necessarily mean that insiders always have liquidity on hand. People always have all sorts of plans for their savings and buying back stock in your company is not always at the top of the list.[deleted]Some of the smaller ones report end market exposureJust to continue the discussion. The following link says Buffett isn't concerned with supply and demand intricacies:

Not sure if it's fully accurate but if so, how does he find bargains if supply and demand drives business fundamentals? The only way I can imagine him doing so is if he finds opportunities that are like net-nets. But he's got too much capital to do that.look at the 10 and search the word covenants. 

if not you're going to find the 8-k that announced the cov and search the word covenants. You will eventually find a document that refers to it directly.Could run cf on bbgIt's not necessary.

I recently read Guy Spier's book, where he mentions how he implemented certain behaviours to avoid distractions and irrationality in his investing. This included

\- Only checking prices once a week/month

\- Only setting orders when the market is closed, so as to not be influenced by the price move of the day

\- Setting up his office such that he has to stand to use his Bloomberg terminal, and so he doesn't risk getting distracted and spending too much time using it

\- Moving away from New York

Reading this helped me personally to reflect on how the day-to-day news and moves in the stock market affects me and brings out my irrational self. As silly as it sounds, I think that seeing daily price moves in stocks can be emotionally tiring, and certainly distracting. So I decided to try to limit the frequency at which I look at stock prices, and instead focus on learning about how to invest, and researching companies.

By doing this, you might miss out on the "best" price to buy a stock, but as a long term investor, does it really matter if you could have bought a stock a few percentage points lower?

And I leave you with a quote that resonated with me:

"I accept my fallibility. Instead of pretending to be perfectly rational, I find it more helpful to be honest with myself about my irrationality. At least then I can take practical steps that help me to manage my irrational self" - Guy Spier* Channel stuffing.
   * Very high revenue growth and high operating margins.
   * Low deferred revenue and high accounts receivables.Almost impossible to truly know. There is a broad statement that things on the infrastructure side tend to make very little money or be abstracted away, while things at the application / business model level make tons of money.

A good case in point is the rise of open source software OSS. Most of the large tech companies use and maintain large OSS libraries. Even microsoft - the historical anti OSS now has open sourced typescript, vscode, parts of bing's algorithm etc. Facebook made GraphQL / React, 2 huge and important tech. Even programming languages like Google's GO is open source!

Almost always the value seems to be in analyzing the end markets not the tech itself to a certain extent. Knowing what the tool is and why its important is one thing, the job it gets done is what brings value.what?In the end, all I care about is getting my return percentage.  

Longer example of this is Alcoa:

 "In 1886, [Charles Martin Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Martin_Hall), a graduate of [Oberlin College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberlin_College), discovered the process of [smelting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smelting) aluminium, almost simultaneously with [Paul Héroult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_H%C3%A9roult) in France. He realized that by passing an electric current through a bath of [cryolite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryolite) and [aluminium oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_oxide), the then semi-rare metal aluminium remained as a byproduct. This discovery, now called the [Hall–Héroult process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall%E2%80%93H%C3%A9roult_process), is still the only process used to make aluminium (however, see also [Bayer process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_process)).  "

So that's an intangible asset, right?  How much would you pay for that intangible asset in 1886?  Would you think the processing plant is the important part of Alcoa, or his secret recipe of smelting?  So, in a sense, if you paid $1 for that recipe in 1886, you would have $1 of goodwill on your books (roughly).

If you have a company that has $500 bil in cash and it generates $50bil, I would look to where that money came from...I know that interest rates are about 1%, so that's $5 bil of the return, so they are generating $45bil somewhere else.  If I paid $500bil now, I would own the whole company, could pay myself back $500bil immediately, and then still get $45 bil somehow.  That's a really good definition of an absolutely fantastic deal.  And that was roughly apple at around $125 per share.I think that, every time you see the word EBITDA, you should substitute the words "bullshit earnings.”

 Charlie MungerPeople tend to sell indiscriminately during times like these regardless of fundamentals and I do not think much thought is being put into the operational details.I'm not really in the bond world, but I've had some experience using the Reuters Eikon platform. I also looked at the other platforms.

They are all pretty expensive. I think the cheapest is a few thousand a year.

There is one resource that is free, though, and is great. That is the FINRA database that is run by Morningstar. Check out this example... it gives you the prospectus, price history, the credit ratings, and a lot of other basic data that you would find on a platform like Eikon.

[https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/BondCenter/BondDetail.jsp?ticker=C512573&symbol=SPG.KS](https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/BondCenter/BondDetail.jsp?ticker=C512573&symbol=SPG.KS)If you can get access to Rating Agency (Moody’s, S&P, Fitch) reports - that can help with bond valuations too. Unlike equity investors, bond investors favor stability in the business to pay off the interest and principal. Rating agencies look at the riskiness of the business decisions the management makes and grade bonds and corporates on relative stability.For small private investments I’ve done thisI have been using it for a couple of months now.

You'll get a good gauge of whether you are actually good at macro bets if you can do it consistently.It’s a cash outlay that will (hopefully) result in future revenue growth. Thus, model in both based on your expectations. 

You would only “add it back” for valuation if you believed it was a one time cost or it was expected to decrease. I’ve never seen a company like this, but maybe there are some exceptions like an early stage biotech.>Do you add R&D back into operating profit, do you leave it out...what do you do with it because it's a cash outlay that the company has to do for future growth but what do you do with it in terms of valuation because I'm so lost.

You can capitalize the expenses and then amortize it kind of like PPE. You'll have to come up with a way to amortize it. I would keep it simple and amortize it straight-line. Then the only thing you have to figure out is how many years to amortize. 

In this way, you add the R&D expenses back but then you subtract out the amortization.Book value is generally appropriate but I would say the first thing you need to do before applying any ratios is making sure you have a good understanding of what the banks assets and liabilities are. Book value doesn't mean much if you do not know what the bank is holding, who they are lending to and whether its quality.The first one is more precise. If you just take the CFO from a 10-k's balance sheet it has a lot of noise, like changes in deferred tax assets/liabilities...these may cause CFO to move around a lot but not reflect the true run rate FCF. But if there isn't a lot of noise, the first and second should be similar.

I recommend looking at both and if there's a difference, ask why. Then you have bases covered.First looks like they add in tax effect *(1-t). I think this will depend on your discount you use for cash flows. You won’t want to discount this formula by WACC since WACC includes tax shielding effect on outstanding debt in the discount. Bottom formula I have used primarily and have discounted with WACC. 

Prob depends on how you assign risk to a cash flow and the entity’s capital structureLooking at ERI/CZR, I have no idea what happens when the initial purchase price parameters are this far off from the current parameters. Is the total price of $17B the offer, or the $7.4B in cash + 77m ERI shares the offer?

If the $17B is the offer, how is ERI gonna meet that with their share price?

If the $7.4B cash + 77m ERI shares is the offer, you're getting CZR for \~$8.3B, half of the initial in the span of a month.

Also in the termination rights, it doesn't say that ERI will get penalized if they walk away from the deal because they want to reneg the initial offer. It just says if they don't handle the antitrust stuff in time, they'll have to pay the fee. I am just going of the 10-Ks so I don't really know what's gonna happen if they do decide not to continue with the transaction

If anyone has experience with this kind of situation, please doIn M&A’s documents there is often a clause called force majeure provision that can halt the process. Anyway this provision does not operate automatically under US/UK law.I'm not an expert, but I did used to do M&A as a jr banker. It depends on how well the merger agreement was written. If the language is airtight, then a court can force the buyer to complete the deal.

Don't buy arbs because the spreads are large UNLESS you are a sophisticated merger investor. You may actually see Buffett start to do this with spare cash but he of course knows what he's doing. Although in this market, he probably has a lot to do with his cash.Mcd has negative equity cause of high treasury stock.  In fact, companies have negative equity have outperformed the market recently.>had negative equity at the end of last year?  And why are they not bankrupt?

Cause liabilities are not due yet. Let say i owe someone $1 mil due in 5 years. I carry it on my balance sheet but i am not bankrupt for until i am not able to pay it (in 5 years). Though sometimes banks can demand it faster if companies financial strength declines

>And since they clearly can generate profit, why is there no equity?

most likely they have balances from previous years. Balance sheet is like sum of all previous income statements.kind of outmoded w/ share repos, i think net debt / ebitda is the better lev metric

then look at current ratio + cash and debt maturities for liquidityalso check interest coverage ratio for ability to pay back debts. And CFO/ total debt too.Not exactly on compensation and motivation, but still best book on CEO topic i read is "The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional CEOs..."

Highly recommend if you didn't read it.Anyone's guess man, it's too early to tell what the fallout from this recession will be.Google CROIC. it's similar to your thought. i don't think it's necessary thoughThe way I see it, the company only needs $1000 in equity per share to generate earnings of $200. If the management is not able to use the additional equity from earnings to generate higher earnings in the future, they should be returning the excess capital to the shareholders. It is a waste for the company to accumulate cash (or worse, unproductive assets) in the balance sheet, inflating equity, when they only need $1000 per share to generate the same earnings.

It is not necessarily wrong that the company cannot find good re-investment opportunities, but it would be wrong for the management to keep the capital within the company if that is the case. The ideal scenario here would be to distribute all the earnings that cannot be re-invested effectively. In that case, the ROE would still remain at 20%.2.2 trillion stimulus paying checks to individuals.  I am a bleeding heart liberal but to me, this gives you the ability to ask them to use that government check to pay the rent.  Since the checks might take a few weeks, you have a 3 month window to get the money.  This is just one dude's opinion but this is how it all seems to line up to me.The American economy has been awash with capital and liquidity, not only from the US but also internationally. This has had the effect of not only pushing up prices in the equity markets, but also made it easy for companies to receive venture capital and debt funding.

https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/sp-500-dividend-index-futures.html

This market is used primarily by options market makers to offset their dividend change risk exposure (a higher dividend implies a lower call premium, a higher put premium).

Speculators (=not natural hedged) are typically asking for a discount to take the other side of the trade.

As all future markets, future levels are more reflecting the state of today S&D on hedges than actual long term expectations.

Edit:typoWhat makes you say it's steeply undervalued? I'm not an expert on evaluating financial institutions (that gets a whole section of the CFA curriculum lol), but it would seem to me that low interest rates are an opportunity for a bank. Their cost of borrowing certainly goes down, while their customers' cost of borrowing does not necessarily go down. The spread they can charge may get bigger, or it might stay the same if they pass all their savings on to customers, but it should not get smaller.No, it's also from asset purchases which create money (this is what is called "printing money") and that money is used to buy securities. The newly printed money represents artificial demand for securites, which would have not existed otherwise. And when more of something is demanded, its price goes up.There is quite a bit on the subject:

Debt is an IOU. I give you this much, you pay me back later that amount plus some interests to compensate for the risk I'm taking. The FED printing money is a way of saying 'Calm down, you guys should trust us (the USD) and each other and we'll pay back what we owe after this is over'. 

The money printed provides liquidity, so that markets can function due to unexpected demand for short-term money. Say normally I make $5 and owe 3 guys $3 each, and I have the bank guarantee that they will provide me with $3 whenever I need as long as I pay $1 to them each year. Imagine what happens when my profits go to 0. The banks are mad because I did not pay them $1, same with the 3 debtors. Then everyone cuts off their funding, and unsurprisingly, everyone suffers.  

Eventually, the effects of the debts incurred will depend on productivity (GDP). If debts do not match with the required productivity, people start to lose faith that they will be paid back, which means they don't trust the government, the country, and its currency. This leads to inflation. On the other hand, lower productivity also implies lower economic activity, people stop producing and start saving instead of investing. This leads to deflation.

Whether a debt crisis comes out as an inflationary or deflationary one is difficult to answer due to differences in each situation and the various economic dynamics. I recommend reading Ray Dalio's work and the first part of his debt crisis book to understand this issue.

At the end of the day, it all comes down to trust.I don't think PE or IB necessarily offer a "better" training experience, it depends on the individual firm you end up working for. I work in valuation and transaction advisory, so I don't have a dog in this fight and I have never worked at either type of firm myself, for full disclosure. But the reputation is that the IBs will have you as a spreadsheet monkey for a couple years deep in the numbers, while PEs focus more on the operations of the portfolio companies and give you more insight into how the sausage is made, not just how much the sausage should cost. 

To your point about the future of PE, they have so much cash left to deploy and there is a growing interest in alternative assets as a class, so the industry is poised for growth in my opinion.Tough to do PE without an IB background at a bulge bracket or elite boutique. Most PE is about financial analysis and investing, not really operations unless you’re on the operations team (you wouldn’t be coming from finance then rather consulting or industry)Couple of my friends have gone the IB -> PE route so I can just mirror what they have said about the experience. With IB, there’s more of a structured learning program.Since they’ve trained hundreds of kids over the years, there’s a time tested way of training up analysts and should prove you in good stead if you wish to go on to PE later. With PE, you jump straight into the deep end: with the exception of one or two structured programs in the mega caps, they expect you to come in and know your stuff from the get go. There are no training wheels and there’s an expectation to learn extremely quickly and perform in a very short period of time. 

With regards to one or the other, I think you have to be realistic and understand that most PE firms don’t hire from uni and the few that do only hire 1 or 2 from the top Ivy League and elite unis. So my advice would be apply for both and ask this question only when you get an offer from both. 
Also PE will never become as “liquid” as public markets. That’s partly due to the nature of the asset class itself (very relationship driven and opaque) and due to demands of its clientele (believe it or not institutional PE Lps actually want the illiquidity and its associated reporting benefits).You should focus on what makes you money and not how other people are managing their portfolios. If your are being disciplined and getting good returns in OTC markets then keep doing that, there's many ways to skin a cat.What’s OTC and IMOPick any company whose business model you already understand, a restaurant or retailer.Costco. There are a lot of case studies on the company and smaller pool of direct competitors (Sams Club / BJs) for comparative analysis. From there you can branch out to Walmart, Target, etc.A company with a single revenue source, publicly traded stock and bonds, and preferably on a growth or steady state trajectory would be easiest. As mentioned retailers are good, so are utilities. Don’t dabble with tech in the early days - or businesses with complicated balance sheets like autos, airlines or real estate companies. Also try and work on something that only sells in the US.It depends on what the competition is like at the distributor level. Are the distributors in a highly competitive environment with a lot of other distributors who can undercut them? They would not be able to keep the cost savings in that case. If not, the distributors could keep their prices high even if costs go down.Financial Shenanigans by SchilitWhat do you mean by shenanigans? I'm sure that many companies will take this opportunity to clean up their balance sheets, but there's nothing wrong with that per se. Mark Meldrum (CFA guy) talked about this in a video recently. It starts at 3:30 here:

https://youtu.be/7UxaXrFGT90I'd try to dig into what the adjustments are between non-gaap and gaap... these #s are going to be astoundingly bad so they will try to add back all kinds of costs as "one time" charges but you will need to determine that as an investor and decide what to give the company credit for, more importantly will be the guidance they put out and how they arrived at their assumptions, they will definitely be asked about that on their earnings call so pay attention to what management says about the company going fowardI can't even begin to imagine what non-gaap metrics like EBITDACovid and Adjusted FCF before covid kind of numbers we will start seeing. I can already see companies sharing operating cash flow on a working capital adjusted basis. I think the common theme is - look at all the things that go bad in a downturn like this - loss of earnings, change in working capital, credit losses, receivables impairments, lease adjustments - and make sure you track them on all the companies that you are analyzing.I believe there is a library in R that can do this. It feeds from the CRSP's database as its source. I've seen it done in a presentation but I don't remember the details.Yes, you can download it from Intrinio (for a price).

[Asness and AQR disagree.](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Perspectives/Is-Systematic-Value-Investing-Dead)

Personally, I think the easy money policies of the past few years (and past few months, especially) have distorted the markets to the point that growth is king and traditional value investing (buy cheap stocks of misunderstood companies) underperforms. However, value investing isn't just buying cheap stocks of misunderstood/temporarily downtrodden companies, it's also buying fairly-priced stocks of great companies, as Buffett preached. That seems to have worked fine, since that'd have you buying, for example, Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple while skipping Amazon and Tesla. 

If/when the Fed has to raise interest rates and people flee growth stocks, value should show its value once again.I think it’s dead not because there is something wrong with the strategy itself, but because it has become really hard to determine the intrinsic value of a lot of companies because of so many industries undergoing disruption. Once the Fourth Industrial Revolution / digital disruption has reached a steady-state, that’s when value investing will be a reliable strategy again. Value investing also works when the uncertainty is mostly at the security-level, not so much at the macro or at the broader industry level in terms of constant change in winners/losers. Right now there is too much volatility in macro and in how industries are changing, so what may seem like a winner company today may not be the case in a couple years (think how quickly Tik Tok overtook some other social media).I believe there is as I dabbled in Value Investing and was very disappointed in the results.  First, define "Value?"  Is it ExxonMobil in 2014 during the Oil Crash?  Or is it Microsoft during the 2000s before the new CEO came on board?

What I'm getting at is that Value includes too many companies that are on its final legs or hinge on one big bet.  Examples of crap disguised as Value can be found via The Acquirer's Multiple (not a fan but there are many fans out there of AM).Econ major, so I'll chip in with a couple cents. Right now, like you said we're currently in an asset bubble; however, such an asset bubble exists across multiple countries, especially developed/western ones, and thus that initself isn't necessarily something to worry about. It's a huge tangent to keep talking about, but I reccomend you read or look into Piketty's Capital if you can.

The major question I think you're asking is: what's the cause for this ludicrous discrepancy between the Economy and the market? There's many things really, but an ELI5 version consists of the following: a lack of current Economic info(it's one thing to be in an economic crisis and not realize it vs being in a crisis and then realizing it), the Fed actually doing their job and being proactive by dropping interest rates, a pro-business atmosphere by the Trump regime(and the corporate bailouts), and the consistent pumping of hope via vaccines. The reality is that, while everyone with a brain knows that the Economy is basically being held together by the Fed doing a damn good job(unlike 2008), efforts from the government have resulted in a pro-business atmosphere at the expense of the overall economy that's ultimately lead to the current bubble. The Fed "pumping money" is them doing their job in trying to sustain demand; recessions result in "deflationary spirals", which ultimately lead to a disastrous decline in productivity. Fiscally, the government is doing a poor job IMO.

In developed countries, you're bound to get an asset bubble, as its a natural consequence of a healthy economy. However, sustaining such a bubble will have disastrous consequences down the road; the question is, where, when, and how. To that, nobody knows as we(or atleast I) lack information.Reason why the s&p is staying at an elevated PE rations is due to flush of liquidity hovering around the financial system.Although P/E is ubiquitous, it's difficult to get meaning from that number without context. 


&nbsp;


A more intuitive way to look at why valuations sit where they are is earnings yield / free cash flow yield (inverse the metric). All it is, is opportunity cost. This asset yields X and has A risk, whereas this asset yields Y and has B risk. When the opportunity cost of holding the S&P 500 increases (fixed income rates increase), you expect to see earnings yields on stocks go up (P/E go down), and vice versa. To get a little deeper, it's ultimately supply and demand of investors which produce the prices you see in the market, and the participants' decisions are based on their opportunity cost. Read up on market theories if you want a full understanding.

Hope that makes sense.1. This is low-key fucked up banking on the death of a CEO

2. Google HIPPA lawsYes, book value is the same as equity.

Equity / shares outstanding would be book value per share.Here is just a point of clarification. Sorry if it is unnecessary. The book value of equity is the difference between a firm's balance sheet assets and liabilities. The market value of equity is determined by the stock price multiplied by shares outstanding.china ain't going to work, so they ain't shipping crap to us to buy.  means our consumer economy is going to go into the crap hole.  Fed gonna cut rate 2-3 times to try and unleash a wave of refi's when the companies can't pay their debt, and the banks are going to extend and pretend on the loans.  Then they are probably gonna try a whole bunch of stimulation that isn't going to work.

Problem here is that ain't gonna fix nothing because the inflation should shoot through the goddamn roof because how much you gonna pay for toilet paper when they ran out of it and there's only one roll left.  

So, if the China side don't clear up and they start shipping crap again, then we gonna be all fuxxored with inflation AND stagnant demand...so stagflation.  Which brings us to Oil and the 1970s, and Paul Volker in the 80s.  

This is my opinion.1) the price is boosted up by over buying or speculation of increased earnings

2) earnings are low due to one time charges or business setback

3) cyclical natureWell, that's an equation you are looking at there, right?  Even if I don't know what the P and E stand for, I know the P is on top, and the E is on bottom.  

So, if the P gets larger and the E stays the same, the ratio would go up.  If the P stays the same and the E gets smaller, the ratio goes up.  If the P and the E go up, but the P goes up faster, then the P/E will get larger.

Now, if I was looking at a company and the P/E was really high, they would be 'kitchen sinking' all of their bad write offs into one period, like with a CEO switch, he tanks the first quarter so he could outperform the next year and hit his bonus.  E would go down, P would probably go down also, just not as fast as the E.

Next, if there's a lot of hype and good talk about a company, the P could go up while the E could stay the same.  So, folks loved a good blockchain story, a good pot story, a good oxygen tank story, a good Olli story...more demand drove the price up.

Lower interest rates could drive the P up, people could borrow more money to increase the P while the E stayed the same.  Think 10 year bonds at 1% and an SP500 return at 2%.  

Mandated buying at 'all costs' would drive the P up, like an unsupervised buyback plan with no price caps, that would increase demand.  Think all share holder buybacks.

Shares at an IPO....lots of marketing, lots of promotion, limited supply, high demand.  Drives up the P, does nothing to the E.

Good ol pump and dump scheemes.  Company hires a wolf of wallstreet to promote the stock, they drive up demand, increases the P, does nothing for the E.

Stupid arbitrage plays from foreign governments.  Say the swiss pension fund thinks their country sucks and they spend a few billion driving up the price of ATT with money they printed from their own reserves?  Drives the P up, does nothing to the E.

Investor psychology, no downturns for 10 years.  Everyone thinks making money is easy so they auto pay for stocks instead of shopping.  Drives P up, does nothing for the E.

Also....... the company may be worth it because they are awesome and YOU think you are going to get a good bang for your buck, so you drive up the price.Define high. It's relative.Your "ROIC" calculation is inconsistent. You have a levered numerator (fcfe), but your denominator includes capital invested by debt AND equity investors. FCFF would be most appropriate for that calculation. However, using FCF(F/E) to assess performance isn't the best idea. It already includes growth spending on working capital and long term assets (acquisitions, pp&e, other intangibles).

Operating income (taxed/untaxed) is a more appropriate numerator for ROIC calculation. You might have to make other adjustments, though. Removing excess cash, considering whether or not to capitalize some operating expenses, for instance.i think FCFE is a better metric and what you're talking about is sometimes called CFROI ?Not anymoreIf you don't have bberg, factset, or anything like that then I would suggest alphasense (or Sentieo)...

Their position and intentions look very strong to me, so I’m either missing something too or the company is really deeply undervalued

I think BNP Paribas is another bank which is extremely undervalued, take a look at it and let me know what you think of it!I have it and I actually really enjoy it. I know a lot of people say to stay away because a lot of it is opinion pieces, but there is just SO MUCH information on there that it’s well worth the price in my opinion.

Buffett has invested in Goldman Sachs which is a professional services firm in a lot of ways (and a trading firm, and a lender, etc). 

I think (just guessing) Warren would say:

\-Likes: high margins, low capex, some opportunity for brand/moat

\-Dislikes: low scalability, maybe some risk of firm being too dependent on the talent

My understanding companies like AON are great businesses. Wouldn't be shocked to see him buy a company like that. But might be a conflict because he is such a big insurer...so might be impossible in reality.There's plenty of industries Buffett hasn't invested in. All he cares about it is whether he understands the industry and whether the price is right.

It looks like they have some bonds, and syndicated loans.I looked at this a while ago. In theory, it is pretty interesting because these stocks are kind of underfollowed. And there is a ton of private equity interest too: Premiership rugby in the UK, Six nations rugby in the UK, I think there is a rugby league in the US now, and people looking at a new golf league...fuck, I even saw private equity was getting involved in dog shows.

I think the general idea is that content is becoming more valuable as distribution costs fall away, most leagues are run by people who are basically incompetent, and sports rights have done very well over the past ten years. But it is definitely a complex investment.

For example, if you look at $MANU they have basically flatlined. Part of that is team performance but it is also scepticism about whether the EPL can continue to negotiate the huge rights packages...and this is partly due to the EPL being not very sophisticated about distribution and being too close to Sky.

And you also have to think about the structure of the league. The EPL is heavily unequal, a few big teams have all the money which is an advantage that is probably compounding with FFP (Man City just got banned from the UCL for 2 years because of these rules). But all the US sports are totally different and are basically guaranteed income (i.e. no promotion/relegation, big subsidies from local govt, draft systems, salary caps). And if you want to own a league (like F1), you also have to think about this issue of sustainability for teams...in F1, teams are burning cash to compete (as in the EPL), this creates a tricky situation for the league...you need the bad teams to make up the numbers, you want it to be competitive but teams are now blaming Liberty.

Another big issue is that you are often a minority holder. For example, with Juventus the Agnellis own a big chunk and that is great because they subsidise the company (and your minority holding) through Fiat but if they decide to go another way, you are fucked.

So it is definitely an interesting area but I would be cautious. I know some value-ish guys have gone "all-in" on Man U (there are tons of listed football clubs, even stuff like Arsenal/Celtic that trades on alternative markets) but the sport has a reputation for chewing people up. You definitely need to understand the structure...but, unf, nothing else looks that cheap.you could look up equity research on MSG, MANUAlso check out the twitter user and blog called The Swiss Ramble.

The company’s financials that you are using will likely operate on the ‘going concern’ assumption of accounting. You would discount cash flows at this point with your appropriate discount rate taking into account possible insolvency. 

If it is a distressed company then a ‘net realizable value’ would be used. If this is the case then you would be able to take a WAG and use tangible book value but you should also prob assign an increased allowance for certain receivables (not easy if you don’t have access to a company’s books). At this point you would add up balance sheet with these assumptions and see what assets could be sold for. If this is greater than above cash flows, company may go bust or be able to reorganize/renegotiate debt and remain.hes talking about return on tangible invested capital.ehhh...try to just have someone send you a copy. Or split the cost. I don't love it.I think software development costs should be counted like capex. Someone can call me an idiot if I'm wrong.

I think the only reason it's not counted as capex is accounting rules.Leveraged FCF = net income + D&A - capex +/- change in working capital

So yes, leveraged FCF is after you service debt (interest expense) but does NOT include paying down debt tranches. Net income is inclusive of interest, taxes, but not pay downs of debt.

&#x200B;

There is also unleveraged FCF which is useful because it's capital structure neutral. You'd look at this for like an lbo analysisno, you only lose more if you use debt"I understand discounting the cash flow growth by my personal cost of capital (so if I borrow at 5% and lend at 10% my return would be 5%)"

it's a different approach here. What is meant by discounting is that money in future are less valuable then if you have them now. Why? Cause you could've invested them.

For example let say you can invest money safely in your bank account with at 8% yearly return.

And you friend comes to you and says that he will give you $100 in a 2 years. What's the value of this $100 for you **now**?

It's $85.74 Cause if you have $85.74 now you could've put them in bank for 8% and you will have exactly $100 in 2 years. (85.74\*1.08\*1.08 = $100)>This means that theoretically they are out of cash, so, why aren't they?

nope. Liabilities is $ they owe, but they don't have to pay them right now. Also when time comes they can try to refinance them.

It’s paying for the company without paying for the debt, EV will add the debt on to represent the fact you’re also taking on that liability in the business and have to pay for it. Look at Ford, you could take FCF and call it a great return on Market Cap, but they have over 100B in debt despite having a 17B market cap. EV will show you that, it’s a fair comparison. Otherwise you’re paying for cash flow that acts as if it doesn’t have to pay for debt. That’s what I get out of it and I’m sure there’s a formal way of putting it, I’m not a finance major or anything. So adding it onto the market cap shows it IS something you have to pay back, leaving it out would mean you are acting as if it’s not there.Try returns on reinvested capital.Not sure this is of any help but in security analysis grahm described it by its title. If it doesn't occur regularly ans happened only once or twice it's non-recurring. For example the selling of a business that produced a bunch of income.

Unless the business has regular earnings from buying and selling businesses, it's not regular.What is the difference between the two companies if you are assuming everything about them is equal?Not really.

Cash inflows = CFOs
Minus Caprx that’s FCF. Minus dividend and share repo that’s how much is paid. Plus or minus debt payments that’s including financing. Then the rest is either changes in investment balances, changes in stuff like tax liabilities for equity issuance, or usually small balance sheet items that rarely are material. Makes it make more sense to me.If the numerator refers to the equity then you use FCFE in the denominator. If the numerator refers to the company’s entire capital structure, use FCFF.

Chuck Akre is my recommendation.OK, I was able to answer A myself.  The company in question has negative capital surplus, whatever that means?  I guess it means they bought back a lot of their stock using debt?  and since the stock doesn't go as an asset, this line has to also go into the equity section?  Is that correct?  Is this company screwed?  The way I see it, they now have negative equity.Main difference I can think of is that (1) normally is done to the benefit of existing shareholders while (2) is done to the benefit of both existing and potential shareholders. And also with the bonus issue, face value stays the same.>TLT

Correct me if I am wrong but do you mean you are trying to time the market to get the best bucks from your allocation? Aka trend investing? Like if equity etfs is cheap and bond etfs is expensive you go 90/10, then when the trend starts reversing you go 75/25 to exit expensive equity and go to cheap bond etfs? And you wish to know what are the factors that will make equity/bond go cheap/expensive and you want to time that?   


ETFs are just the same as normal security analysis.

If you could help it, don't value it @ the 10th year, 5 years should suffice. Cost of capital is only meaningful if you have alternative projects/investments to refer to. In your case the CoC would discount your DCF by a huge range (due to long years) so your valuation could be far out or far under, would recommend to take expected highest and lowest CoC and middle, once you have it average the 3 results and you will have a better approximately value. Ultimately, it depends on how well you understand that company prospects better than the others and build your own valuation from there.Valuation in the broadest sense means to value something, you could be a property valuer, so your "valuation" in that context will be to value the worth of property using comparable or other methods. If you are handling the finance side of a certain construction/build type projects, you will perform "valuation" on the project itself whether it will be yield positively. So valuation is a broad terms depending on what context you are speaking, but usually the discussion of "valuation" between a stock guy and another stock guy is generally refer to security analysis.   


Security could be debt-based or equity-based, and also be private or public, but generally speaking "security analysis" = "public securities analysis" aka "analysing the worth of the equity portion, the stock, which is being traded publicly in stock exchange".I don't know and I don't think it matters as there's enough overlap between the two things.

Yes, technically speaking inverse ETFs (usually built around indices or certain sectors) is counted as "short" position but without the need for margin account.

For instance company A issues 1 billion in 30 year bonds, while company B gets a 1 billion loan from a bank due in 5 years. 

Company B's immediate earnings would look worse (right?) bc their debt repayment would be much higher per year. But, P/E wouldn't capture the fact that company B would see a huge jump in earnings once their 5 year term is over while company A's earnings will be smoother throughout the entirety of the 30 years. 

Idk, I haven't dug too much into it. So not completely sure how debt repayment exactly factors into earnings. Would love of others more experienced chimed in.Yeah, they get assigned automatically.What’s P/B?The company has to pay the American corporate tax.It is common but that’s a big problemLooks like assets to obligations sits at almost 92% for all companies ([per investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pbo.asp)).

You could include the deficit as a liability in your analysis. 

It probably isn't a total deal breaker if the company's balance sheet is otherwise healthy.

I am surprised though. What is the requirement by law. I imagine the government requires companies to prove they can meet future obligations. There must be some thresholdI generally prefer to have everything on one tab, but then again, I'm rarely building overly complicated models in which I need to forecast every single item.

Afterall, a company that issues debt or takes out a loan likely expects to make a return greater than the cost of the debt. As an equity holder, you're entitled to that extra bit of return.In addition to the comments below, keep in mind that Mr. Buffet has made many investments in debt. He has done very well as a lender of last resort to companies in distress. I’m guessing the comments you’re referring to are meant to imply that USUALLY equity investments compound higher annual returns... sometimes a debt instrument can generate equity-like returns with less riskCoupon payments are fixed, you will never get more than the interest rate. Earnings as a percentage of equity are generally much higher than interest rates. Around 5% would be an acceptable return on debt, but companies can return 20% or more on their equity. 

Buffet's philosophy on compounding retained earnings is that if a company reinvests its earnings (instead of paying them out to shareholders), it will be worth more over the long run than a company that pays out earnings as dividends.Jack has $1.27 billion long term debt financing total assets of $960 million. They’ve been repurchasing a ton of shares, as evidenced by treasury stock at cost of $2.7 billion! Last fiscal year they repurchased $140 million of shares when their net income was only $90 million. FCF (Operating cash flow - capex) was $120 million. So the share repurchases alone are quite bold.Use  the median or harmonic mean of their closest competitors' capital structures.

I would look at the acid test ratio (current assets - inventories)/(current liabilities) to understand if the company has enough liquidity to cover its current liabilities.

If not, if the company is good you can try to check its ability to raise more cash in the short-termIt doesn't look good. Of their current assets 9B is inventory which I'm going to discount entirely (if they start selling inventory to pay debt shit has really hit the fan). That gives them a gap of 19B they'll have to cover. Their operating income in 2019 was 4.8B. I don't see how they pay off their liabilities without taking on even more debt.

I would dig into their 10K to see if there's anything of note in there though, I just briefly skimmed their yahoo finance page.They’re an essential business, I think they’re be able to sell inventory at a mark up. 

Also current liabilities also include credit facilities and financing sources that expire. I think they’re fine. You can’t just look at bro’s categories like that you have to dig deeper.Means nothing without understanding the business and industry.No, it does not mean it is a bargain.It can be a value trap, and there are a lot of them out there.You need to consider the following:

\* Which assets company has on the balance sheet? There could be a lot of intangible assets, goodwill or fixed assets that can not be liquidated at book value

* There could be receivables that company will never  receive (.e.g. customer that owns money is in bankruptcy)
* There can be inventories, that are very hard to sell in current environment
* The company may have a good balance sheet but be absolutely unprofitable (this is a case  with many small pharma companies). Sooner or later it will burn the cash.
* Finally all the information presented in the balance sheet can be fake.

&#x200B;

However, If you find a company that:

* Has more cash than market price and liabilities together
* Generates profit (preferably stable)
* You can really trust information on the balance sheet
* Has honest management 

You can conclude that this is a bargain. But such situations do not exist in normal market environment in US stock market.

One can find them:

* During panic massive sell off 
* In foreign markets (but foreign markets are less regulated, and therefore there are more frauds + currency risks must be considered)

Please let me know if interested.Hi, would like to look into some opportunities in the small cap space and bounce ideas. Let's connectAll the lines that have two possibilities (like when it says "costs/revenues") have a (+/-) or (-/+) at the end. My guess is that the sign of the figure in that line corresponds to whether it is a cost or a revenue. In this case, there is a distinction between revenues to be collected, and charges to be collected. So when it says 

"Other insurance revenues/charges to be collected (-/+)"

the (-/+) indicates that if the line is negative, it is revenues to be collected, and if the line is positive, it is charges to be collected. Here the line is positive so it is charges. And by that I understand that these are payables outstanding. However I have to say that "charges to be collected" certainly is a confusing term.>Just my 2 cents: if an end of the quarantine was announced tomorrow - would everyone immediately start flying again?

But that doesn't mean you should always use market values.

Market values are appropriate for the cost of capital because capital is raised from the market. But the book value of capital sources is appropriate for calculating return ratios (ROE, ROIC) because when you calculate return ratios, you are calculating the earnings a company was actually able to generate with some quantity of invested capital that was deployed in the past. For that, the actual historical book value is appropriate.Their investor relations page might have that information and would be a good place to start.

some companies just put this number as low as possible in unlikely case that there will be situation in future when they will need to sell stock so cheap.

APIC - is difference between real price paid and par value.

Look at Common Stock par value to see outstanding number of shares

And look at (APIC + Common Stock) /  outstanding number of shares to see real average what was paid.

"Does this difference have something to do with the country or exchange where shares are issued?" - no, unless some stock exchanges put limit how low you can go with par value.

TLDR  **ignore par value** and look at (common stock + APIC) as single number

p.s. there are situations when APIC is increased without increase in common stock.

Think about a supply and demand curve. If the firm wants to supply significantly more shares, given short term inflexibilty in the market, they have to accept that the marginal buyers will have lower valuations than the currnet market price. In normal market conditions, I sell to someone only a tiny amount down the demand curve from current market prices  


In addition to this however, raising equity is seen as a signal that something is wrong with a firm. Why? because it suggests either than the firm can't raise debt (so more risk of bankruptcy) OR that they think their own equity is overvalued.  


Finally, we are in a panicky market where people are getting margin called and liquidity is thin. So the discount required to move a significant number of shares is higher than usual.You will want to look at the loan agreements and see what the covenants are. There may be special definitions.

Oil/mining is tricky because seemingly healthy companies can be forced to declare bankruptcy in a surprising way, if you look at them like traditional companies. These companies also have to maintain large surety bonds and asset retirement obligations, and those obligations are no joke.

Not sure if those are available. For Munger’s letters, look for Wesco annual reports/lettersThere are a few components to the question and I'll unpack them in pieces.

*What are the differences between loan (receivables) sales and ABS securitization?*

First, a semantic point that becomes important when we get to securitization, Loans from the perspective of a company are different than receivables. A company issuing a loan takes on liability in the form of debt to a lender. A receivable from the company's perspective represents an asset, an amount they are owed.

The company is able to monetize the receivable by selling it to another party, often at a discount for the immediate liquidity.

From here on I will assume the company is a bank or lending institution. Companies that sell widgets won't be issuing loans and selling them whereas a bank or lender will.

Now let's add the layer of securitization.

An ABS, asset-backed security, can be characterized as a basket of securities. The basket can comprise of anything really such as [credit card](https://www.cibc.com/en/about-cibc/investor-relations/debt-information/cards-ii-trust.html)s, [bank loans](https://www.naic.org/capital_markets_archive/primer_180821.pdf) (CLOs), mortgages (RMBS,MBS). All of which can be viewed as receivables from the perspective of a bank. The bank can make money in two ways, lend money out and wait until they're paid back or lend money out and sell the risk to someone else. The securitization process allows the bank to do the latter. The former, holding loans to maturity is often a poor use of the bank's balance sheet. This is because the purpose of a bank has evolved over time to be that of an intermediary and not an investor. There are certain situations where they will but I won't go over them here. Another caveat, I'm assuming large banking franchises, not sure how regional banks, coops, or credit unions operate.

*They both move assets off balance sheet. Loan sale seems a simpler (and shorter?) process than ABS esp. if there are existing buyers for the company that is selling?*

Receivable sales may be simpler and faster but the market it smaller. This type of sale is also known as [factoring](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/accounts-receivable-factoring/). This normally applies to widget making businesses.

From the perspective of a lender, this is a little different. Loans, credit card receivables, mortgages and etc from a bank are often warehoused on the relevant banking division's balance sheet until there are sufficient loans for it to be packaged into an ABS. The capital market division will take those loans, package them, and sell them off to an institutional investor (pensions, Fidelity Fixed Income Portfolios/ETFs/MutualFunds...etc). A sufficient size, for context, will be north of 150 million. Going to caveat this with large banking franchises, not sure how coops or smaller regional banks do it. I'd imagine they act as brokers for securitization divisions at the investment banks without a commercial lending business.

*What about other aspects? Price? Risks? Logistics? When is it good/bad for the company to use one vs. the other?*

This depends on the company, going back to the widget making businesses. I'd imagine if they have to factor receivables they're fully drawn on their credit lines and have very short term liabilities that cannot be met. It's also possible that the receivables are past due and the company prefers liquidity. A widget making business wouldn't really choose between one or the other. If they need to borrow they'll likely use their credit lines, and for longer-term go to their local bank and get a commercial loan. The bank will take the loan and securitize it for sale to an investor. This would all happen in the background and the widget company will be none the wiser.

A lender only chooses to sell the receivable if they can no longer package it for sale or have an expectation that recovery is going to be too troublesome. These are normally [debt collectors](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/15/magazine/bad-paper-debt-collector.html) or distressed debt investors.

*And is it fair to assume that if the lender sells/securitize most of its loan assets then effectively it becomes an originator and earn fees as such?*

yes. SoFi, what started as a student lending refinance company does this. They give students money to pay their existing student debt. From the perspective of the student, they are swapping on liability with another. The student now has a loan with SoFi as the lender. SoFi loses some money but creates a loan asset that sits on their balance sheet. Once there are enough loan assets they'll sell them to [Goldman Sachs](https://www.sofi.com/press/sofi-completes-960-2-million-student-loan-securitization/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=ab338b5b71c7e62481b9850518e1ec0e7acac1c6-1590097403-0-AR37iw_9lEGIOZgV5rJF9aw6Z8Lez11BgPJ4tpaQMeS6a8jmb3CkkOyZwxQaKf_R2VGZBqs_NRFSfpvHlgRiyJQ-e0oyS2oQcP4BY76sVKCsfcthFnXPYrU8LNFIvS75wM3TR2_pykzjG3mx6SyBcaMQalIZOqa3t_qLvhv1aaBV93KE9nwJX2_zVBtkty30gfn-VXzxvtX4urFG8TfdG5N_p5AsolLZnuPZlUO2LXM-hKHYJZ2uXvy3Zb3NBs7TzlFK6KF-s9hTleD1UUq9e2ns7EuhQ1Iuw6VcTsECFOitY_XkL16mB-DozlndB3F5pci4c1q_OhM-jXBYB_q9re4S6OnRw0U7Ulg8v0LvCeLM7UKvDpnHYUvdKkPkt6R0awFd49hKrCSEvppRvjV9LLcAbhTeKpYH90Xmz9OYC5jK) to Securitize and sell off to investors. Along the way, SoFi likely charges some origination fee or they'll take a spread on the interest they charge.  Don't quote me on this as I haven't spent the time to look into their business model. Then Goldman will charge an issuance fee on the securitization, this normally gets bundled into the principal payments of the ABS. Last time I looked it was about 3% in Canada, but don't quote me on this. If you look hard enough you should be able to find the issuing docs and they'll spell out the fees the investment bank charges.  


Another example is of Candian Tire and Scotiabank. Canadian Tire is a retailer that sells mainly home goods. They issue a branded credit card with much of the capital coming from a large Canadian bank (Scotiabank). They list the structure and update the business regularly in their [investor relations section](https://s22.q4cdn.com/405442328/files/doc_presentations/en/2019/Glacier-Investor-Presentation-September-2019.pdf). They show a flow diagram on page 18, where CT acts as the originator. The financing comes from Scotiabank, outline on page 16 where Scotiabank Capital Markets also benefits from the securitization fee later on.I typically look for pitchbooks or market monitors from investment banks that specialize in that particular subsector.

But you can purchase it for a few thousand dollars.  Or purchase just a few pages. There are companies that are brokers of the paper. I think i came across this idea reading Tim Ferris’s 4 hour week. I used it for dippers!!! It’s a powerful toolAs we've gone through a very long bull run since the great recession, we've seen stock prices rise to extraordinary levels. Value investing revolves around finding undervalued stocks and buying them at favorable prices. But when everything seems to be overvalued due to the bull run, naturally it is harder to find bargain stocks that value investors rely on. That's why some people call this strategy "obsolete". But in reality, this strategy is and never will be obsolete.Are you talking about a stock dividend in the sense that a company pays out a dividend?

Or are you referring to a dividend that is paid out in the form of more *shares* as opposed to *cash*? (see what OXY is doing with Buffett's preferred share dividends - paying with common stock)Basically the par value per share doesn’t change with a stock dividend, but does with a stock split. So for a company with $1 par per share, if they issued a stock dividend then the par per share wouldn’t increase but the aggregate Common Stock at par line item would increase due to the new shares issued. The money can’t just be made up though, so the additional paid in capital has to decrease by the same amount. So now you have the same total amount of common stock at par plus APIC, with new additional shares issued as dividends - effectively diluting the per share value through an increase in the denominator with the numerator kept the same.

If they issued a stock split, then they are literally splitting the par value per share in half while doubling the number of shares. APIC remains untouched. Common stock at par + APIC is the same total figure as in the above case, but this time with changing par per share instead of transferring value from APIC.

For anything longer, you'd probably need access to Bloomberg or Factset. If you are good with coding, you can pull the data from Yahoo Finance. Another option would be to reach out to a data marketplace like Intrinio. I know they sell EOD prices for stocks going back 50 years but I am not sure about the price.

What equations are you using?I recommend business strategy books that focus on value creation to understand models better.  Having more information doesn't necessarily improve decision making. There have been several studies of horse racing that when handicappers receive more information about the horses and riders, they become proportionately more confident even though they are no more likely to pick the winner.  In my opinion pattern recognition is a powerful tool and understanding (or developing a circle of competence around different) types of businesses or models is more powerful than digging very deep on a particular industry.Valuation by McKinsey is a good resource with the majority of what you need.

The difference between Cisco and GM/Compaq was due to product obsolescence cycles and also type of customers. Cisco iirc sold LAN and Ethernet communication products to business enterprises. These products required less consistent reinvestment pressures since companies often used the same Cisco products for decades without purchasing new product lines/ switching to other companies. Ironically this often meant that they were able to reinvest more meaningfully over the long term and create stickier product lines.

By extension of their products, GM and Compaq faced a short product life on their goods and were under pressure to reinvest over a shorter time period to retain market share. Greater pressure to constantly improve and reinvent your product line creates greater consequences if you aren’t able to achieve it.Those PSU's and RSU's are issued at fair value so there would be no difference to account for.

I will typically breakout growth contributions from both. Some companies will also breakout organic EBIT. I also keep track of the multiples management paid for targets. If the number is increasing (for similar assets) you can assume returns are falling. Tracking third party data can be helpful in determining the share and growth of the acquired business.

If it is large I'd include them, as in theory if the hedges are closed and translated over to the reporting currency they are real expenses.Is there a real world example this thought experiment is based on? Market value by its definition means the price at which something changes hands. So our hypothetical company's market cap would still be price x #shares outstanding. 

Post-transaction though, this company would have 0 shares outstanding.Let's think it through with a simple example...

Say a company has 1 future cash flow. It will make $100 in 1 year risk-free. Its balance sheet is $10 in cash and no other items. $110 is the entire scope of its value. It has 100 shares. Therefore, the value is (pretty much) $1.10 per share. 

It uses its $10 in cash to repurchase 20 shares, on a pro-rata basis, at $0.50 per share (nearly half of intrinsic value). 

After making this repurchase, its value is $100 and it now has 80 shares. The value per share is $1.25. 

The company used $10 and increased value per share by $0.15, tax free until shares are sold. What if they had instead paid a dividend? In that case, they would have paid $0.10 per share, taxable immediately (unless in a retirement account).

Does that make sense?It's probably not what you want to hear, but you got to make your own decision! The way I operate... If I have the slightest feeling it will keep me up at night, I don't do it. Regarding LEAPS specifically, remember the two rules Ben Graham/Buffett always said: 1) Never lose money, and 2) Never forget rule number one.

Assume company XYZ generated $4 in LTM EPS. Applying a 25x earnings multiple implies the stock is trading at $100. After five years (of 25% annual growth), it will generate $12.20 in EPS. If a 10x P/E multiple is applied, the stock is trading at $122. The return on XYZ  is 22% (4% annualized).

If you made this investment five years ago and your benchmark was the S&P 500, the stock was a poor investment. However, if compared to the FTSE 100, it generated positive outperformance (22% vs. -5%). Some managers are mandated by clients to stay within a certain type of investment.Mainly tells you how levered the company is.this is also what i am looking for.You have to simplify.

I'd be curious to know myself how it's been measured in studies to date. The conflict is inherent between long term interests of investors (shareholder wealth maximization) and the short term interests of management (quarterly/annual targets linked to compensation). 

The first thing that comes to my mind is to compare the long-term returns of companies that push those kinds of short-term performance bonuses to management versus those that don't. 

I had a professor in school who always cited a survey of CFOs in which the majority admitted they would not pursue positive NPV projects that would result in short-to-medium term underperformance in exchange for longer-term shareholder wealth maximization. That study might be a place to start. Hi all,

In the example you use above you have leverage of 2.5 times your capital. The point is that if your assets lose a dollar in value you have lost $2.50 in equity and vice versa.

Tech companies cannot be valued with DCF because 70% of the value is in the terminal value, which itself is highly sensitive to terminal growth and the discount rate. Now the terminal growth rate is the big unknown because the typical 2-3% that usually gets plugged in as terminal growth rate doesn’t apply to tech companies. The rate of change is so high in the industry that by year 10, the tech company has either failed and vanished (so 0 terminal value) or pivoted (so may have entered a new era of high growth for instance).

So what I like to do is I calc one terminal value with 10 years of cash flows and 0 terminal growth growth, and another with 20 yrs of cash flows and 0 terminal growth. I then take the average of the discounted terminal values and use that.  That’s if I want to DCF.

But because of this high uncertainty in the terminal growth, comps and transaction multiples are probably the way to go.https://vineyardholdings.wordpress.com/2020/05/19/checklist-investing/

A SPAC acquired a majority interest in a portfolio company of a PE firm I follow. The purchase was structured such that the PE firm retained some 30% of common equity with an earn out that would increase their stake subject to EBITDA/valuation hurdles. Seemed like good alignment. The company hit some hurdles and the PE firm (likely more interested in saving face with the lenders who they would do business with again than the SPAC investors) repaid a large portion of the bank debt by layering and diluting the common equity with expensive sub debt + warrants.I agree.

When you use that number to calculate the market cap you are essentially making an assumption that the non-listed shares can be bought for the same price as the listed ones.Less ambigous and/or trying to communicate with less sophisticated investors. Really tho you should only focus on OCF and free cash flow.I think Yahoo and Bloomberg have sorting by industry, but I'm not 100% sure.So many acronymsI'm surprised that guy is still in business, last spoke with him 4 years ago about Taste Holdings. His three biggest holdings (Trustco, Taste Holdings & Conduit Capital) have lost something like 90% of their value over the past few years.

And I believe RVP owns around 35% of Conduit.Like all businesses, the intrinsic value = discounted FCF. But due to the volatility in commodity prices (and input costs for steel) it is extremely difficult (in my opinion) to forecast cash flows with any accuracy.

My approach, with steel:

1. Always focus on current (spot) prices as a base.
2. But, try get an understanding of the commodities, and the current supply and demand dynamic, this is for the product (steel) and the inputs (iron ore, coal, etc).
3. Then assess these current prices and the margin the company can achieve. Use history and the spot price relative to the average cost of production, and the price required to incentive new production. This will give you a sense of a fair long term range.
4. Then think about the valuation at current prices/margins (EBITDA/tonne), and at prices within this range. I keep it simple: look at multiples: EV/EBTDA and FCF Yield (my focus). Consider the balance sheet, and remember multiples should be counter-cyclical. Often not the case = opportunity.
5. Finally, worth thinking about book value or replacement cost while considering the state of the balance sheet. If its a robust business, with a strong balance sheet and position, it should trade in excess of its replacement cost over time.

These are cyclical companies, and not of great quality (in terms of ROIC's etc.) Timing really is everything. Don't try catch the bottom. Wait for an indication of turning margins - such as the factors mentioned by accessoira.Supply and demand plays the major role in thal.It's not inflation. It's what the Fed is doing with the money they are printing. They are giving out loans to smaller firms and buying investment and high yield paper from companies. Any fundamentally good (and many bad) will be able to survive, despite the business fundamentals in the short-term due to what is going on.

The loan that was given to the company is on the asset side of balance sheet in some way already. Either they are holding the cash or have invested it in their net working capital or in their property plant and equipment. 

So to answer your question should these loans be  considered invested capital, the answer is yes. And under the equation above they already are counted as such for the reasons I gave.

Just one slight change, I keep the sell-side reports for the end to judge my understanding of the industry/business/numbers and cross-check what I overlooked/under-emphasized/overemphasized to gain a different perspective. Looking at the Sell-side report before diving deep, in my view clouds/prejudices my reasoning.  But I agree this method is not the fastest and takes more time and effort.kpi's are good to analyze a company but to play in the market, you also have to know the rules of the game. Every industry is a bit different. But if you go by GICS sectors you dont have so many to learn. For example I wouldn't use the same strategy on technology stocks and utilities. Technology is a lot about under priced growth. Utilities is relative value at the stock level and at the sector level is highly correlated with interest rates.KPIs are certainly helpful, but I guess I'm just having trouble adapting to the idiosyncratic nature of different names.

For example, take Philip Morris, given your username - to understand the company, you would need to know the ongoing FDA regulations (which there are many), changing unit economics and growth trajectory of each product line, etc. Obviously doing your research is a big part of investing, but I have just been finding it quite easy to get lost in the weeds trying to figure everything out.Right, but that's more talking about the speed at which he does it.

As a data scientist my work has become a lot more of how do I bring business value vs what is best model to use. I want to be sharper on my business value.Sorry was writing in a hurry should be clearer nowCorrect esp with apple example. 

Regarding intangibles, even though logically you would expect it to be worth more than its listed book or less given an overstatement, the counter argument is that this intangible asset likewise good mgmt shouldnt be double counted because it is what brings the current price for the product/service etc. You could state that the intangible does give it future pricing power/stability etc. 

However, the original question is if it logically makes sense to subtract tangible assets from the purchase price which i think it does because when you purchase a company, you are also receiving back the tangible assets which have value.  I guess what im trying to say is, does it make sense to essentially evaluate your purchase on the excess i.e. goodwill

Getting into intangible asset valuation is another topic i would love to discuss as well because most of the value of a company comes from the intangible assets imo.Think Charlie is kinda silly on this one.

Why do you feel it's not necessary or not the best approach?What happens if a company is operating at 0, or perhaps even negative equity, and then starts taking quarterly losses ?  more debt?  If the debt to equity ratio is infinity, how are we supposed to analyze these balance sheets?Yeah i agree with you on that, but my point is that ROE seems not appropriate metric to represent investor's return in this case. not on point of what company should do. Warren Buffett praised ROE as most important single metric. and i doubt it.Ok true, that fixes the residential problem a bit, but what about commercial real estate holders which have much larger payments and their businesses cant pay?I see thanks!Thanks!really cool.

how did they arrived at "9 years to recover from downturn"?
end of 2019 annual contract for SPXDIVAN (SDA) was 60.80,
on April 6, when the article was published it was 42.00 (lowest was 39.30 on April 2)

"The S&P 500 Dividend Points Index (Annual) (SPXDIVAN) tracks the accumulation of dividends on an annual basis and resets to zero after the expiration of the leading December contract?On the flip side all of the potential for interest rate change is bad for banks. I'm not saying that long duration risk free rates aren't going to go down, but there is little room for their balance sheet to benefit from interest rates and a lot of room for their balance sheets to get torn to shreds. I would think that banks would trade even cheaper than they did before rates went down because you have to have more protection against 6% 30 year rates now than you did before. IDK maybe it isn't a problem with the amount of securitization.For example I was looking at the historical Financial statements of Target and I noticed they started showing their Operating leases on the balance sheet over the past couple of year.

yes I am referring to the book from Schilit, basically I posted in a well known forum the same question, where people discuss a lot about technical analysis and most of them I reckon are swing traders, well I got two replies that say financials are not reliable at all, big company can do whatever they like. This is depressing for me, because I am interested in the game of the investing just because can have some fun reading the digits. Another reply highlighted the possibility to listen the investor relations questions because some of them can be really interesting. I heard the video from Meldrum while was doing other tasks, but it looks to me he does not explain too much about cooked books in Q3. But found nice he spoke about some indicator he was looking in the financials in Q2.cool, make sense, changing in evaluations should be the first signal and they should come from No GAAP, then I would dig into cash flow and then BS P&L, and definitelty I am going to learn from investor relationsyes really good measurements indeed, of course it depends by the field, now I have only NVDA, just for educational purposes, because need to focus and understand their business better than their CEO. I need to see how much of their income come from b2b, so to understand how many real retailers vs small ecommerce business they have, and do they concede prepay terms or give line of credit?
Then need to see how much of their current cash flow come instead from b2c, maybe they sell online via an ecom site. Working capital is a strange measure can be manipulated depending from interpretation and accruals, but if the receivables losses increase in the P&L they must justify this in the no gaap i guess,  I really need to know their last three years reports.[deleted]No offense taken.

>Free cash flow to the firm ("FCFF") does not include net borrowing - that's your first formula there.

are you sure about that?

Formula for FCFC is "FCFF= CFO + int(1-tax rate) – capex"

>Free cash flow to equity ("FCFE") always includes net borrowing

i agree with this, it's " FCFE = CFO + net borrowing – capex "

but as i understand for some reason net borrowing often omitted and  "FCFE= CFO - capex"  is used insteadI wish I had answers. Those are fair questions to ask but I wish I had answers. Would I personally short it? Probably not. Mainly because the company can pay off all of their debt tomorrow if they chose. They're not dead even so they're not playing revenue games to stave off bankruptcy. But "why should I short this now"? I don't have an answer.I never said I was short it. I'm not long it either. I was only bringing this up here because of what I foundThey do publish switching revenue and I have found number of transactions in supplementary materials. I am still unable to find their revenues split by geography (only GDV) and GDV for cross border transactions. Or do they include GDV for X-border in the GDV for individual regions?Thank you!The other commenter is correct, they state it themselves in their annual report and it was GMV rather than revenue. 

Their total GMV is 2.14 billion in 2019 and active customers in 2019 were 2,068,000. Meaning 20,000 customers accounted for GMV of 577 million or almost $30,000 in average. So I agree that this is potentially an important rabbit hole in projecting sales and growth for a few reasons.

1. These customers account for a big percent of sales and I'd wager their demand is very inelastic. I don't know anything about YNAP or if brands such as LVMH have such a dedicated online customer base of whales (something I will research, and hence the point of my post). The retailer that can earn the loyalty of these customers will have significant long term advantage as otherwise I'd argue all retailers are pedalling relatively commoditized products.

2. I haven't read 2020 Q1 release but I heard sales were up 90%. I would wager these 1% of customers will contribute a lot to sales growth this year as they likely still have purchasing power and their offline sales are probably cut 50-100% depending on the extent of store closures, so this demand is likely shifted online.

I haven't went and researched this further yet since my last post, but let me know if you have any insights :)They self-declared it as a risk factor in their 20-F, tho it's 27% of  "Digital Platform GMV" rather than revenue.Thanks for taking the time, man! btw Someone downvoted me so I guess this was indeed a stupid question. lol But I'm new to this and I don't think I can be too careful. It has to do with money after all.Like afroman highTyNice, i didnt know there was a term for it. Thanks.>Sentieo

What is your job at the company?I've never heard of it.  Looking at their website it seems they don't want to give a price which means I probably can't afford it. 

 I have a Fidelity brokerage account and read their research reports and stuff but I've found things like [stockrow.com](https://stockrow.com) and [finviz.com](https://finviz.com) much easier to get pertinent information from, and of course I've been reading a lot of 10-K/8-K and foreign equivalents on EDGAR.

What does the deposit facility rate refer to then?> BNP Paribas

I'm not familiar with them, which is surprising, given their size. At a glance, they do seem undervalued. One of my bigger hesitations with banks in general is that I'm not sure how they'll fare in the super low interest rate environment that we're in. With negative yielding bonds across Europe, and the US on the same trajectory, it seems bank earnings will take a hit.[deleted]Thanks. Any further comments? Is there a "right way" and a "wrong way"?

to be honest not all tech companies have software development in investing activities. Some put everything in R&D.

Edit: nevermind, I thought about it for a bit and I got it, thanks so much again!so how do you tell if a company will go bankrupt?Thanks! Are there any hedge fund letters you recommend I read through related to this asset class?Enterprise value is a representation of what it would cost you to buy the ENTIRE business. When buying a stock, you are only buying a part of the business since businesses are made up of debt and equity.

A simple way to think about it would be if you were to buy my wallet.

My wallet has a debit card with $500 available (assets) it has a credit card with a balance of $200 (debt) and I have a $100 bill in the wallet. How much does the "wallet cost"? 

Asset+debt-cash= Enterprise Value

$500+$200-$100=$600 enterprise value.How is this calculated? Is this different than ROIC?Let me rephrase my question. what i'm exactly curious is that if two companies have same ROE trend, does it necessarily means the two generates same cash flow? i know how accounting earning and cash flow is different but ROE considers invested capital.Thanks! It's starting to make sense. Can you expand upon this as well: "the rest is either changes in investment balances, changes in stuff like tax liabilities for equity issuance."So say the company has a bunch of FCF, and it uses some to pay down debt, pay a dividend, and buy back some shares, but there's still a bunch of cash leftover. Where does that cash "go"? Does it end up somewhere on the Balance Sheet? Also, is there any connection between that leftover cash and the Retained Earnings?thank youthank youthank you very much. I saw him on WealthTrack couple times .Do you have another example?

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality\_investing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_investing)Treasury stock is never an asset to begin with. It's a contra-equity account. What is the company in question and I can take a look.Thanks for the reply!

You're basically right with your understanding of my goal.  Although I want to emphasize the passive nature of what I'm hoping to accomplish.  For example, shifting my portfolio towards bonds/equities given some evidence that one side has become expensive/cheap is something that would occur passively, i.e., instead of re-weighing my portfolio by selling shares I currently own and buying shares I want, I would only change my buying strategy.  This would make my strategy much slower and less reactionary, so that it'd probably only be effective in long time ranges.  But I agree that ultimately it's like trend investing, just that the trends would need to be very macro.

I think this context is important since it kind of addresses your comment that normally ETFs are already diversified.  I agree, and hope to leverage this fact.  So, instead of trying to analyze any specific stock or industry, I'm looking at analyzing the US equity market as a whole and comparing it to the credit market as a whole.  This means that it's not very feasible and probably not very fruitful to analyze the underlying stocks comprising such ETFs (i.e., SPY).  For TLT, there's not even an underlying company to analyze since it's based on US treasury rates.

So, to me, it would seem what influences the price of ETFs like SPY or TLT is from global macroeconomic events rather than any particular company or even set of companies (to some degree), and I'd find more success in analyzing such events.  Obviously the most recent (and ongoing) example of such an event is this coronavirus situation.  The equity market took a major hit due to global events and government actions, while the Fed has been implementing economic actions which have obviously affected the credit market.

Now, obviously the pandemic is unprecedented and I don't think anyone, with typical information on these events, can properly "time" any of this and consistently take optimal actions in response to it.  But, at the same time, the various government actions can be analyzed themselves and give some clue into how the future will look, at least in longer ranges of time.

Which leads me back to my question: where's a good place to start in terms of analyzing such events and actions in terms of how the effect broad markets in general?  I can appreciate that I'll have significantly less control over my portfolio versus someone who focuses on individual companies, but I'm only trying to improve on a naive passive portfolio rather than trying to beat the markets or anything.  It basically comes down to understanding how macroeconomic events effect these markets in general, but that's a very broad question and I'm not sure where to even start.Thank you.not only am i trying to value the company at year 10 but more specifically i am trying to determine the cost of capital after year ten so indefinitely, but i see what you mean by taking the average of the three, but won't that kind of just converge on the middle cost of capital or simialr depending on your range?There are brokers that allow this in my country (UK).

When you say dig deeper where specifically do you mean? The notes on financial statements?Thank you. This is what I was thinking.

The stock I am looking at is HERTZ GLOBAL (HTZ).

From my understanding, (and I am a noob) the company has been FCF negative for the past years and has been losing money (net income negative). HTZ was a Carlyle buyout investment (2005-2013), which could possibly be a reason for its current situation.

Well known investors such as fairholme and icahn (\~30% of stock) have been buying up stock. Icahn long before the downturn (\~2014) and a bit more in the downturn. The company trades at $6/ share and has $6 cash/share. Moreover, the company is trading at a p/b ratio of 0.5.

Also, I have found that the company has a cost structure of \~25% fixed costs and 75% variable cost, giving it some flexibility in this downturn.

I have had trouble understanding how the company finances its money losing operations and what these investors see in the company, as there are other competitors such as AVIS which is FCF positive and, according to the company's managers, is able to face the current situation to the end of 2020 and a bit more. Moreover, AVIS' price has decline in a similar way to HTZ \~(-70%). However, AVIS has a D/E ratio of \~20x while HTZ \~9x.

The major risk/competition I have seen attributed to HTZ and AVIS is increasing competition from ride-sharing apps such as UBER/LYFT.

However (on a quick analysis), some of these companies rent cars to ride-hail operators such as LYFT and UBER - they are partners of UBER and LYFT not/ or not just competitors. Moreover, before UBER existed, companies such as HERTZ and AVIS were mostly focused on renting cars for leisure (i.e. long-distance rentals for tourists) not short-distance such as UBER/LYFT.

As HERTZ/AVIS mostly buy the cars they lease to customers, these new partnerships with UBER and others could potentially increase their economies of scale \[more bargaining power with suppliers (auto manufacturers)\]. Moreover, they have another difficult to replicate point which is that they have a global presence across different airports which is hard to replicate and partnerships with hotels etc...

Consequently, when the economy picks up again, it is unlikely that their competitive positioning will be completely eroded.

Thank youThanks!thank youThank you soo muchIf you do that, I strongly suggest you have a better rationale than "yields are stupidly low and have got to mean-revert eventually". I lost considerable money that way shorting Bund Futures (German 10Y)... (not sudden losses, but kept bleeding money while stubbornly rolling the contracts as yields became more and more negative).

Note that you also implicitly pay (or earn, if the yield curve is inverted) a carry cost roughly equal to the 10 Y interest rate minus the short-term interest rate (because short a 10Y and long cash is the physically replicating trade behind the short future). Additionally, assuming the yield curve stays the same while you're holding the contract, the underlying 10Y treasury "rolls down" the curve as it becomes a 9.75 Y treasury, causing additional losses for the short.

Just guessing, but rates might well remain very low for a long time, IMHO.ThanksWhere do i find the fee structure, is it the margin cost?so growth increases capacity of capital it can reinvest? so without growth company would have to distribute excess money?

If so, then why are fundamentals the dominant factors in stock prices, but not in real estate or gold?

Your ownership of the company’s operating cash flow is higher than the other case with high cash taxes.The reason I ask is because taking the Series 65 qualifies you for an RIA license, but to be an IAR requires being sponsored by a firm (if I understand it correctly).

If I just want to help manage stocks for friends and family, but have no plan to work for a firm, then doesn’t that make RIA the correct choice?Thank you so muchWhat are you talking about? I asked about 'total current liabilities', not total liabilities as you mention in your comment. Also, total current liabilities, and total liabilities are in hundreds of balance sheets I have seen.I'm looking at their most recent 10-K filing and they listed an EPS of $1.11. Am I missing something? I'm saying that I added back the special items and went through my roughshod math to get an adjusted EPS of $4.40, not that they did make that. I did back of the envelope math to get that $4.40.How many years forward? and do you have faith in your projections?Thanks not sure how I missed that I read Bloomberg daily.Thanks for the reply! I was calculating accounts receivable by 0.5 to be conservative. It’s nice to hear that big money is doing it my way. 

Good luck to ya, hope all your investments go to the moon.so IFRS ones has to be in english? once i was checking one french company and i could not find english annual report but meybe i missed it. Thank you for informationMany thanks for this detailed answer. Very helpful in clarifying the concepts and mechanics, much appreciated.

What about companies like large auto dealerships (e.g. CarMax) who originates used-car loans and finances some of them themselves and sell the rest to others (either via loan receivable sale or securitization)? In that context, I get the impression that it may be easier to first sell those loans directly before doing the securitization (maybe after having some track record to show), at least that seems to be how Carvana does it.

Anything particular changes in the situation above where the lender/originator is not a bank? Thanks again.Thanks for this!That was my thought as we. I assume those value stocks are just harder to find in the bunches of high P/E overpriced stocks, but nevertheless, if you find them, they should still theoretically rise to their intrinsic value. Do I have that right? Thanks for the clarification.Thanks. I may have to buy the data and screen for limited time ranges as you suggest. Appreciate the help.(Operating Income + Amortization of Intagibles)/ (Total Debt + Equity) for stocks

Super appreciative that you took the time to reply. I thought it was too specific of a question for someone to take the time, so seriously thank you.

If I correctly understood you, all this tells me is that this valuation method is flawed. The example you proposed with borrowing $1,000 makes sense because I BORROWED $1,000. So yes, I would essentially be losing money if my cost of capital was 10%, and that $1,000 returned me 0.3%. In other words, there exists an opportunity cost of earning 10% elsewhere, so that is equivalent to me destroying value.

However, the residual model is being used to value actual companies. I am not borrowing money to purchase their equity (book value). I agree that this the model would make sense if we lived in a world where the book value cannot be liquidated. Because in that case, the only thing that matters is what it is returning for me compared to my cost of capital. So even if a company had a trillion dollars in book value (but cannot be liquidated) that will return $3 next year, it's still only worth $30 to me because that's the return required to cover my cost of capital (10%), and that's the only thing I truly keep.

But that's not at all how it works in the real world. As a shareholder, you quite literally owner of a company's book value. If someone offered you a savings account with a trillion dollars that will return $3 next year for $30, would you take it? You obviously would, and so I still can't wrap my head around how this makes any sense. 

Thanks again. Looking forward to hearing what you think.Pretty good. TTM return of 72,2% with very modest leverage despite covid shenanigans. That said it's a very small amount of money and I haven't done this for long enough to see whether I can stay consistent long term.

Staying at my old job seems most convenient but on the other hand, learning the practical side directly from someone with many years of industry experience would be absolute gold. Not to mention fun. Do you work in the industry yourself?I'm working on reformatting the equity statement because I'm working on building some financial models. I'm confused because if you look at Nikes 10 from 2011 they have a line item for stock option expense which is the the value of exercised option plus the tax benefit from stock based repayment.

But looking at walmarts most recent 10k (2020) there is no mention of it in the statement and in the notes the options exercise are Psu's and Rsu'.Yes statement of stockholder equity. I got that I have not problem identifying SBC expense. How do Identify the value of shares issued based on stock options.

To my understanding this is a different number than SBC.Commercial. I definitely don’t have access to IntexThanks so much, I really appreciate the reply. To generalize your comment, can we say that market growth is only bad for a company with an economies of scale advantage if they're selling a product that doesn't have a strong degree of customer captivity (so for all companies with economies of scale and high degree of customer captivity, market growth isn't a threat)? 

Greenwald also mentions that "the need to develop successive new generations of software and hardware makes fixed costs a permanently large part of total costs, and thus a source of economies of scale" for Cisco (and compares this to how PP&E for Philips NV in CD manufacturing once just a one time expense). Can this also be an instance of when market growth isn't a threat to companies with economies of scale or is this not necessarily true in every case? For example, with GM and Compaq, it seems that R&D is permanently a large part of total costs due to this reinvestment pressure.Great thank you!Oh really? Wow I never knew that, makes perfect sense now, thanks!Now how do I do it on my ownChannel based research notebooks? Is that via OneNote?It was from an investment from a bigger pharmaceutical they collaborate with. The stock is still roughly around $20. Unsure about preferred or warrants, just states equity investment.Yes the comparison is striking as the firm has been on an acquisition spree. The non tangible Roc is more in line with the valuation I’m seeing as the tangible roc barely covers cost of capital (which is why I do not thinks it’s an appropriate measure).Hi, thank you for answering. 

I don't know how the waterfall looks like. There is nothing about it in the financials. It is a vertically integrated RE company meaning (I think) that they somehow operate the entities that would work as LPs for a PE firm. 

Regarding the incentive, I don't know. That's exactly what I am trying to find out. 

The company has only 16m of market cap. If you look at revenues, they are terrible because they switched business models in 2018. After that, revenues decreased but margins have improved exponentially. They are managing Top commercial properties in the richest counties of Virginia. Some of there tenants are Google, Amazon, that kind of multinational. Plus, the CEO has been running the company for 35 years. 

My thesis is: This is a no-brainer, as long as these guys keep managing this kind of properties, revenues will continue increasing at least as much as inflation. After 5 years of stable increasing earnings, the P/E should rise. 

So, my question is, is this an obvious non-brainer? Or, instead, am I missing something within the complicated accounting?

Edited to add that notes payables are coming from an entity owned by the CEO. Additionally, the company made 1.8m distributions to Class B members of "Investors X", which is a company owned by the CEO. Is the CEO using Comstock to enrich himself? 

What would you recommend for a beginner investor in a case like this? Keep pushing through the accounting and online forums or instead move on to simpler companies and come back once I have developed a larger accounting acumen?Many thanks! Let me read this over.My farther is a small shareholder in a private company I know is looking to do a buy back. They are initiating the buy back at 2x book value per share - so there’s no market price. 

Should a small minority investor like my farther care about the valuation? They are all selling their shares equally.Thanks! I believe so - the only difference is related to the tax treatment of dividends (taxable immediately) vs deferred capital gains. 

However, looked at as a whole (100% of the equity value, not a per share basis), in both the dividend and share buy back, the book value of equity went down by 10, and the present value of the future income streams are the same. So in total, the value is the same. Capital gains in future don’t seem to be different. 

Just in efficient to pay the 10 out as a dividend due to dividends tax.>Morningstar.com

No, I can only see 3 years' data there, that too, not the full statements. 

For example: [https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/goog/financials](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/goog/financials)I see. I will look into IBISWorld and Statistica as well. Thank you for your inputThanks for sharing your opinion. never have been thought of that situation.Thanks for that. Yes I am aware of that but what is the difference between the two ratios aside from the fact one compares debt to assets and other against market cap? 
ThanksHow would I go about simplifying? Say if I were to remove these sections.

Then the total assets & total liabilities would no longer be reflecting the true amount as listed on the 10k statement.

Is that acceptable when forecasting?Thank you. For some reason I thought that it would be easy to just copy and paste the information then go. It appears I was very wrong and that I can't really skip sorting through the data manually.

Especially when there are certain categories that are hidden in the other categories. Interest expenses hidden in "other income" on the income statement for example. I was going crazy trying to figure out how to solve for EBIT until I realized that some companies hide categories in others.thanks!Wow, this is great! Are these your own notes or from somewhere.

MHH did a 2:1 stock split in Aug 2018.Thanks for your opinion. i haven't been thought of that situation though that's the common case of US companies. i was thinking on controlled company where an entity owns majority of it's shares. since other minority shareholders can't change the CEO in any case. so i thought there should be significant discount for this dictatorship company.Here's a sneak peek of /r/pennystocks using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/top/?sort=top&t=year) of the year!

Thanks for the list, much apppreciated.Thank you but I've already read deepthroat, other sources?Took basic classes in undergradIn the case of media, and at least for the companies I've looked at, they tend to have equity comprise a higher percentage of their capital structure as opposed to debt. Because their capital structure is more equity than debt, I would imagine their ROE is more important to see if they're earning over their cost of equity.Thanks but the GET button isn’t working.They don’t know anything about it. Iv tried like 5x.Thanks, I'll look into that. Do I also need to study managerial accounting before intermediate? I know most intro accounting course sequences are financial in first semester and managerial in second before going to intermediate. With ghat said I'm not sure if managerial is necessary given my goal of learning for investing purposes. 

Thanks again!Thank you for your comment, I gave them a read before I left the question, however I could not find a breakdown in the notes.yeah im just really frustrated tbh, seeing people throw in money at anything and they make bucket loads of money. I mean, Shopify as great as it is , is valued at 50x sales. So people who even bought at 25x sales are making 100%, where is the cash flow? heck,  they dont even have GAAP profit. And its been going on for so long that anyone would think that this is the way now. Only thing keeping me sane is reading articles in the 1999-2000 era and how similar some things were.[deleted]Really appreciate the detailed response, thank you.Outside of that, what are some things to look out for, that may signal a good buy?sure but at the end of the day productivity is severely down, and the economy tends to follow productivity.

I would also argue that most companies are overleveraged and aren't "fundamentally good" - the loans might help bail them out for short term expenses but taking on more debt while also losing out on all revenue without necessarily removing all operating expenses seems like a recipe for disaster

and aren't these companies supposed to be using this money to 

surely there has to be some adverse effects to this level of stimulus - otherwise why wouldn't the fed just operate with unlimited QE at all times? seemingly there are no consequences stocks only go up. I feel like I'm going crazy here>It's not inflation. It's what the Fed is doing with the money they are printing.

That's the definition of inflation. Printing money and purchasing securities with it makes the price of those securities go up.Yes, this helps tremendously. I haven't seen invested capital presented that way before but it makes perfect sense. 

Which brings me to the logical next question I suppose, how do you determine the cost of capital for these sources?I went through Yahoo Finance and took the average PE of all the companies in the same industry as Nike with market cap > $1 Bn. I got 18.17 . I just need to find a way to calculate the intrinsic value as I already have my projected earnings and make sure it is reasonable enough.Isn’t the intended effect of Google choosing to buyback Class C shares versus Class A shares more of a measure to try and keep the two at an equal price, or close to equal price, though?Great collection! Thank you for sharing.link not working :(Legend, thanks mate. Would you suggest to download it or is it likely to stay up?it can be - but remember assets. What if the company has cash that isn't being used? Not exactly useful then.

ROA is def better to measure across different cap structures. Think of ROA is an "unlevered return" and equity as leveredi used to be "wait for secondary research last" truther - but overtime i just don't care. Who cares or knows what the best order is, if i'm digging it im digging in. do whatever works or flow you like. Sometimes the financials can be dry - sometimes they spark you up. Tbh i think research is almost a creative endeavorMy guess is like how most people do it? Think of it like a bond (equity yield) assume growth, that’s your total return.

It’s not rocket science.It depends. If it was only one company and you doubted the managements ability to run it, you would push for BK. If not (like now) it isn’t.

It’s in no ones interest to stop everythingNo one, but everything gets exaggerated and out of wack in the stock market during times of panic.They aren't trading at 3-5x earnings if the earnings are collapsing. Going forward, their earnings are likely negative unless this virus situation gets fixed. 

They can go bankrupt and your equity might not make it to 5 years. It happened to American not even that long ago.Not necessarily, I usually covered the stock that I researched in depth and chatted about that quite a bit. I had a short pitch for a fairly topical recent stock (knew it inside out) and I happened to have a coffee with one of the biggest shorters of it in the country by pure coincidence. Other than that, not really - people would often ask about stocks I have in my portfolio or ask me to walk them through a company I'm looking at at the moment.

Are you still at college? Happy to provide pointers. It can be so daunting at first. I got lucky, both my first two cold emails got me internships.

I'm actually doing a role where I'm jumping across different divisions at the moment which is absolutely awesome, I'm loving it. My firm owns chunks of other boutiques and I'll get to work on a number of different research teams with different sizes, asset classes, strategies and markets which will be unreal. Workload is manageable, better than I thought it would be.I get these through workYeah exactly, high operating margins would be a red flag, they should be lower due to that and also because it is a young growing company.Also, RE apple...that was a strange case.  Steve Jobs wouldn't release any of the money that was made and wouldn't do buybacks.  He was building a Steve Jobs empire.  Tim Cook comes in and says 'i'm giving out the cash' like a good CFO who doesn't have children that he wants to hand the company to.  So, if you have a company valued at $500,000,000,000 with $500,000,000,000 in cash that's earning SOMETHING better than the long term rate interest rate, then it's a screaming buy (I bought it, I hold it, I love it currently).

You have a company that is producing over 20% return on shareholder assets, paying a healthy dividend in excess of their borrowing costs, and buying itself back so I get a larger chunk of the future earnings.

The bearish argument is that they are going to squander their cash...but if you looked at what Cook was doing, he was paying a dividend and buying back shares.  Also you can say that Apple is going to go into the crap hole at some point and people will stop buying their product.  I doubt it.  If Iphones don't ship now, I'm going to wait till they come out, I'm not going to get an Android.  But the future will tell.Well, Kraft earns $7 billion on $6 billion of tangible assets.
Can i replicate Kraft with $6 billion in equipment purchases?
Or do I just figure that if I want to buy a revenue stream, the current price is what I have to pay to get that revenue stream.
BUT.....as Damodaran says about valuation...ain't no spreadsheet gonna keep a manager from purchasing a company if that manager want's to purchase a company...or in other words, if you would like to slice and dice a company up using your own methodology, have at it.   

Now, on the private equity side, you have to look at 'cash free and debt free' sales where the seller takes out all of the cash, so the tangible assets would fall.  If you bought apple, you might be able to keep the cash.  

Next, you can throw in your 'porter's five forces' with emphasis on 'barriers to entry.'  Here I can say that ConEd has a lock on the power distribution market of NY and there ain't gonna ever be a replacement for capital reasons AND regulatory reasons AND lobbying AND NIMBY AND....  But that's what I'd pay for if I was buying ConEd.  Not the liability of the power lines and the capex...but the relative surity that I would get paid.

BUT would I say I'd want to start a business supplying power in NY?  Then I'd look at power generation costs, cost of digging up the ground and installations, ect.  Essentially replacement costs at current market rates.  So, would I add intangible costs into that?  No, but I'd really come up against someone elses' intanglbie costs, also known as their competitive advantage.

So, my long point here, is intangible assets and tangible assets are the company.

If you go back to Graham, he says...discount the tangibles and value the intangibles at zero.  Also Munger says 'the liablities on the balance sheet are real, you have to verify the assets."  Fisher says that the intangibles are the complete company and the tangibles are not where the money is at.

Buffett wants to buy the tangibles at book value, if possible, and then get the earnings for free.  And that methodolgy really hasn't worked.....ever.  Even according to Buffett.Does it make any sense to you to report your profit before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization? It doesn’t to me. It would be like reporting your revenue, you still haven’t listed all of your expenses so why would you go out and brag about 100bn revenue If then the operating expenses amount to 105bn?Is it time to start a merger arb shop? /sCause looking at ROIC isn't that different than analyzing FCF. FCF can be rewritten as FCF = NOPAT - Change of Invested Capital which is very similar to ROIC.ROE as a metric loses usefulness when you start adding too much debt, for sure.

I don't think I can really answer your question about analysing balance sheets, but I would say the times I've seen companies with negative equity, it is companies with positive earnings that have distributed to shareholders at a higher rate than they earn money. I can't say that I like that but usually in that case the companies are generating enough cash to cover their debt repayments. But otherwise, if the company has negative equity and is losing money, I wouldn't touch it.ROE can indicate at what rate the equity is compounding, which has a direct relation with how your investment is compounding. The message I was trying to get across is that in the example, investor return is lowering just as ROE is lowering, because your investment is not compounding.

I think that Buffett praises ROE because he invests in the best of businesses, the ones that can compound at high rates for a long time. In that case, I understand that the rate of compounding (ROE), is the most important thing.I think there is a bit of poker to be played here.  Are you going to kick out a restaurant that will have business the day we reopen in favor of a new one that will not?  You might just need to take an L, I have no idea.  But in theory there are sba loans for this.Yes, I agree with above. I think 10k is preferable to any third party website although I use Yahoo Fin/NASDAQ.com/other websites to get up to date info like PE, market quote, option pricing, etc.They looked at the term structure, and saw the dec28 being the first expiry to trade above dec19 level.
But this is misleading for the above reasonsDepends largely on if their book is mainly fixed rate or floating rate.. 
Fixed rate -> spreads worsen if borrowing costs rise (interbank rises).
Floating -> spreads stay the same.I would consider ignoring it. Why?

\--- Long-winded ---

Conceptually, what ASC 842 is trying to do is \[1\] provide straight-line/flat expensing of rent/lease payments over their useful lives (even when said payments are uneven) and \[2\] an estimate of the present value of both the lease obligation (liability) and asset/property being used (right-of-use asset).

\[2\] is why you're seeing these items on the balance sheet.

I think FASB was attempting to have these lease obligations be presented as something similar to debt in the hopes it would aid in assessing credit risk. Of course, the difference between a lease and actual debt is leases don't <usually> have contingencies where the lessee (occupant) has to repay the full amount remaining under the lease if they cancel early. Usually there's a penalty or fee for cancellation.

My personal view is it's better to just find the amount of amortization expense related to lease assets on the income statement and replace it with the actual cash payments related to lease liabilities. Both of these amounts are usually in the company's cash flows or its footnotes.

Additionally, I would just back-out both the operating lease and operating liability on the balance sheet. They'll mostly offset and the remaining difference is usually placed in other assets or other liabilities, so this usually nets to near zero.

\--- Simple ---

Because you can just supplement the new amortization and assets/liabilities with cash paid for leases quite easily.

Why complicate the matter by using an amortization/expense figure provided by the company with its own assumptions when you have current and future undiscounted cash payments available to you?Basically the best way to learn this is to read that book and understand it and also have a good fundamental understanding of financial statements and accounting. This also won't be a weekend project, it will take more than at least a year or more to get relatively comfortable and even then, you probably won't be very good at it for every single industry. If you're willing to invest the time effort then you should do so for the long term. But if you are expecting to get a handle on these things, by looking at a few indicators in the next few months and be really good, that won't happen.Feel free to DM if you have specific questions or want to discuss your research.Yes that helps. Just keep writing recommendations building models and investing your own account.MS has a few good primers from a couples years backI can tell you that net borrowing has to be included in FCFE, or it's not FCFE. The change in cash available to shareholders due to borrowing is what makes it cash flow to equity.

I've seen FCFF derived in more ways than I can count and I've also seen CFA charter holders disagree about it on AnalystForum, but this is the one that I use in my line of work:

Net income 
+ Depreciation
+ Interest (1-t)
- Working capital investment
- Capital expenditures
= FCFF

Do that, and you can't go wrong. And as always, consider adjusting net income for one-time/non-operating/non-recurring items.I think its best to look elsewhere and find companies that are still beaten down post corona, it would be a better risk/reward ratio than shorting this.Personally I think LAKE is a good bet as the pandemic continues.

Let say if i earn $100 a year a on average i am very unlikely to pay debt of $1000, but dept of $200 can be more or less acceptable.

Imho in the beginning of you investing career it might be better just to avoid companies with weak balance sheets (especially now). You can make a rule for yourself that A to L should be 2:1 for example.Look at their cash flowMost are going to be private, so I would say focus on understanding how to look at the securities first.thank you, wallet example works :)this might be helpful to you

The numerator is to see how much the enterprise would make regardless of capital structure so you add back interest expense.

The denominator is "invested capital" which there's probably many ways to calculate. One way is nwc+ppeNot necessarily, look at the incremental returns on reinvested capital.Go to a cash flow statement (I’m sorry I can’t walk you thru) and look at the other one offs.

Anyway, don't be too worried on getting the final figure, it will change organically as it goes, as events unfold to be better/worse in relative to the company you are tracking, you'll be revising your input and have different output at the end.Some people consider ST Debt to be operating expenses and want to exclude it from D/EThat says total equity and liabilities, the two are not the sameYeah I mean the ticker, which ETN?You chances of getting delivery of physical are virtually zero if you are long a future through a retail broker. The broker will close your position ahead of the notice period, eventually offer you to roll to the next future automatically.
If you want expo to the price itself, future or ETF are giving plain vanilla exposure. But my two comments prevail: take into account the carrying cost in your total return consideration (total return of a commodity is different than spot price continuous), and take into account the leverage ETF decay if you happen to consider them.No need to do anything, if they are in the money and they expire, the broker will assign you the shares.Simpler the better. However if I do a valuation I usually download the 10k on excel, companies usually have all of their tables on different tabs, I go about linking them and putting assumptions on either the inc stmt or bal sheet. Also PPE, stockholder equity schedule, store growth schedule, and the many other feeder schedules (incl more granular revenue breakout if given) may not fit on a 1 tab approach.I tend to go with CapIQ's numbers, but its always a good idea to deconstruct how they got to the number and compare it with the 10Ks.

Some good resources for learning how the adjustments work and effect valuations would be some (relatively) cheap online course offerings such as WallStreetMojo or WallStreetPrep. WallStreetPrep is higher quality IMO, but more expensive. WallStreetMojo offers a lot of free content.

An even cheaper option would be the book Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies by McKinsey and Co.you can use either - but you need to understand what the adjustments are. For example, if you take adjusted numbers that remove SBC, then to make sure you are accounting for all economic costs (SBC is a cost - a company is issuing equity that dilutes current shareholders), you need to either forecast stock dilution going forward or assume that the company will buy back stock from its FCF to offset dilution (which is essentially the same thing as including SBC,Here just the balance sheet line items would do if you understand what the line items are. Nothing is hidden, it’s just understanding what the line items are.Thanks. I am glad to help.

I see a lot of questions are not answered here (some of them are mine) so I though I will at least try to help some else (If I have knowledge).

I don't know anything about HTZ, but from a very quick look at finviz, I see they have a huge debt.   
Debt/Eq = 9.66

It makes it looks like a risky investment (e.g. in "Intellegent Investor" it's recommended Debt/Eq to be less than 0.5 for a passive investor).

It could be the company has "hidden" values, but you need to find them.

I would not recommend buying a company, because other value investors buy it unless you understand exactly why. I made this, and so far I regret a little bit about it. Here are the following problems:

* Other investors can hedge their positions with options, which is not declared in public reports
* You will likely will uncomfortable holding a position, that you don't understand fully. And you will not know when to sell.

You can construct any ratio breakdown the way you want as long as the end of the day the terms cancel out in such a way that you get to your desired result.

Good luck![deleted]> If you do that, I strongly suggest you have a better rationale than "yields are stupidly low and have got to mean-revert eventually". 

im not making any moves atm. Just curious. 

Another question, the quoted yield on US treasury bonds, is that the coupon rate or is it the Yield to maturity? I mean, can treasury bonds even have a YTM? Since they do not have a price.

This is what im talking about :

It makes sense cyclicality would also reflect in changes in working capital.How are they using cashflow and investing, and what returns are their getting on that. Management can allocate capital in three ways normally: dividends, stock buybacks or reinvesting in the business.GDP/market cap

The intuition behind it is that gdp is a measure of the economy and the stock market will grow with the economy (corp earnings cannot outpace the economy long-term). It actually is one of the best measures for valuation, in terms of historic accuracy. As you said, book value is distorted by accounting. Corporate earnings are distorted by the business/debt/sentiment cycle. GDP however is nice and steady.You can do more with python faster, you can use r but no sense building Rome then reading you one to add one last temple and it’s impossibleWhat are you asking? You can get a pretty clear of history by reading earnings callsYes, just use an API or build a web app. 

https://old.datahub.io/dataset/edgarYou can actually produce a precise measurement — intrinsic value — for stocks that, if you’re good, you can anticipate what you can make on them. Meaning if you’re really good, you can generate infinite returns. Without respect to the speculation of a stock, if you think it is undervalued and you buy it, it will go up because of Reinvesting, buybacks, dividends - where you receive a payout in some form. I wouldn’t put gold and RE in the same bucket (because you can rent the house which generates CF), real estate and stock picking are both more formulaic. If you rank speculate stocks, they’ll become way overvalued or way undervalued, leaving people to buy and sell them to value them at equilibrium. 

In reference to the price of gold, with no reference of cost to mine it, etc — you gain capital from gold from its sale. It increases in value as more people demand it, not because it is shooting off cash, but because it’s shooting off pretty light. 

Also, historically stocks have returned astronomically more than gold, through lack of rank speculation and using valuation, you can compound your capital faster — you really can’t do this buying and selling gold... well, maybe there are a select few. 

Maybe a better way to phrase this would be, do you think you have a better chance of predicting the market 3 months out? Can you predict a stock that you’ve chosen after looking at 100 of them carefully? Which one do you feel more confident in.I personally use pre-tax because I ran a fairly international portfolio, the accounting treatment is going to vary on a country by country basis. And while I do appreciate management that understands efficient tax planning (Malone) its rarely among the main drivers of an investment thesis for me.In a traditional structure, a RIA is the firm and the person working for the firm is an IAR. If you are a sole proprietor, you would also be a RIA (I believe) but you'd still be an IAR as well. This is my understanding of it but I could be wrong.

However since the market isn't perfect, it may take a while or sometimes not happen for decades. That's why you should do extra research to make sure the company that you evaluated has potential to recover and has good long term stability and growth prospects.One thing to also add is that value investing has changed a lot since Ben Graham and even Buffett's time back in the day.

There's no free lunch today - companies cheap by "traditional metrics" are trading at that for a reason.

Basically, what I am saying is that value investing is a lot more work today than it was when Buffett was running his investment partnership and able to buy a healthy insurance company trading at a P/E of 3.

For REITs, I'm not sure why it would be appropriate to add back interest expense but not for stocks. Your equation also doesn't address taxes, which is one of the benefits of a REIT structure. This is the equation I use for ROIC:

ROIC = NOPAT / Invested Capital

NOPAT = EBITA \* (1 - cash tax rate)

Invested Capital = NWC + PPE + Goodwill + Other operating assets

TBH I haven't really thought about how it should be adjusted for REITs.Here are a few:

In those types of industries, a cost plus model ( reinvesting into further cost cutting and cheaper services) may be optimal. 

For q2, I believe my previous answer already touched on that. Hardware with short obsolescence cycles (I.e mobiles) creates lower fcf streams over their life cycle purely due to higher reinvestment requirements to maintain market share.

* ROIC = NOPAT / IC, where IC = Assets - Cash - Non-interest bearing current liabilities

* Tangible ROIC = NOPAT / (IC - Goodwill - Intangibles)

Since the denominator is lower in the tangible ROIC, the overall return should be higherHe should care if the business is worth more than two times book value. What kind of company is it? Small private contractors are usually valued at around 1-2x book value, so that wouldn't be unusual. But professional services firms with very few assets (e.g. no book value) are usually worth much more than that. And the operating agreements for companies like your father is invested in are sometimes written to give him the short end of the stick. He should review the operating agreement to see what the procedure is for situations like this. 

I obviously don't know the details of this situation, but my general inference is that if the controlling interest(s) don't want to get a proper valuation done, it means the business is worth more and they're getting a deal.You can click on income statement to get more years.

You aren't investing in companies because they are earning over their cost of equity but rather over the cost of capital which should take into account debt regardless of what percentage that may be.Check out library genesis and search for the book there. There are 5 sources provided usually.I wouldn’t worry about managerial too much unless you’re curious.

Most of it just focuses on how to tabulate and move money spent on inventory/products between expenses and assets (I.e., how much do you D expense and C asset when you’ve sold something).

Nothing of that is doing well right now.>sure but at the end of the day productivity is severely down, and the economy tends to follow productivity.

I told you why the stock market was up. I never said the economy was doing well. It definitely is divorcing asset prices from reality. But it still drives stocks higher. Some of it is speculation for huge gains and some of it is because a company will survive.

>I would also argue that most companies are overleveraged and aren't "fundamentally good" - the loans might help bail them out for short term expenses but taking on more debt while also losing out on all revenue without necessarily removing all operating expenses seems like a recipe for disaster

Leverage only matters if you can't service the debt. I agree there are plenty of overleveraged companies and there will still be bankruptcies. Check out AMC today - they were down a ton because there is belief they will still go bankrupt, even with todays announcement. Many other companies people see a way forward - it's very speculative but gives hope (thus a big rally).

I think you're thinking of the small business loans - that to be forgiven are required to go to employee paychecks. Big corporations don't have that stipulation - most of them are going to the debt market to raise debt and then the Fed can buy any that is lacking demand.

>surely there has to be some adverse effects to this level of stimulus - otherwise why wouldn't the fed just operate with unlimited QE at all times? seemingly there are no consequences stocks only go up. I feel like I'm going crazy here

Depends what economic theories you subscribe too... but I believe absolutely... but that's down the road. This is mortgaging our future. 

I studied the Japanese economy a lot in school - read up on their lost decade and zombie companies. We are entering a dangerous place IMO - however, you're going to see gains because many of the stocks that had bankruptcy potential yesterday - do not today. So lots of people are going to buy them.

I'm not a fan of how this is going down but I also understand doing something that seems like a better idea is threading a needle and risking a very, very bad outcome. I would rather have the government dilute equity holders to get a return and to disincentive debt accumulation in the future... but because this is a virus (or maybe because they are afraid to take the equity value away from pensions and retirement accounts) they won't do that.First, no one is printing money and buying equities with the money so that is not putting upward pressure on equity prices. Second, most of the money hasn't gone out yet and we are currently in a deflationary period right now for most items - you can clearly see this with oil and this is due to no demand - I bet you can get a way better deal on a car, a cruise, plane tickets, etc. than you could have a couple months ago. 

The biggest gainers yesterday were stuff like Gap and other distressed companies that have been told that if they want to issue debt their company will have a buyer - equity prices are reacting to the fact that the company is being told they will come out the otherside of this no matter what and have a much lower risk of bankruptcy than before.

Demand for a specific field, porter concurrency model, macroeconomy, legal insider trading, official announcements, operational risk, consumer psychology, behavioral trading, some statistical correlation on indicators. I guess all these factors minimize the risk of losing money in an investment, especially if the company is solid.

But with even high yields apparently having a Fed put now, I don't know :)Yes, the quoted yields are yields to maturity (the coupon rate is normally in the name of the security). They are traded in secondary markets and do have a price though, [random example](https://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/bond/us9128287b09-america-united-states-of-1-875-19-26) (that's the listing of an US treasury in Frankfurt though; don't know which exchange treasuries trade on in the US).Who knows, but I'm done questioning their wisdom ;)

But more seriously, probably some combination of QE, institutions with mandates to invest "safely" (in nominal terms anyway, heh) and people speculating on capital gains as yields drop even further, or on the long-term/short-term rate differentials I mentioned (and winning at it, like my counterparties).

And bank accounts have negative interest rates too - usually not for small amounts, because banks don't want to annoy customers for pennies, but there isn't really a risk-free zero-yield way to store large amounts of Euros these days.

The reasons are IMO 1) is a biased information, because CEOs will try to sweeten the causes of the problems giving not partial root cause explanations, they want to create value and optimism 2) MOST IMPORTANT earning calls are published with the quarters, and I could have the urge to know something before an official earning call is published.

Final question; where would you look for the one year data for Google sheets, if I were to create something myself?Hey man, 

Thanks again for this, I'm really enjoying this discussion. Really appreciate you helping me expand my mind into how to further think about this.

I completely get what you are saying about capital. Opportunity cost is a real cost, so you are in fact destroying value if you invest suboptimally. 

I think the big takeaway here is that the model makes the assumption that the companies are, as you said, going concerns. Whatever is in the "BV" is locked up. In that case, yes, I agree. The initial BV then doesn't matter since you can't "cash out", so the company's value is only derived insofar as how much it'll return for your capital. A trillion dollars in BV returning $3 is "worth" only $30 because I can't do anything because I can't liquidate. 

I still think that the model is flawed. In my opinion, models are only great insofar as how well it fits into reality. The fact that it is going to value the trillion dollar BV company at $30 makes no sense because in reality, someone will come in and liquidate. Book value does matter because that's what you literally own as a shareholder. 

Now I get that in most situations, shareholders can't liquidate immediately, so it'd be inaccurate to assign complete value to the BV. But I still think that's hell of a lot closer than what the model would suggest. 

Let's consider the example again. A trillion dollar BV company returning $3 per year. For further simplify, let's assume all of the BV is in pure cash. The model will calculate its value at $30.

Two ways to think about this. Pretend that this company really exists in the real world.

1) The company is a going concern, and shareholders usually can't liquidate whenever they want to. Therefore, the only thing that matters is the percentage return, so $30 is the correct value. 

2) The shareholders legally own a trillion dollars in book value now. Therefore, the actual value would be the BV (trillion) + $30. Therefore, even if the company is trading for say, half a trillion dollars, it makes sense to purchase it. As a shareholder, you expect its market value to eventually align with reality. 

Now, I get that the actual value is probably less than BV (trillion) + $30 because it will take time for the market to align. But I am of the contention that 2) calculates the company's value much, much closer than 1). 

Logically speaking, which method makes more sense to you if this happened in real life? 2) makes much, much more sense. 

Therefore, I would propose that the model is only used when it calculates a value greater than BV. If not, the floor should be "capped" at BV at most.

And since we're on the topic, I'd love to get your thoughts on the idea on required return / cost of capital vs risk. I can't quite reconcile equating cost of capital and required return. 

I get the underlying reasoning. Your required return, at minimum, should be at least the cost of capital because that's supposed to be your opportunity cost. If I could have gotten 10% elsewhere, my "cost" is 10%, so my required return better be at least 10%. 

This logic is crystal clear to me when we consider risk free returns i.e. your required return should at LEAST be whatever the risk free rate is. But when we add in risk, it gets a bit hazy for me. 

Let's say I have a risky company, so I arbitrarily set my required return at 20%. Is that really my cost of capital though? I guess it COULD be, but that makes the grand assumption I could have made 20% elsewhere with similar risk. That is impossible to know, so it is my view that equating the definitions of "cost of capital" and "required return" is inaccurate once we factor in risk. Sure, it's my required return based on my subjective assessment of risk vs reward, but in no way it is necessarily my cost of capital, I'd never know unless I was God.Right. Let's say there is not stock option exercised line item in the statement. 

But in the notes there us information regarding PSU's and RSU's exercised/vested. Is that considered stock options exercised?

Yes, it’s not as detailed as Bloomberg or WSJ or something like that, but I love itBloomberg.com has great news coverage. You only get a limited number of articles before having to pay.

These things are great for news. Try to also read ideas. Here's a good free letter. Take each idea with a grain of salt but it's a nice way to at least look at some ideas:

http://www.uscfinvestments.com/holdings/usoyesThank you!Earnings calls are forward looking, but you can’t lie on them. They’ll shed a positive light on the company but it’s your job to see through that. I’d say in terms of accuracy SEC fillings > earnings calls > company announcements > investigative journalists that are credible > news > stuff you hear. At the end of the day you’re understanding the companies financial position not speculating on news. If you’re competitive advantage lies in financial analysis for retail companies, stick to that and use the above to fill in the gaps you can’t. I think your three equity strategy is fine (consider maybe getting up to 5-10 for diversification) but I’d argue news is more forward looking than almost everything else.No worries. Start by opening the 4Q19 earnings press release. Most of the data is in the "Reconciliations to Nearest U.S. GAAP Measures by Line Item" table. That is where I arrived at $723.9. 

To see the components of this, look at page 102 of the 10-K. It consists of: 

US Asset abandonment: 15.8 

Canada Goodwill impairment: 668.3 

Canada Asset impairment: 23 

Europe Asset abandonment: 1.2 

International Goodwill and intangible impairment: 12.2 

Corporate: 3.4 

= $723.9 / 216.9 (diluted shares outstanding) = $3.34Taxes are a bit different. Think of it this way... You are removing costs (adding back) that are not recurring. Therefore the extra income needs to be taxed. So these are the taxes on the incremental income. 

Employee related charges are explained on pg 40 of the 10-K and in the supplemental notes.  

Further, we currently expect to incur certain cash and non-cash restructuring charges related to employee relocation, severance, retention and transition costs, non-cash asset related costs, lease exit costs in connection with our office lease in Denver, Colorado, and other transition activities estimated in the range of approximately $120 million to $180 million in the aggregate, the majority of which will be cash charges that we began recognizing in the fourth quarter of 2019, and will be further spread through the balance of fiscal years 2020 and 2021. In 2019, we recognized aggregate impairment losses of $2.1 million related to the closure of the Denver, Colorado office facility. Additionally, in 2019 we recognized severance and retention charges of $41.2 million, of which, approximately $40 million remained accrued as of December 31, 2019. We recognized these charges as special items within our consolidated statements of operations. See Part II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, “Note 7, Special Items” for additional details. Actual severance and retention costs related to this restructuring, which are primarily being recognized ratably over the employees’ required future service period, may differ from original estimates based on actual employee turnover levels prior to achieving severance and retention eligibility requirements. Employee relocation charges are recognized in the period incurred and were immaterial in 2019.I'd pull the constituents of the an index like the R2K.

Here is the documentation page: https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093281?hl=en[deleted]I think I understand what you are asking, so let me take a shot.

RSUs and PSUs are types of stock options that typically vest over longer periods of time (multiple years). Restricted stock and restricted stock units are measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the Company’s common stock. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. To the extent restricted stock or restricted stock units are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to “Stock-based compensation.”

Take a look at anti-dilutive securities. They should be included in those.Shot in the dark but maybe post on Wall Street oasis or somewhere on here, maybe frame it as you’re a student looking for help and want to look at some CMBS collateral. Idk what your use for it is. It’ll tell you some lagged data and it’ll have loan level characteristics that’ll vary in granularity by deal.Follow on investments are commonly structured as convertible preferred equity (again not sure if this is the case for you), meaning it can convert to common and share all the upside OR remain preferred (i.e. they get paid out before common in a liquidation scenario). If it's preferred, you would expect a premium to commonDepends on the book value. If the book value of the company is $1 million and there are 10 shares, the book value per share is $100,000. So the difference between 1.5x and 2x book value is the difference between $150,000 and $200,000. 

And generally (but not always), businesses are worth more than 1-2x book value.Yes, given the inputs of the equation that makes sense.I mean, you can learn how to do it given enough time. But if you can make just as much money investing in easier to understand companies, why handicap yourself by trying to learn a fairly difficult industry? Unless you are also confident in your ability to do well and earn returns in it. 

If you aren't already earning good returns in regular companies then the odds of you doing it in biotech are a lot slimmer.

There is good reason why the number of firms that have very good long term records in biotech are a lot fewer than those that focus on other industries.

Also being a buy side or sell side analyst doesn't necessarily mean you are a good investor and will beat the market, the vast majority of them don't.Sounds like you got the link to work. [Here's the site](http://gen.lib.rus.ec/search.php) I mentioned. This is the most comprehensive collection of books I've ever seen online. If it's not here you're unlikely to find it elsewhere (for free).Yeah the generally happens with the C class that's why they buy back more. However going back to your initial question, I just looked at the tickers and it seems the shares are trading where they  have always trading, basically par, with the A voting shares slightly above by just a dollar, so maybe you had looked at the wrong ones?

And another thing is that while the A shares do have voting powers, the owners of the B shares basically have 60% of the voting powers. So A shares are effectively powerless and there shouldnt be much of a premium on them.Sure, but when you consider what you are paying for the company are you subtracting the tangible assets from the purchase price?Thats the simple answer, but the banks also have contractual obligations so its a bit tricky on that aspect. Like do money market funds get frozen too?I've caught wind of that bromide. I definitely think I'll have to keep watching the company to see if it becomes a better short candidate. I've never actively looked to short companies though so I'm learning this as I go. Lakeland kinda made themselves seem like an easy candidate with their auditors saying the company isn't acting right.Grazie! 

Diciamo che due anni fa ho scoperto il value investing e mi sono appassionato a questo e alle materie economiche e finanziarie.

Cercando di analizzare il business delle banche ho incontrato però delle difficoltà, quindi sto pian piano imparando e cercando più informazioni su come queste operino (dal vero e proprio punto di vista del management), mi spiego:

Per gestire un ristorante il proprietario deve avere una conoscenza della ristorazione, occuparsi dei fornitori, gestire la stagionalità del business, gli orari a cui il ristorante sarà occupato o meno, gestire il flusso di cassa così da poter pagare stipendi, materie prime, ecc.

Allo stesso modo il management di una banca deve gestire il rapporto tra depositi e prestiti, mantenere una solida balance sheet, gestire le riserve ed i NPL, generare sani flussi di cassa, sapere in che misura può usufruire e sfruttare a pieno i piani della BCE come TLTRO, ricorrere alla leva finanziaria in modo coscienzioso (e non per pagare dei dividendi, che non può permettersi, in un anno andato male dal punto di vista operativo), ecc.

Ciò che vorrei approfondire è quindi il modello di business di una banca e tutte le sfaccettature di cui il management deve tenere conto per far sì che questa funzioni correttamente nel lungo termine.

Fortunatamente internet è uno strumento estremamente vasto e potente per imparare, cosa che sfrutto a pieno, però la mia conoscenza di molti argomenti è purtroppo frammentata. 
Sfortunatamente devo ancora aspettare 1 anno per arrivare all’università e non ho avuto modo di trovare dei corsi o insegnamenti completi online riguardo la materia.Cool, while we're at it. How would you determine fcf for a bank? I know that debt for normal companies isn't what debt is for banks. So it's a bit trickyGot it. Thanks for taking the time to have this convo.Cool, you are in sync with all my thoughts, thanks you gave me poor gold for a value investor wanna be as meAwesome. Do you think the residual model is one of the better models out there? My goal is to find the one that makes logical sense, and one that I can confidently apply. I think trying to use DCF is one of the most useless things you can do, so I really like what Penman tries to do by trying to calculate the growth rates the market is implying within a stock price. 

I'm somewhat well-versed in the academic models. I personally think they are a load of crap, CAPM included. To me, risk is defined as the possibility of loss. Conflating that with a company's historical volatility in its stock price (Beta) is ludicrous to me. I get why they did that though, since it's really pretty much the only way you can even begin to quantify the idea of how risky a company is. 

I think one of the greatest pitfalls in investing is that people conflate great investments with great companies. Everybody only talks about how to identify great companies, but nobody talks about how to intelligently determine whether the price is attractive. I would always rather buy a Honda Civic for free than a Ferrari for a million dollars. 

This is an issue I am trying to tackle by looking into these valuation models. I need to understand how to intelligently use the numbers to determine whether an assets price does indeed deviate from value, but it's so hard.I see. So in a situation like walmarts most recent 10k in which there is no line item for stock options exercised but there are psus and RSU's vested/exercised within the calendar year we are to assume that the stock option exercise value is 0? I'm asking because I'm working through Penmans Security valuation textbook and I have to reformat the statement of stockholder equity.But say the share buy back is fixed at $400k in your example and there are two shareholders with 5 shares each. 

If the buy back is at 1.0x book (4 shares bought back), there will be 6 shares left, 3 for each shareholder - leaving them with a 50% shareholding each, and 200k in their pockets each. 

If you buy back at 2.0x book there will be two shares bought back. Each shareholder will have 4 shares - with the same 50% shareholding and also 200k in their pocket each. So 1.0x and 2.0x valuations leave them both as well off as the other.I can’t thank you enough. Books I couldn’t find anywhere (Accounting for Growth by Terry Smith) including Amazon just showed up in great quality.Funnily enough, the Class C shares of $GOOG were about $5 above the Class A shares of $GOOGL at the time of my posting as it had been for a few months at this point, but around 15 minutes after I posted my question, the prices of both immediately began to revert back to each other.

Did a human see my post and decide to carry out some arbitrage, was it a machine that automatically parsed my question, or is this all just a matter of random noise and chance? I suppose we’ll never know.No.I cant even think about that shit just print 6 trilly kthxWow! Credo che all'università avrai poca difficoltà...avrai difficoltà a trovare qualcuno che ne sappia così tanto di queste cose! Davvero complimenti...
Ti do due libri tecnici: "Economia degli intermediari finanziari" e "Risk management and shareholders' value in banking". Quest'ultimo è abbastanza completo.
Qualcosa di soft per mantenere la curiosità lo trovi qui  https://ig.ft.com/sites/business-book-award/categories/banking-and-finance/ sono libri premiati o comunque consigliati dal Financial Times.I don't know banks well enough. I'm going to leave that for someone else.

Banks are a lot of trouble...honestly there are other simpler, very good companies ou there at good prices (if you think the virus won't kill the country)(my pleasure)well I should not say gold:) as we buy securities ahahaStock options are a very small part of Walmart's compensation program. It is probably fine to assume 0. 

Just for reference, the proxy says:

"We have not granted stock options to our Executive Officers since 2007, and stock options are not currently a part of our executive compensation program. If and when we grant stock options in the future, the exercise price will be equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant."

In the 10-K, there is a line item devoted to share-based compensation. The amount is very small, practically immaterial, especially when considering the size of WMT's total share-based compensation.

On page 61 of the 10-K:

"The stock option share-based compensation expense is included in the Other line in the table above." It was \~$31M.If the shares were bought back at 2x book value then each shareholder would receive $200k per share and pocket $400k each. The buyback being "fixed at $400k" means that at 1x book value, 4 shares are repurchased and at 2x book value, 2 shares are repurchased.Welcome.
Personally I have to policy of buying books that I find there and end up reading. Everyone has to make that call themselves though.👍👍Another theoretical question for you. 

In the $500b and you want a 10% return so $50b continuously, should you discount those future cashflows as well so that you can compare it to a PV analysis of the NI of the company? Wdyt?Thats the plan and banks are suppose to pass this forward, but they arent at least from what im hearing from friends who hold commercial and residential loansGrazie mille, davvero, il secondo titolo mi sembra particolarmente interessante, lo leggerò sicuramente!

“ Economia degli intermediari finanziari “ del DISEI (Dipartimento di studi per l’economia e l’impresa)?You got itThank you for the clarification. I've been trying to figure this out for the passed couple of daysyesGli autori del secondo libro sono Sironi e Resti se ti servono per ricercare il libro (che è in inglese). Economia degli Intermediari finanziari di Nadotti, Porzio, Previati edito da McGraw Hill. Sono due testi universitari e molto probabilmente l’ultimo lo utilizzerai se farai economia.No prob. Generally the proxy will have more info about compensation. It is a good place to start if you have questions.👍I really appreciate it thank you!

One more questions then thats it lol.

So this is the reformatted statement of equity I put together based on the Penman text. 

[https://imgur.com/OTrcziv](https://imgur.com/OTrcziv)

The first part of it is identifying net transactions with shareholders. In a situation like walmart's would there be any stock issue to employee? I know this might sound similar to my previous question but in the example that Penman gave of nike between 2009-2011 there was also a line item for stock issuance to employee.

How is issuance different than stock-option?Net transactions with shareholders would be buybacks. The stock issued to employees would be from exercised/vested RSUs and PSUs. The data is in Note 3 of the 10-K. The table includes both the share data and value.

&#x200B;

Can you ask the last question again? I'm not sure I understand the question.I'm trying to understand how stock options are different from stock issuance.. The textbook I'm reading makes a clear distinction between stock issues to stock options and stock issues to employees which along with stock repurchases and dividends equate to net transactions with shareholders.  The picture that I posted is the exact model that the author built in the book which depicts the reformatted statement of shareholder equity.

I'm having trouble understanding and consistently finding the information regarding stock issuance's whether it be for stock options or otherwise.  The rest of the info needed I have no problem understanding or gathering.

I hope this makes sense. I've been reading through 10-k's all night and am starting to lose brain power.I had to pull up Nike's 10-k to figure it out. In 2010, Nike had an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP). An ESPP is a tax-efficient means by which employees of a corporation can purchase the corporation's stock, often at a discount.

Walmart does not have an ESPP. So it is not relevant for your analysis.

For clarification, here is the distinction:

1. Stock issued to employees is via the ESPP.
2. Stock issued for stock options is from compensation awards.

Does that make sense?Yes that makes alot of sense and I appreciate all your help today.No worries. Take care,Ah man what happened to [http://minesafetydisclosures.com/](http://minesafetydisclosures.com/)

The 62-year-old titan of the $3.2tn global hedge fund industry predicted the downfall of US energy giant Enron almost two decades ago, making a fortune in the process. But the course of true riches, it seems, never did run smooth.

It’s three days before “Super Saturday”, when London’s restaurants and bars can reopen. I’ve been granted an exception and am the sole diner. Social distancing would not be a problem here, however. The round tables are generously spaced apart, designed with discretion in mind.


I am to have early dinner — Chanos is to have lunch. He is in Miami Beach, where he has been stuck since the start of lockdown in early March. For our encounter, he has persuaded Prime 112 steakhouse, his go-to place on Friday nights, to allow him to use its private room. When he comes on screen, his air is more benevolent academic than pantomime villain, dressed in a white open-necked shirt and blazer. Chanos likes to present himself as a “real-time financial detective who is incentivised to root out fraud”. Or, more prosaically, a “forensic financial statement junkie”.


To critics, short selling represents the scourge of modern capitalism. Whereas so-called value investors such as Warren Buffett try to buy shares in companies that the market is underestimating, short-sellers such as Chanos seek out overvalued companies. They borrow shares and then sell them, hoping to buy them back later for less. In short, “they are profiting when others are losing money”, says Chanos — and this makes some people uncomfortable.


Chanos is buoyant. A week earlier, one of his largest short positions — the German payments company Wirecard — filed for bankruptcy, after admitting that €1.9bn of its cash probably did “not exist”. This followed a five-year FT investigation into its accounting practices. Chanos’s funds made almost $100m from the trade, according to an investor. He laughs: “It’s bittersweet, Harriet, because short-sellers put up with weeks and months of misery, and you feel good for hours and days.”


Even its detractors acknowledge that short selling, in a normal environment, helps the markets to question conventional wisdom. But a sharper complaint, usually heard from targets, is that short-sellers acting together to sow FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) about a company’s accounting or financial position can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. In the past, investors such as Chanos have moved markets just by revealing a bet against a particular company.


It’s bittersweet . . . Short-sellers put up with weeks and months of misery, and you feel good for hours and days


Chanos happily concedes that he talks frequently to other short-sellers. He shorted Luckin Coffee, once touted as China’s answer to Starbucks, after Carson Block of Muddy Waters encouraged him to look at it. (The company is now being investigated for accounting fraud.) But it’s “a myth” that short-sellers act together, he tells me from Prime 112’s private room. “If there were conspiracies, we’d be in something much more profitable than short selling.”


I mention Canadian insurer Fairfax Financial. It sued a group of hedge funds, including those run by Chanos, Dan Loeb and Steve Cohen, for allegedly driving down its stock under a short selling scheme. “That was the perception, but it wasn’t true,” says Chanos. “The case was thrown out [in 2018] on jurisdictional grounds. Our allegation was that the company was overstating their earnings, and during the process they restated their earnings.”


Chanos’s hedge fund manager Kynikos Associates is named after the ancient Greek word for “cynic”. His pitch is that he can identify corporate disasters-in-the-making. The New York-based outfit employs 20 people and has $1.5bn in assets under management. Chanos also teaches a course on the history of financial fraud (“how to detect it, not how to commit it”, he quips) at Yale University, his alma mater. The syllabus stretches back to the 17th century. Today, he says, “we are in the golden age of fraud”.

Chanos describes the current environment as “a really fertile field for people to play fast and loose with the truth, and for corporate wrongdoers to get away with it for a long time”. He reels off why: a 10-year bull market driven by central bank intervention; a level of retail participation in the markets reminiscent of the end of the dotcom boom; Trumpian “post-truth in politics, where my facts are your fake news”; and Silicon Valley’s “fake it until you make it” culture, which is compounded by Fomo — the fear of missing out. All of this is exacerbated by lax oversight. Financial regulators and law enforcement, he says, “are the financial archaeologists — they will tell you after the company has collapsed what the problem was.”


All in all, it’s “a heady witch’s brew for trouble”.I’d like to kindly remind investors on three crucial points:
1) Chanos is long an index and short individual constituents
2) The FED can stay irrational longer than you can stay liquid
3) Long post do not equal good posts.

Last point can be expanded on with one of my favorite quotes: “I can write concise, but sometimes I get lazy and keep on writing.”So Chanos is right. But there's plenty of slack left in the system. Without writing some massive comment, I'll just quickly point out the obvious. The next stage of monetary policy is what I would consider a primary indicator of such a catalyst. I guess the demand side has technically already started with the so called stimulus checks, but for some reason it feel incongruous.   I mean it seems apparent now that we're likely to see an extended period of stagflation, which many predicted.~~Wallstreet~~ Fraudstreet. Yea, we know.Yes sir.It'll get flagged if somebody were to copy and paste, plus there's a graph. See PDF of page [here](https://www.docdroid.net/UlaFuWT/jim-chanos-we-are-in-the-golden-age-of-fraud-financial-times-pdf).Chanos’s mission is focused on understanding a company’s business model and then ascertaining if its financial statements reflect it. Certain themes crop up time and again in his hunt for short positions: technological obsolescence, consumer fads, single-product companies, growth via acquisitions and accounting games. Notably he looks for “legal fraud” — where companies adhere to the accounting rules and regulations but there’s still an “intent to deceive”. Enron epitomised this — Chanos identified that it was using aggressive accounting to front-load profits and hide debt in its subsidiaries.


He wasn’t the first short-seller to the Wirecard party. Chanos initiated a short in the German payments company last year and increased the position last autumn, when the FT published documents indicating that profits at Wirecard units in Dubai and Dublin were fraudulently inflated and that customers listed in documents provided to auditor EY did not exist.


Wirecard’s collapse, when it finally came, was dramatic. But, says Chanos, most fraud is on the edges. And these days, often it is “staring at you right in the face through the use of company-designed metrics” through which they are “gaming the system”. He is referring to creative accounting measures used to flatter companies’ books, notably office-space provider WeWork’s now infamous community-adjusted ebitda. The coronavirus crisis has spawned “ebitdac”, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortisation — and coronavirus — where companies are adding back profits they say they would have made but for the pandemic.


Regulators, he says, could be much firmer in clamping down on metrics “that just are increasingly unmooring themselves from reality”.


Growing up as the son of Greek and Irish immigrants who ran a chain of dry-cleaning shops in Milwaukee, Chanos says he was interested in stock markets at an early age. After Yale, he worked for an investment bank in Chicago and then retail brokerage Gilford Securities, where he began writing research on individual stocks. He had a baptism by fire: “The first major company I looked at and wrote up turned out to be an immense accounting fraud.”


Baldwin-United was a piano company that had morphed into a financial supermarket. Chanos’s research pointed out inconsistencies with its numbers and recommended that investors sell the stock. It went bankrupt the following year, in 1983, at the time the largest-ever US corporate bankruptcy. Baldwin’s collapse piqued the interest of Gilford’s hedge fund clients who followed its stock recommendations, notably George Soros and Michael Steinhardt. “What else does the kid not like?” they asked, Chanos recalls.


Soon afterwards, he joined Deutsche Bank in New York. It was a shortlived affair. In September 1985, The Wall Street Journal ran a front-page investigation into the “aggressive methods” of a network of short-sellers that it alleged was driving down the shares of US companies. The then 27-year-old Chanos was portrayed as an enfant terrible at the centre of the network. “People think I have two horns and spread syphilis,” he quipped in the article. Deutsche fired him and his boss. “The postscript is that nine of the 10 companies mentioned [in the article] either went bankrupt or were prosecuted for fraud,” he says.


Jim Chanos pockets $100m from Wirecard short
Chanos’s wedge salad and my own starter (a plate of oysters, deliciously juicy, with a glass of crisp white Burgundy) arrive.


It must take a certain personality type to be a perma-bear, I venture.


A long time ago, Chanos believed that going short was just “the mirror image of going long”. He has changed his tune on this, however, “because there is a lot of behavioural finance at work in the markets”. On Wall Street, he says, “the bull case is everywhere” — optimistic management projections, takeover rumours that boost targets’ stock prices, and company earnings estimates revised upwards.


“So I think that it does take a certain peculiar personality — and I’ll leave it at that — to say ‘OK, here’s my facts and here’s the conclusions I draw from my facts, and that’s why I think there’s an opportunity on the short side here.’”


Many can’t stomach it. Less than a year after the 1985 launch of Kynikos — amid “the rip-roaring bull market” of the time — Chanos’s business partner declared that he wasn’t comfortable with the pure short selling side of the business. He said his accountant had advised him to sell back his stake to Chanos for a nominal amount of $1. “And I paid him right there on the spot out of my wallet,” says Chanos. “It was the greatest trade I think I ever did,” he adds with a chuckle.


Chanos has put the remains of his salad to one side to make way for the steak. I’m delighted by my main course: deep red toro tuna carpaccio, garnished with avocado mousse.


My guest has one of the best track records in the hedge fund industry. The Kynikos Capital Partners fund, a long/short equity strategy, has gained 22 per cent a year on average over the past 35 years — double that of the S&P 500 index. In the same period, against the backdrop of rising equity markets, its US short-only Ursus strategy — named after the Latin for “bear” — has lost 2 per cent a year.


Kynikos performance chart against the S&P 500 
The past decade has been a difficult one for short-sellers in general, as trillions of dollars of central bank stimulus have lifted prices of assets indiscriminately across the board. How do you trade that? “Very carefully and painfully,” he says.


Fundraising has been tough. Kynikos’s assets peaked at around $7bn after 2008, when short-only Ursus gained 44 per cent, net of fees. They have slumped to $1.5bn since then. This year Chanos sold a minority stake in the management company to boutique investment firm Conlon & Co and the family office of Richard M Daley, former mayor of Chicago.


Prolonged periods of quantitative easing — most recently to ease the economic pain of the coronavirus crisis — is “adding to inequality” by benefiting the people who own financial assets, says Chanos. He believes that the Federal Reserve ought to cut credit card rates for consumers, which are still 15-18 per cent in the US, and sees a potential political backlash against the central banks for their part in how “the rich have gotten much richer and the vast majority of people have not”.

Political risk is one of the reasons that Chanos is shorting gig economy comp­anies such as ride-hailing apps Uber and Lyft and online food-delivery platforms Grubhub and Just Eat Takeaway. Not only are they losing money, but he believes that there is going to be a greater political focus on low-wage workers, which poses an existential threat to their business models.


Chanos sits on the finance committee of US presidential hopeful Joe Biden, who is supporting a new California law to strengthen legal protections for gig economy workers. A Biden administration raises the prospect of higher taxes. “I think it’s fair that rates of taxation on capital probably should go up, relative to rates of taxation on earned income. I know that makes me a communist on Wall Street but I’ve always felt that.”


Chanos declines a second glass of wine, joking that “I don’t want to be drunk for this.” Defeated by his huge steak and salad, he asks the waiter to put them in a doggy bag. On my encouragement, he decides to be a good sport and orders the “decadent” fried Oreos that the restaurant is famous for. My own dessert is a coconut choc ice.


I return to the subject of Tesla, whose shares have surged around six-fold in the five years since Chanos began shorting the company. What is going on here? “I think Elon Musk has personified the hopes and dreams of this bull market,” he says, setting out his bear case against Tesla, which he sees as unprofitable, highly leveraged and facing increasing competition. Tesla “burnishes its results through aggressive accounting”, in his view. He also describes it as “a culture of deception” because it is selling self-driving to consumers, which as yet “doesn’t exist”.


What, I ask, is Chanos’s main motivation: to be rich or to be right?


“I want to do this until they pull me out of the seat,” he replies. When Wirecard filed for insolvency, there was “an electricity” that ran through Kynikos. “That keeps you going.” And so, he says, does his belief that “this market is setting up to be one of the great short opportunities of all time”.

BE CAREFUL HERE.Chanos thinks there's big problems ahead. Not exactly a controversial view right now. I was pointing out that despite running out of rope in terms of interest rates, and then QE, and then QE on  steroids, I'm looking for the next phase of MP, namely on the demand side, as primary indicator that impotence has arrived. At that point the next crash, after paving over and paving over, what you'll get is a massive sinkhole instead. I was also just pointing out that while yes, they have already gone down that road in terms of the so called stimulus checks, I don't really consider this included just because of circumstance. I expect it'll happen on a much larger scale as authorities grasp at straws. And in the US where market fundamentalism, particularly supply side,  is basically the state religion shifting to a demand side heavy approach is a solid indicator of desperation and the end of the line. Then I was merely commenting on the shorter term, which seems quite apparent with stagflation, but all that is still playing out in real time. We didn't and still don't know exactly how the pandemic is going to pan out. If the thing had just vanished already the economy would have been strongly overheated, but it's actually gone on longer that expected so now we're stretched, hence more so called stimulus on the way. That's basically the long and short of it. After this near term reflation, it's pretty obvious the market is going to move sideways or negative and likely stay that way for a while, hence stagflation, particularly if Trump's tax plan is revoked. What I'm saying is, they have another rabbit they can pull out of that hat. But after that, that's all she wrote folks. As it pertains to Chanos and shorts. The post 2009 environment is the worst possible scenario and it just got put on steroids. So of course when you have effectively negative rates, just think about it like when oil went negative, they theoretically had to pay to get the oil off their hands, that's the situation with money in that kind of environment, so it's not a surprise when you see the massive lets just be polite and say misallocation of capital. What Chanos is doing either takes some real conviction or perhaps some real insanity in a monetary environment like this. Especially with some of the lets say better known among his short positions. You combine ESG and basically fighting the fed, that's probably not going to end well, and it hasn't. By the sound of it the poor bloke might have lost his mind if wirecard didn't implode and hand him a win.Lol idk what the hell youre seeing or what tat notification even says (nothing?), but I just went to chrome, hit print to pdf

it’s uploaded to doc droid too so you don’t even need to download itThey said the same thing about the 70's. Vietnam War had incurred massive public debts and talk on the street was the dollar was dead. Then Nixon pulled out of the Bretton-Woods system and dismantled the gold standard. Dollar inflated massively in response as the US defaulted on its debts in everything but name. But the G5 came together and agreed to tame the beast of inflation together. Then Reagan was elected and soothed the heart of Wall Street with his supply-side economics. Soon after, Japan brought prosperity to the West with her cars and electronics. The Paris Accord brought dollar inflation again but this time it was intentional.  By the start of Japan's lost decade, America had already begun to usher in the age of the Internet.

Yes things look bleak today as told by the old guard but the normal is always new. We might get negative interest rates but digital currency will dismantle the lower zero bound to accommodate the new rules of money. The Age of Silicon will bring 5G, electric cars, autonomous driving, IoT and quantum computing, keeping growth one step ahead of debt. Renewables and graphene will rewrite the rules of energy. Entire unimaginable industries will spring up on the platform of autonomous driving & e-commerce. Single-aisle planes will cross the globe in one flight, bringing dominance to LCCs. Geopolitical alliances will shift with a world less dependent on oil, ushering in new risks & opportunities. Will the EU consolidate into America's most powerful ally or splinter into many benefactors of the One Belt One Road alliance? Will there be a world war with two hegemons, leaving the victor with all the spoils of war for the next century again? 

The heart of contrarinism is to predict what everyone else is missing. See all the possibilities in your mind, and you will never be surprised. See, I just made a Game of Thrones quote in an investing context.It will also make the dollar weaker on the world-stage making imports more expensive reducing domestic unemployment further reducing welfare and entitlement spending further.

ebin> It will also make the dollar weaker

Relative to what currency?Unskilled immigration is good for the market. Do you suppose that's why the business community supports it so much? Even the really right wing segments who pretend like they don't in public for cultural reasons, when it comes down to business they actually love it. It's both a source of cheap labour and it drives the cost of labour down in general. Oh did you think the system was set up with your best interests in mind, you meaning some working stiff? What are you smoking buddy? You working stiffs have to compete with that cheap source of labour. That's good for markets, bad for you, aka labour, aka working stiff. The fact that a ton of people are unemployed right now is bullish for the market. What matters is how long before the fundamental situation improve, but the fact that all those people were let go, ok, let's think this though, imagine they were not let go. Then what? The cost comes out of corporate balance sheets.  We have intense corporate socialism in the US so that would never happen, even with some EU like scheme. In the US the corporates get the cake and eat it too. They get similar loan/grants like EU, but they still laid off the workers. That's very bullish.  It's amazing how people can't comprehend these basic logics. Weaker dollar is also bullish for equities seeing as they are denominated in dollars. What do you think happened when the US dropped the gold standard and massively devalued the currency? The stock market exploded to the moon the very next day. The question is to what degree, that's the magic, the balancing act. But it's never perfect. If the thing goes on and on, we can get more stretched and that's bearish. If the thing goes away and we can re-open sooner, the sooner, like say already opened, they would have had to make moves to prevent inflation at that point because the economy would quickly over heat.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_moneyGot it.

You just argued unemployment is good for the market. No, it’s good for driving down wages but bad for the market overall as it reduces the number of consumers who buy products.MMT?No clue. I just report 'em as I see 'em.Why is there a exact copy of this reply in the same thread? Which one of you is a bot?> You write a lot without saying much of worth.

99% of macro discussions... in my experience 😂[deleted]MMT is misunderstood. It's just a framework for understanding monetary policy. It's basically just some updated "physics" for monetary policy. But the term is thrown around loosely. From my perspective, you're basically already engaged in policies which people tend to associate with MMT to one degree or another.  The only difference is the public proponents of MMT suggest getting that cash into hands of the people, ala Yang, UBI, etc. rather than the trickle down. People, especially the deficit hawk types, tend to think MMT proponents think you can just print till the cows come home, but I haven't actually seen anyone advocate that. A lot of what gets passed off as economics is just ideology, much of it not unlike religion.I actually posted it 4 times due to a bug in the reddit mobile app

It’s a pyramid scheme pretending to be a MLM.Responding to your quick edit. And? What's your point? That's your investment strategy? Relying on a market fundamentalist cult to take drastic anti-market regulatory actions all in the name of "public interest" or something silly like that? Stop smoking crack. Check your passport and remember where you are. I think you're forgetting something here. Was he right? This is past tense  isn't it? So Ackman scored right? Because hlf is clearly an illegal pyramid scheme. Oh wait. It hit all time highs last year and is well on it's way back. And yet you're still here, years later, fighting reality like it doesn't exist.You working stiff riff raffs are so delusional it's basically cute.K. All I said is I agreed with his hypothesis, he could have made a lot as well.Nothing to gain from being an arrogant dipshit dude.These guys are never gonna get the 7 nm chip down, are they? Seriously beginning to lose confidence in this management. There's a reason companies are moving away from x86 architectureTruly sounding like a "Swan" song I guessHopefully their "data-centric" strategy (still not sure what that means after spending hours reading) will work out.It's not really moving away because of node size in intel's fabs tho.  Mostly the benefits of ARM is power and performance compared to x86.  Also, RISC-V is the new open source kid on the block that cuts license fees out of product budgets.Intel is in serious trouble for the next 3+ years. But the die was cast a while ago when they didn't cut their losses on 10 nm because their x86 dominance didn't provide much of a sense of urgency (as opposed to say AMD at death's door). Remember that Swan got the position because nobody else would take it.

They make a ton of money today because of ecosystem inertia, OEM fear, brand, and a huge amount of 14nm process that has terrific margins so long as there's strong demand for 14 nm chips.

If the best x86 market segments want something more than their 14 nm CPUs, what are they going to do? 10 nm performance, margins, and volume suck. 7 nm, the savior, is looking really fuzzy right now.

So, AMD has a clear runway and strong product roadmap execution for the next 3+ years in x86 (never mind Su vs. Swan). TSMC is crushing them on process, capacity, and has no strategic incentive to help Intel until they're much weaker. Custom ARM and RISC-V are strong platform design threats (a lot of which will be built by TSMC).

Now that 7 nm has been officially recognized by Intel as being at risk, Swan got brutalized on the analyst call. Not really much anybody could have done but just take it since it's just something he inherited. But he'll likely get pounded on 10nm and 7nm for every quarter going forward for \*years\*. That's going to do wonders for the investment thesis and enterprise customer confidence.> this management

The CEO that screwed 10nm was BK, not Bob Swan.

Not saying Bob won't mess this one though...Data centers probably (large server farms owned by big companies). Server chips, optane stuff, they also make some decent network cards.Correct me if I'm wrong, but a lot of performance is achieved by packing more transistors into the same surface area right?That's a fair statement, I exaggerated. But Intel's integrated approach is seriously hurting them now compared to the past 30+ years though.

First it was mobile by thinking they could create more efficient x86 chips than manufacturing ARM chips for the iPhone and lost. Then they made the same decision on non general-purpose processors like graphics; the Larrabee architecture was a faux-graphics chip that was again based on x86 and was pretty shitty/didn't meet a lot of use cases needed for GPUs today. Intel didn't want to play in that market so they took a half-assed approach. You're right that x86 isn't completely going away, AMD is doing well with the x64 instruction set and at the 7nm scale. Now the Mac is likely moving to ARM.

RISC-V will definitely further chip away at overall market share though. Companies will use that architure vs pay the fees to intel for some newer use cases, especially as we move further into edge computing and IoT devices.

I don't have any recommendation to buy or sell intel but their management has been frustrating recently. If you have any further insight, I'd love to hear it.Yes and it's incorrect to say arm is higher performance than x86 anyway. Arm is higher performance per power (~flops/watt).

Also not sure I see many companies moving away from x86. I see a lot going to AMD but only a few shifting to an arm architecture.at some point power requirements overtake size and inefficiency occurs. We have already hit that, hence why 7nm is not great in practice.yes but dennards has broken down my guyI agree with you there.  Hardware market is becoming more domain specific with the rise of GPUs and other less dominant ASICs for applications like ML training or inference, specific DSP use cases, etc.  

As for investments, I dislike the direction intel took too.  I think the enduring long term investments would be the semiconductor fabs like TSMC or semiconductor equipment or service provisers like say ASML or teradyne.  I think this is what I believe but I'm am still not certain if this is a good allocation of capital.  Do you have any specific approaches to investment in semiconductor markets?The threat to x86 is that that the customers with the largest scale (Amazon, China) and/or integration benefits (Apple) have an incentive to design their own chip and have someone else fab them.

But a shrinking x86 market is still very juicy for AMD and TSMC but terrible news for Intel long-term.If you're trying this as a summer project accessible to "the everyday person", you might lose them on the more technical aspects of moats and potentials. 

Also I'm confused by this post. Are you asking a question about a system you're developing? Or are you showing us that you know these things? It's confusing. 

Taking the first paragraph as truth -- you're going to want to codify this into easy-to-fill answers. It's like Peter Lynch says -- if you can't explain it to a fifth grader, you don't know the business. 

Maybe make a 5th Grader Investor Summary. That exercise will help you understand the business on a deeper level and get away from the technical (non everyday person) language. 

Overall, a bit confused as to what you're looking for here.“Competition Demystified” by Bruce Greenwald, “Competitive Strategy” by Michael Porter, and “Measuring a Moat” by Michael Mauboussin (blog). 

It seems like you have a solid grasp over parts of competitive advantage analysis, but it’s be helpful to strengthen that understanding before setting out a framework for others. A good test to start by creating a framework for yourself to work off of, and then refine that with practice over time before adapting it to those who are less financially literate.

Good luck!is this a summary of a book or something? What is the question exactly? About whether that's a good framework?"Efficient Scale or toll moat: Only a few players can enter a market and be successful. Mastercard's competitors, namely Visa, have no interest in undercutting Mastercard as doing so would only hurt their profits and margins. Instead, they function in a healthy, stable duopoly to preserve their market share and profits. This grants high barriers to entry for any company trying to enter the payment network space."

Because of this Covid-19 pandemic, I can't run the student fund I usually run in person for the foreseeable future (I can manage the fund itself but communicating with new members, it's going to be difficult). I go to a Liberal Arts school and most students don't have a lot of exposure to investing but have a desire to learn about it.

I want to develop a framework for students/people to be able to analyze companies and share their ideas in a standardized form that encapsulates the overall research process online. Because it's online, I naturally would want it to expand it beyond my school hence this post.

If a person can understand the moats of a company or lack thereof, how they make money and how solid/protected are their revenue streams, the direction is the company going in, any obstacles and risks they may face, and a reasonable price to buy its shares, then its reasonable to say they understand the business and can make an informed decision on whether or not they want to invest in the company or not. 

This framework isn't meant to turn people into investment gurus or anything but people who are interested in investing should be able to actively participate in the research process and share that with each other. I just want to point them in a direction that could help them start the research process. By having a framework, it will force them to understand the business and therefore hedge against their emotions amidst the day-to-day volatility of the stock market and just focus on investing strong companies with durable moats for long periods of time. If they're wrong about the investment, they can understand where they went wrong and hopefully identify these weaknesses to exit in time. 

While investing certainly isn't for everyone, I believe that there should be more opportunities for people to learn about investing beyond its philosophy and actually dig into companies they buy from or can understand. Sure Peter Lynch (amongst other investors) has vouched that the individual investor has many advantages over a fund manager but not many people/college students are going to read a book to get started on investing. It's sad but true. You can argue that these people shouldn't invest but I just want to make investing more accessible and exciting for people.

Of course, if they're serious about investing they'll educate themselves, read books, find investment channels and this framework isn't meant to replace that.

I hope this clarifies both what I was trying to get at in my post and why I'm doing it.I should have made this clearer in my post. **I am trying to develop a "fill in the blank" framework and a platform to discuss for people who are interested in investing in stocks (want to learn to invest)**. I run an investment club in my college where many students are eager to learn how to invest in stocks but are intimidated by reading annual reports and the world of investing in general; I go to a liberal arts college and while there are econ majors we don't have finance majors so many people see investing as daunting/confusing/farfetched. What many of them don't realize is that their academic backgrounds and interests give them unique/valuable insights to many companies, but there is a huge mental (and knowledge) barrier for them when it comes to investing.

By developing a framework, I want to simplify the research process for both the person trying to analyze the company and the person on the other side reading the analysis and show that anyone can invest with the right mind and framework (that it isn't rocket science that only people in wall street can do). This is not too dissimilar from Morningstar's equity analyst reports but the goal is to have it more open-ended, simple, and user friendly. While there are many books that have touted this, I want to help students actually analyze, dissect, and discuss companies. 

I guess I have a few questions that I didn't make explicit. Do you think this framework can be used to help the everyday person a better, more informed investor? Is this an effective and universal enough framework to analyze an investment opportunity/company, especially for people who are just beginning to learn about investing even if they don't have any intentions to go into the industry?Since it's a duopoly, the customers have no alternative and therefore buy your service anyway. It's obviously an advantage for the 2 companies to have their prices "floored".I'd be inclined to argue what might be an unpopular perspective on this sub: investment into individual stocks is emphatically not something the average college student or graduate should ever be doing. 

My own personal opinion goes a good deal further - I'm bearish on whether there's any point in almost anyone trying to outperform the index - but even someone who disagrees with that perspective may well agree that nonspecialist undergrads should really not be trying to beat the market on the price of a given stock. 

The market is not perfect, and I would never claim that it is. But I do think that everyone would agree that there is a knowledge base below which a given individual has no business trading, and I'd argue quite forcefully that college students fall well below that threshold. In fact, I'd go further and argue that anyone who doesn't have at least a reasonable grasp of financial mathematics should be nowhere near trading shares.When would a non financial company file a B8 form?Yes but it would be so much to keep up with the marketAre you trying to put a course together?

How would your course be different then the other thousands of courses taught by CFA designation holders, masters, and Ph.d?

You say you have 5 WHOLE years and you watch Bloomberg ALL day, and you know how the stock market works?

I have 8 years of industry experience, hold the CFA designation, was a tutor in the CFA program, and work in asset allocation research, and I couldn't tell you how the markets work, not really. 

I work with, or have had the honour to be mentored by, brilliant people who have lived and worked for 30 to 40 years in the markets: they CAN'T tell how the markets work.Something related to ground source water heating or cooling . Energy companies would have to fill that one out for sure.I can’t tell u how stock prices will be today, tomorrow or after 6 months .

The only thing related to the stock market.Mortgage trust forms?You are not qualified to do videos.> IAC trades at a discount to asset value (cash + their publicly traded stake in ANGI) despite having an incredible track record of value creation. I can’t help but wonder if there’s some type of opportunity there; if the market is going to get excited about SPACs predeal and price them at a premium to cash value, why can’t IAC (and other companies with big cash balances) take advantage of that? It seems like it would be pretty easy: IAC could IPO a SPAC tomorrow. They could put $100m of their own cash into the SPAC (some into the founders shares, the majority just into normal SPAC units) and then raise as much capital from new investors as they could. That would create massive value for IAC: it would increase their war chest for deals, it would be (at worst) value neutral for their cash (at best, if the SPAC traded for a premium to cash, it would create some temporary value), and it would create huge economics for IAC (I’m assuming IAC would be the sponsor /founder and get the founders shares, so when they announced a deal they would capture tons of value for themselves). 

So the take away from his (lots of incorrect) rant about SPACs is that one of his "value" holdings should take advantage of the bubble. WeirdBrienne of Tarth completely destroys the arguments of the author, but thanks for sharing.Pretty sure this guy is wrong on the 20% piece he states. This guy assumes that companies are being bought with all cash (ie no debt) or no other partners in the deal. SPACs don't buy companies equal to the size of the IPO proceeds, it's 2-4x that amount, which dilutes the equity that management would get.IAC is great. Quality management and continually proving they execute. Trying to work out what to do post MTCH split still. All back into IAC?I want to create a SPAC and buy in-n-out. Who is down? Jk, but kinda hope Ackman is looking at that or someone. 

And yes i know, in-n-out is gonna say no.Are shareholders in the SPAC not equally diluted though?When SPAC’s take out debt and other PIPE financing are they only diluting management’s portion? I assumed the whole structure got diluted equally so management would still end up with their 20% cut. 

Not an expert on these by any means.I don't really follow this, can you explain?

I though it worked like this. Management pays like $25k and gets 10M founder shares. IPO investors pay $10 a share for 40M shares. 

At the time of the acquisition management shares are converted into regular shares, so shareholders now get diluted by that 20% amount? 

Why would leverage effect the situation, wouldn't all shareholders (including management) be affected the same way?IAC is my largest position now. Time will tell if this works out. I like them too.Haha, Ackman is looking at tech. At least that's what I took "mature unicorn" to mean...I think you're right if it's on the debt side, but if they find others to co-invest with, obviously their equity gets diluted

I just found this thread from a few days ago that goes in-depth about SPACs. Great read in the comments! https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/hthocd/thoughts_on_spacs_some_of_the_big_funds_im/Any particular reason you like IAC beyond what the article talks about? I can't tell what to make of the article, comments here and on the article itself indicate the author gets a lot wrong so not sure what to think of itIn-n-out is probably the most recession proof of all lol.  I assumed tech also.They are the best at acquiring internet companies and developing them to their fullest potential.  They just keep harvesting know-how from running their entire portfolio and have a perpetual edge (grow their properties as quickly as possible and acquire any worthy competitors before they pose a threat).  Being the biggest means they get the best media deals by way of purchasing power and will be able to buy the most relevant traffic at the lowest CAC.  Having groomed so many properties with explosive growth means they have a fixed handle on exactly what metrics are most pertinent and have a proven regimen to guarantee just the right amount of governance to promote success without stifling the operators.  Barry Diller is one of the greats and I would bet on him without reservation.https://twitter.com/Dan_Roller/status/1279493455777984512?s=20

This twitter thread says it better than I can. Which also demonstrates my lack of independent thinking as well

In my own words I see them somewhat similar to a Berkshire type entity except that: similar to what Ackman said his issue was- IAC is much more nimble. But also  differently in the sense that their hand is in fast growth internet space, which I personally like much better. 

And yes what everyone else says about their anti-conglomerate playbook.Can you think of any tech companies that would be interesting for him to purchase?Well saidImpressive. For every one dollar revenue that FB generated, 39 cents went into the coffersIt's certainly not something I take lightly.

The Central Government in China is making clear with its' decisions, most recently the decision to hold the upcoming IPO of Jack Ma's Ant Group on Chinese exchanges exclusively, that it wishes to reduce and minimize China's reliance upon the USA's economy. At the same time, the Government in the United States is taking a confrontational stance towards China both legislatively and economically as it negotiates the political and economic reality of China's burgeoning superpower status.

These two facts suggest that the period of relatively close economic ties enjoyed by China and the US may be coming to a close. In my view, this may have an effect on neighbouring countries in East and South Asia, who may benefit from an uptick in demand for manufacturing and other services from the USA. Whether this demand can be capitalized upon depends on if the construction and creation of infrastructure and regulatory structures can be implemented effectively in those countries. China, in its' current position as a transitioning economy, may outsource a part of its' domestic production to Africa, an area of the world where it has significant financial interest, and may attempt to transition to a service-based economy serving it's growing middle and upper classes by reducing its' reliance on the manufacturing sector.

Regarding issues such as social unrest, political instability and COVID-19, it's my unfortunate view that China is in many ways more adequately equipped to counter these threats than the USA. China has a very extensive and pervasive system of state control and surveillance, both economically and socially, which enables it to be very decisive with its' policy creation. The Chinese people are also generally patriotic and fairly nationalistic, preferring a 'strong' China with a resolute leader to a free and democratic China. The Chinese Government has an easier time enacting policy, and has an easier time convincing its' people to obey and support that policy - this is useful, for example, for enforcing the wearing of masks and social distancing. It also has more effective means of surveillance and a less accountable police force and legal system, which makes the suppression of political dissidents less cumbersome than in the USA, where principles of fairness and justice come before the well-being of the State.

There's also the issue of military aggression from the Chinese side, against India on the border and against their disputed territories in the South China Sea. Tensions flaring in these regions, as well as the presence of Chinese neo-colonialism in Africa, indicates China's desire to spread both its' physical borders and its' political and financial influence independently of the USA. This may have the effect of dividing political and financial allegiances globally between the USA and China, as countries weigh up their options and decide which global superpower offers them the most in exchange for the least.I think it's awesome actually. China has become the world's manufacturer and that needs to change.This will likely lead to more nationalistic actions and policies to bring supply chains back to the  home continent. IMO, along with the increased monetary and fiscal stimulus funded by the FED potentially leading to widespread increased spending and potential economic recovery in the next year or so, the anti-globalization policies have the risk of spurring inflation in the mid-term future (2-3 years out). I am allocating a portion of my portfolio to precious metals and some miners to protect it against this possibility.Invest in MexicoRising tension with China => higher inflation in the future. China is really the one major force that has suppressed global inflation since the 1970s. We should expect a return to 1970s era high inflation if China leaves the USD sphere.

Also, rising distrust between countries means that the USD as a trusted medium of exchange between nations is on its way out. Most likely global trade will revert to at least a partial gold standard.

Bottom line is, buy gold.Manufacturing shift to India and SE asia already starting. Cold War with China has already been going on 20 years. It’s just now US is fighting backI’m avoiding talking about whether I think the actions of the US are right or wrong and just focusing on the likely outcomes.

Overall it will lead to some form of de-globalisation which will result in higher inflation, which is both good and bad. Companies that can pass on costs to consumers, normally that would be utilities (regulation dependent), consumer durables, commodities, and residential, will benefit. Other companies may suffer due to decreasing margins where they aren’t able to pass on costs. Higher costs also means lower demand, in the aggregate, for an economy unless employment can be kept high with commensurate wage growth. 

Long term, higher inflation will also lead to higher interest rates, which will punish companies that are over levered, but that’s maybe 2+ years down the road. 

If governments are able to boost demand via fiscal stimulus then it could still be good for stocks overall, but if they don’t I.e. because Politicians can’t agree on a plan, then you may see stagflation as we had in the 70’s.Read Ray Dalio's "Changing World Order" articles on LinkedIn. Great insight into this exact question.

He seems to be advocating for diversification into stocks ex-USA, as well as for gold purchases and alternative asset hedges.

TL;DR from a portfolio management perspective: buy gold and diversify away from US. Buy a little into China and stay far away from bonds and cash.

My 2c: look at emerging market economies with close ties to China if you are hesitant to buy direct Chinese.Trump will slowly increase nationalistic anti-China sentiments.

Right before the election some big move will be done to seemingly piss off China (coordinated with them, of course). Everyone will be happy, markets will tank a little, which will be perceived as a necessary pain, but ultimately Trump will be re-elected, and over time will roll back/scale down that "big punishment for China".

TL;DR: prepare for a move down before the election.I would be very wary about investing in companies who are dependent on Chinese consumers for top-line growth (sbux, for instance). If relations really take a turn, China just doesn't have much to lose by excommunicating American firms who skim profits off their growing middle class without actually investing in the supply chain that made the middle class possible in the first place.While I advocate a more forceful approach with China, I also hope we enter the conflict with our eyes open.

US-USSR Cold War never became hot because both countries were run by mature adults who experienced the horrors of WW2. This is not the case with today's US (Trump...) and China, with its "wolf diplomacy" idiocy.

Everyone talks about a new Cold War with China. But without the Greatest Generation to guide us, I fear not a repeat of the Cold War, but a repeat of the conditions that led to WW1.It’s about time. Their human rights abuse and slave labor needs to end. America and the rest of the world needs to treat them the same way we did the Soviet Union. They’re directly responsible for hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths from a disease they hid from the rest of the world before it was too late. Shame on CCP. 

**Edit: Downvoted by the reddit paid CCP bots... not surprised 🙄**I want to know if the US decide to stop honoring their protection of sea travel. As of right now the US protect all sea travel and we not getting any benefit out of it.

While we were, and some probably are, in denial for so long, China has been waging a multi front war again us. They have been forcing our companies to give up intellectual properties & trade secret. They have been stealing our technologies & design. And they have been using their cheap labors to make copy of our companies' products at cheaper price, pushing our companies out of business.I think it's ultimately going to lead to Europe, China and Japan becoming cozy bedfellows leaving the US to scramble to find someone else to supply raw materials, chemicals and electronics. Bullish for China, neg for US and mildly positive for Europe.All that China needs to do is dump dollar from its reserve and we are done for.China is gonna have to retool a bunch of manufacturing plants to their own consumption demands because im sure they dont need mardi gra beeds to be made.

The whole premise of the nation is colonialism (of native american lands) and capitalistic inequality.Good points but I noticed you used the word "democratic" in your analysis, was it intentional? 

Just curious given the steady stream of events and the actions taken by their government it appears farthest from the truth.

Besides this I do think you have valid points in there.

If manufacturing moves to other low cost of production locations, then the effect is the same as when manufacturing was in china, no?I’ve been reading his posts too, what’s your take on the likelihood we see the USD no longer being a reserve currency? I feel like the only way that comes to fruition is if we get negative rates or high inflation leading to capital outflows and a stagflation type setup in the US causing others to lose confidence in the stability of the currency.

I like you’re idea; I’m hesitant with Chinese companies directly just with the lack of regulation there seen most recently with the Luckin Fraud.To be fair, while China downplayed Covid-19, silenced whistleblowers, and engaged in a cover-up, the United States failed to take the threat seriously. Intelligence reports on the looking threat were documented in the presidential policy book. Though they hid the extent and scope of the disease, the Chinese did not hide the lethality of the disease prior to outbreaks devastating global business. This was exposed in Peter Navarro's memo. 

I agree on the get tough on China stance since I view China as an ideological threat which a male-centric population, and a nation that abuses it's position. Yet, Covid-19 was likely an accident and the world was caught off guard by this evolving threat. Moreover, the United States has been singularly ill-prepared, which, though it pre-dates the current administration, has been hampered by anti-science denialism & American arrogance.  Americans have a perverted idea of freedom, while China admittedly has no idea what freedom is. 

US Covid-19 deaths ≠ China's fault[deleted]Nobody is forcing our companies, whom should have kept IP secured within our borders and hired domestically instead of outsourcing,  to do business with China.That would result in Monroe Doctrine 2.0 wouldn’t it for the USA? I think the key to US fortunes post 2050 is how developed a North, and maybe South A,Eric an sphere is.You’d be surprised; there was a Bloomberg article on this last year and they dumped 25% of their dollar reserves over the past few years and nothing happenedNot going to happen and fears of a loss of reserve currency status are unfound and frankly wrong.  China needs USD.  Period.  And nothing in the near-term is going to change that.  When looking at global alternatives to a reserve currency, there are none currently and there are none in the future.  A gold standard is not going to happen.Well, they can start moving the factory to africa or SEA and continuing accepting order from their former customer, but this time not Made in China, eventhough it is still owned by China.

I dont how feasible is that.

But i am reading that many chinese who own recycle center start investing abroad when government decide to ban import of plastic waste.Hope you are writing that from outside the US.

If you are writing that from AC room on your laptop in USA you are a raging hypocriteThis is counterfactual. The USA has a strong legal foundation and an independent judiciary. China, on the other hand, has a rubber-stamp court system with a 99% conviction rate. One of these countries clearly places more value upon the principles of fairness and justice than the other.

Although I don't disagree with you when it comes to the abhorrent treatment of Indigenous people in the British Colony countries historically, it should be noted that every empire in the world has been expansionist - from the Mongol Empire to the Ottoman Empire and countless others. The entire world as we know it is formed from the repeated rapid growth and recession of expansionist empires - it's not just the USA that was formed this way. To levy this criticism at the USA and not at, say, the Arab world that was built off the back of 10 centuries of African enslavement, displays a clear double standard in your thinking.

Capitalistic inequality, as you put it, is the driving force behind human development. The idea that one should receive a superior reward for a superior contribution is called meritocracy, and it's not an idea I find too much fault with if I'm to be honest. If we were all exactly the same, with the same assets and the same net worth, why would anybody try to excel, to innovate, to stand out? It's one of the problems they faced in the Soviet Union - how do you inspire people to excel and innovate, if those innovations are not rewarded? There's also the risk and reward argument, which states that we should demand greater compensation for taking more risk. Since any entrepreneurial venture is risky by its' nature, those undertaking entrepreneurial ventures must be motivated by the prospect of greater reward. Why would any rational person take the risk of innovating - that is, taking the risk of losing everything to advance humanity - if they were offered no reward for this undertaking? They may as well simply stay in their secure and stable job and not take the risk. Financial equality, in this sense, would stifle innovation and growth.Reread the sentence. He did not imply china was democratic.> The Chinese people are also generally patriotic and fairly nationalistic, preferring a 'strong' China with a resolute leader to a free and democratic China.

I was actually pointing out that China is undemocratic, and expressing the view that a lack of democracy is a sacrifice a large share of the Chinese population are willing to make in return for strength of leadership.Somebody reads/listen to Peter Zeihan.Because there are a lot of kids in other poorly run and abusive countries that need jobs too."Century of the Dragon"

You're free to take your moralizing to /r/politics or maybe /r/humanrightsIn the scenario of a Cold War II, I expect China to win. The US has little chance of winning a long term confrontation with China at this point, so it's a dumb idea to start one.

The American political class at this point are like the Soviet leadership in the 1970s. They are unimaginative and bound by ideological rigidities. The domestic political trend of the US is toward becoming a Latin American style country. This country will not be structurally capable of competing with China.I think you're going to see more supply chain diversification in other low-cost labor countries rather than a manufacturing return to the USYou have to consider, why is so much manufacturing being done in China right now. Why not India? Why not African countries? Many of these other countries have much lower prevailing wages than China.

There are many costs, because there are many inputs to manufacturing. Labor is simply one input, and it is an increasingly minor input in manufacturing. Depending on the particular product, the cost of capital, energy, logistics, and supply chains can be much more decisive than labor costs. 

China is low cost because of a combination of many factors. Chinese labor is no longer cheap, but it is comparable in quality to that of developed countries while being cheaper than developed countries. Eastern China has better infrastructure than most developed countries, this gives Chinese manufacturers some of the lowest logistic costs in the world. China has a domestic abundance of capital and savings, this gives China a massive cost of capital advantage over every other developing country. An example of this is the Shanghai Gigafactory. The government of Shanghai was able to finance most of the factory and offer Tesla a turnkey factory without any up front capital investment from Tesla. Most developing countries that have to pay a cost of capital >6-10% can't afford to do this.

The really major one is supply chain costs. If you manufacture in India, but all your component inputs still have to be imported from China, you will incur higher supply chain risk and cost which will eat into your labor cost savings. Attempting to replicate the supply chain locally will require massive up front capital investment, and India has a much higher cost of capital than China.

In practice what this means is that China can manufacture things for cheaper than countries with far lower wages. Chinese products can undersell African producers with wages that are 1/5 of prevailing Chinese wages due to the greater internal supply efficiency in China. A worker in Senegal that makes $100/month isn't as cost efficient as a worker in China that makes $700/month.

China's high savings rate and cheap capital means that China can upgrade its capital stock far more cheaply than poorer countries. The rise of automation actually makes Chinese manufacturers more competitive relative to poorer developing countries. At the same time, the size of the internal supply chain makes China more competitive than smaller countries with less population. The cost of labor makes China more competitive than developed countries with higher wages.

It is a combination of these factors that makes Chinese factories sit at the sweet spot of factors that give them the lowest production costs across a very wide range of manufactured products. Moving manufacturing out of China will mean giving up many of these advantages. Diversifying supply chains across countries increases risk and cost. For example, during the COVID-19 crisis, cross border movement of people was shut down. Many factories in Vietnam rely on access to Chinese managers and technicians to function. With borders shut down, these people can't go to Vietnam, so the Vietnamese factories had to shutdown and the orders had to be given to factories in China. Every time you cross a national border, you are subject to an extra layer of border controls, customs, tariffs, and political risk. These all add to the cost of the final product.

What is really special about China is that it has a work force that is larger than the previously industrialized world put together, so it is able to absorb a massive number of different types of manufacturing because it has enough workers. When you put all these different types of manufacturing in the same country, it drastically cuts the frictional costs of combining the outputs of these intermediate producers. The only other country with comparable work force size is India, but India internally does not all speak the same language. India has 22 official languages internally, and the largest one, Hindi, is spoken only by 43% of the population. So in practice, even India can't match the economy of scale of China, since no single language community within India has the scale to compete with the Mandarin speaking population of China.

The more technically sophisticated manufacturing becomes, the more important the size of your language community. You need to be able to communicate increasingly sophisticated technical concepts effectively with a wide network of suppliers, and doing so across a language barrier sharply reduces communication efficiency.China used to subsidize production industry. This allows for cheaper prices than any unregulated economy could have, they would need to turn a profit. Also issues of scale and logistic infrastructure.Because their currency doesn't float they are eating the world's inflation to keep their currency pegMy thoughts are much the same. I tend to think the decline of the USD as the reserve currency is still a good number of years away - I believe it'll probably be a pretty gradual replacement.

I'm cautious too of Chinese firms given the regulatory issues, but I've not given it much more thought than that. I'm bullish on S. Korean equity, Turkey, some Indian sectors, S. Africa, but I'll definitely be keeping an eye on China's offshore investment policy.Are you worried about German companies too given WirecardBefore you go on your anti America rant don’t forget 500 Thousands have died outside of America because China hid the virus and didnt let WHO tell everyone what was going on.

>he entire world as we know it is formed from the repeated rapid growth and recession of expansionist empires

Glad you agree on some points. However people do come from places. E.g. English people come from English. They are the original people of English (mixed with some nords and germans). No case can be made they "colonised" England. So no not everywhere is a result of "expansionist" empires. And in cases of Mexico and South American countries, because the locals have mixed with colonizers you can't call the average mexican a spanish invader of their own land because they're mixed. And most important locals in these countries who are 100% indigenous are treated perfectly well and have no discrimination placed upon them.

>To levy this criticism at the USA and not at, say, the Arab world that was built off the back of 10 centuries of African enslavement

No double standard. Arabs have blood on their hands and should be treated as the scum they are. However now they're not powerful. They're not much more than a bunch of racist oil dealers.

>Capitalistic inequality, as you put it, is the driving force behind human development. The idea that one should receive a superior reward for a superior contribution is called meritocracy

Nobody said capitalism doesn't ultimately work in some form. It just doesn't create a fair environment when it's not done right. The US with all the shitty L-O-B-B-Y-I-N-G that allows rich folks to buys laws and buys politicians, fake news media monopolies reporting absolute nonsense (and not the news) is not capitalism done right. It's capitalism shoved down people's throats with some date-rape drug.Thanks for the clarification ... perhaps i misunderstood!Peter Zeihan is a hack.

So China (currently) lacks a blue navy - is the US going to start blocking oil shipments to China? No.I mean you can say the same thing about America... why shouldnt that change too

America has more good jobs than anywhere else in the worldI hate authoritarian commies too, but let's not begrudge the hundreds of millions who were lifted out of dirt poor poverty. I've seen parts of the world that are like that, and no one should have to live like that. 

Our hope was that with greater business ties and economic liberalization would come political liberalization, clearly that didn't pan out. 

Fuck the CCP with a rusty metal crowbar.We did it to break them from the Soviets.,....and unless you’re talking a selective embargo, full embargo is where nukes are legitimately on the table given China’s food and energy position. If you’re saying that you’re betting on lack of a delivery vector they could land against the US, I’d disagree but could follow your reasoning. If not, it seems just as out there as when the PLA talks about ramming carriers with cruisers.

Personally, I don’t see why it matters that they are authoritarian. It’s not like we’ve followed that line before and we probably would have saved lives if we’d been willing to accept a more authoritarian leader in Iraq or Afghanistan instead of the Iranian puppets or tame dogs we got instead. Plenty of our democratic allies like Taiwan and Korea got their start as democracies in name only while actually being military dictatorships. The real issue is that the US is having to deal with the fact that it should have done steps to block China’s more aggressive actions 10-20 years ago instead of our strange obsession with bombing people in mud huts.[removed]I wonder why you’re so butthurt. Anyway, perhaps you should work on your reading comprehension. The first half of my comment was nothing political, it clearly stated that certain countries could fill the vacuum left by China. The second part is part and parcel of what’s required from good corporate responsibility standards before investing. A good political system is also required for safe and sustainable long term investments and having a good supply of labour (perhaps the Uighurs would make great employees).India is a disaster of public official corruption and caste privilege. That’s why India is a third world nation despite its intellectual and cultural depth. India can’t plausibly compete with China without major reforms. The US will have to start scrounging for suppliers of its consumer goodsChina will face massive headwinds due to their changing demographics. By 2100 their population is expected to be halved.This is assuming their pegged rate is far from what would be the floating rate, correct? Also it's not truly pegged, the yuan still flucatesYes, at least half a million known Covid-19 fatalities outside the US, which of course includes China itself. China has also destroyed evidence of original virus samples. They tried to put a lid on the virus, and downplayed it's severity, while failing to stop the spread. Sound familiar? These pandemic is the peeling back of establishment resilience in all walks of life. It has its own logic. The WHO parroted Chinese Communist statements in the early days. 

That said, I won't pretend that the USA handled this virus well. That is a lie. And the numbers - US leading in cases and fatalities - shows that to be the case. You have to ask why, however uncomfortable the truth may be. We literally had the intelligence we needed to prevent mass death. That requires political capital. Not this is the new Democrat "hoax" right-wing bullshit.[deleted]That's called an unfair deal, that does not mean forcing.  They still have a choice not to do business with China.  We would not be in this mess if those companies invested domestically or with a country that is not China.That’s true big reason why China selling USD has no impact is due to strong foreign capital inflows keeping our rates down. If that ever changes we’re in troubleYou didn't answer his question. Don't pollute this space with r/politics level garbage.We just don't make much anymore. Everything is farmed out to lower cost countries. As it should be really. Competitive advantage and such. I just think the concentration in China needs to be diversified from a political and economic perspective.It is not our responsibility to uplift them. That is their task.  
  
You need to take care of yourself first so that you are able to take care of your family so that your family has the capacity to produce more than they consume so that things get better not worse so that you can help your community so that your community can help others on and on until your nation is helping other nations.  
  
In the event of the loss of cabin-pressure, put your mask on first.How am i butthurt lol

I'm just saying there are forums for you to go moralize but this is not one of them.This isn't India's only problems either. India at this point is turning into a Hindu Fascist state. It will have unending problems with its own Muslim population.

India will not have the requisite domestic political stability to really focus on economic growth. Choosing Hindu Nationalism is a big mistake for the Indian government.It's impossible to predict what demographics will look like in 80 years. The best we can do is predict 1 generation ahead.

The main cause of low fertility in China in the present generation is compressed urbanization. A lot of people shifted from rural to urban living without sufficient time to accumulate capital first. Urban cost of living is far higher than rural cost of living, so this suppresses fertility among first generation "immigrants".

This will likely change in subsequent generations. Those who are too poor to get married won't have kids. Those who have kids generally only have one. Their kids will inherit a ton of assets from the accumulation of the previous generation. When 2 people who are only children get married, they inherit the combined assets of both families. This wealth will enable them to start families much earlier and have more children than their parents generation.

I expect Chinese population demographic trends to reverse in about 20 years due to this wealth effect. The rate of wealth accumulation right now in Chinese families is extremely rapid due to the 4-2-1 family structure.

In both China and US, realized fertility is lower than desired fertility. The main constraint is financial. Many women cannot afford to have as many children as they want due to financial constraints. Yet middle class Chinese are accumulating wealth much faster due to the higher rate of economic growth and also the lower current fertility. This means that the financial constraints on realized fertility will improve much faster in China than in the US. If you look at median wealth per adult (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_wealth_per_adult), the gap between US and China is much smaller than the gap in income, and it will close much sooner than the gap in per capita income.Yes the precise term is dirty float.  I think it's save to assume it's very unlikely that the yuan is correctly trading where it would be under a free float. Just look at the massive foreign currency holdings the Chinese central banks has and has held over time...A lot of other countries took the early warnings from China and dealt with the threat much better than the US. It is simply a lie that they didn’t let WHO know what was happening. The US and some European countries simply spent more time discrediting WHO, and spinning it against China than actually preparing for the virus. 

I’m not from China but where I’m from we a) have had news reports about the virus dating back to February and b) started taking action in April (though my workplace closed the offices in March). It is mind boggling when people say that you can’t trust the numbers from China, which implies that it could be worse, but then proceed to not take any steps towards preparing when China was telling the rest of the world to do so.

China invited WHO early on to deal with the virus, due to their failure in dealing with SARS, but that was being called out as WHO being bought out by China. So if you don’t trust China, and you can’t trust WHO, what would you have expected to happen in your country?

You talk about the ideological threat that China poses and while rightly so many other countries aren’t striving to be a one party dictatorship, no one thinks that US is truly democratic either. If anything US vs China will go down in history as a cautionary tale for drinking too much of your own Kool aid.The only NPC is you kiddo. I said we need to treat them like soviet union and gave actual reasons backing up why we need to do that. All of that is relevant to the discussion of tensions with ccp and how we should move forward with them. Now let me take a wild guess you have major case of TDS too, right?High debt, political instability and deep recession will get us there soon.This is counterfactual.  
There is more manufacturing in the US than ever right now (and this was true in the 10's, 00', 90, & 80's.)  
However much more manufacturing went overseas than was added domesticately decade after decade for the last sixty years.  
2B people were uplifted out of poverty but China become a world power and we gave away a ton of wealth and power to them.  
They use that wealth and power to influence our politicians and policies - even our celebrities.  
Remember when the NBA dared to say Free Hong Kong?The proper insult is to wish they purchase tesla stock.But lower fertility is a global phenomenon.

Why should china suddenly have above 2,1 kids per family?

The us is able to attract skilled immigrants from all over the world. China? Less so.Good point. Need to look no further than some currencies that trade on the black market> we a) have had news reports about the virus dating back to February and b) started taking action in April (though my workplace closed the offices in March).

There were worldwide reports even earlier than that, maybe mid/early January. I remember specifically because I was living in Asia at the timeIt is definitively clear that China was not as transparent as they could have been in the earliest days. I know senior people at WHO (I am writing this comment from Geneva, actually) and while they give high marks to China's cooperation with them after early January, they will admit - only in private, because of the politics - that China made some serious mistakes early (in late December and the first few days of January) that did serious damage to the pandemic response.

The most clear example of China's misdeeds was its shutting down all domestic travel out of Hubei, but allowing international flights to operate without restriction and spread the virus around the world. This decision was straight up psychopathic.Truth is I'm much more terrified of a Dominant China rolling tanks into India or land troop ships in Taiwan than I am of the US getting involved in any dispute.  Trump has called to pull troops out of Afghanistan and as far as I'm concerned that is a good sign.


China has demonstrated its willingness to do what's best for China at the expense of literally any group, country, religion, or any other idea.  A destabliszed US means there is no counter balance to aggressive Chinese expansion.  It is a precarious world we find ourselves though, not the worst it's ever seen.Lower fertility isn't a global phenomenon. Scandinavian fertility rates bounced back after hitting bottom in the 80s. Fertility rates are related to median wealth levels in developed countries. The faster your middle class accumulates wealth, the faster your fertility rates will bounce back.

I doubt the US will be able to attract skilled immigrants in net from around the world for much longer. I myself have emigrated from the US because the US is becoming unlivable. Cost of living in the US is becoming insane, especially for families.

Among my close relatives, half of my generation (mid-30s) have already left the US and permanently settled abroad. More and more young Americans will start leaving in search of better deals abroad.

One thing I think is important to note is the difference between fertility within marriage and fertility outside of marriage. In the US context, fertility outside of marriage should basically be discounted because without a Scandinavian style welfare state, single motherhood almost guarantees poverty and poor social outcomes for the children. These people are just as likely to contribute to the future prison population as well as to the future work force.Yes I think so, but I was hesitant to state that because I don’t think anyone even paid attention to that. It only really became news I would say in early February, when it was only in China and Japan I believe.I don’t think it’s fair to think that they ought to shut down the entire country on day one if this is a novel virus. In hindsight sure, but even if China were more open by a few weeks or even months, the US response was to deny that the virus was even real so would it really have changed a thing?

Of course one can argue that if they China dealt with the virus earlier then it would have been contained, but I don’t think that the international community at large should rely on this as a strategy for dealing with pandemics. 

I think my point here, if the virus didn’t start in China, trade war and all, it would’ve been less politicised. If it started in Country X, not a political enemy of the US, and we keep all things the same they took 1-2 months to really get the word out, the US would at the very least not attack WHO.

The US did more harm both to themselves and the world by discrediting the WHO, which continues to today, and to de-platform Dr Fauci, despite the whole situation getting worse. And they did all this not interest of US citizens but to spite a political enemy.

Also to think that we are comparing China’s lack of transparency vs the US administrations outright lies that the virus is a hoax. I do believe that the local Chinese governments had incentive to withhold information but once the central government got wind of it, their action has been rather effective. Years from now, we’d still be debating if the virus is a hoax...that is hindsight bias in action.

As CEO of automotive company for example, you won't recall every single variant of certain car just because there is 1 complaint about a malfunctioning brake. You have to make sure first whether it is reporting error, car owner's mishandlings, batch production error, or total disaster from initial system design. 

This is a country with 1.4 billion population. You can't expect them to shut down the entire country just because 1 or few report of strange new diseases.>	The most clear example of China's misdeeds was its shutting down all domestic travel out of Hubei, but allowing international flights to operate without restriction and spread the virus around the world. This decision was straight up psychopathic.

True, but at the same time, I remember reading articles about this as it happened. There is no reason other countries had to keep accepting flights from Hubei, seeing that China wasn’t even allowing them internally due to pandemic risk.

How many countries actually did this? And even when they did (US), there was a delay of weeks.The Us has a much longer track record of invading foreign countries compared to China tbhFertility rates in Denmark and Sweden are still below replacement levels.

Compare China to the us with regards to attraction highly skilled workers. I know it is fun to shit on the us currently however America still has massive soft power compared to China.

If I had to pick a winner by 2100 I would call the us a slight favorite.This is delusional, fertility and wealth are inversely correlated. I'm not sure how the anecdotes prove anything, the US still drains the brains of other nations much more than the oppressive Han state of China.> I don’t think it’s fair to think that they ought to shut down the entire country on day one if this is a novel virus. In hindsight sure, but even if China were more open by a few weeks or even months, the US response was to deny that the virus was even real so would it really have changed a thing?

Why are you all reading my comment this way? I didn't ever write anything like this at all.

In fact your understanding is basically the exact opposite of my point:

China *did* take very strong internal measures to stop travel out of Hubei. They simultaneously chose to apply *no* measures to travel out of Hubei to international destinations. This differential is indefensible. If Hubei was so bad that they had to lock it down internally, they should have locked it down externally too.It seems you have either failed to read - or failed to understand - my comment.

The point I am making is that China *did* take **very** strong internal quarantine measures very quickly with respect to internal travel. They shut down all travel from Hubei very, very early.

But they did not apply these measures to international travel, because that was someone else's problem. They were happily allowing international flights to leave Hubei while simultaneously locking down internal travel.

That is psychopathic to an incredible degree.In no small part because Trumps' nativist bullshit has turned closing borders into a political issue.And yet life is objectively better with the United States at the helm. We dont outright attack the borders of countries like India or threaten countries like Taiwan on a daily basis.  Chinese dominance would usher in a dystopian age."Fertility rates in Denmark and Sweden are still below replacement levels."

This is because their economies stagnated. Fertility trends are starting to reverse in Denmark and Sweden due to economic setbacks in the aftermaths of 2008. Nevertheless, their fertility trends disprove the idea that rising incomes correlate with lower fertility.

Even within the US, lower fertility is positively correlated with recessions. If rising incomes correlated with lower fertility, you would expect fertility rates to be inversely correlated with the economic cycle.

American soft power at this point exist only in the minds of American exceptionalists. In the rest of the world, the US is a laughing stock at this point.Fertility and wealth are definitely not inversely correlated. Desired fertility is largely independent of wealth, while realized fertility is enabled by wealth.

My anecdotes are simply intended to show that smart people are starting to abandon the US, and that the future will not be like the past. At some point the US will have a net brain drain flowing outward.Again this is easier said in hindsight. Imagine the international backlash “China kidnaped Americans and trap them in (fake) virus laden city”. Remember, this is probably the same time when the US was criticising a) welding down gates like the authoritarian rulers they are and b) building makeshift hospitals in a manner of days because all Chinese are enslaved or something.

The US does a great job of believing how bad it is and how fake the virus is simultaneously, depending on what fits the narrative you want to portray. So of course you can ban international travel, if you are brave enough.Again, it is such a hindsight bias.

Imagine if China, in the middle of trade war suddenly forbid international and any westerner or tourist in general trapped in Hubei, because of "unknown diseases".

People like you can only see "china bad". But hindsight bias is real whether you like it or not.No, you guys only invade countries like Cuba, overthrow legitimately elected governments like in Iran and Chile and outright occupy countries like Iraq and Vietnam... i could go on

I don't see why what the Chinese is doing is worse. Also why is China at fault for the issue with India? You can just as easily argue that the Indians were the aggressors...?There haven’t been a single year since 1980 with a danish birth rate at 2,1 or above.

It might be rising but it is not 2,1.

Lastly America has a lot of soft power. How many Chinese songs have you listened to lately? How many movies have you seen?

Talented engineers are not going to stay away from attractive jobs in America in 2050 because of trump. Furthermore if global talent is deterred due to human rights violations I doubt that they will prefer China.

Nevertheless China is expected to have their population half by 2100. They need to get rich before they get old. It will be interesting to see how they will handle this? Will they allow for hundreds of millions of migrants (and where are they supposed to come from?).

Here is the newest estimate:

https://www.google.dk/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-53424726

The Lancet study predicts that China's population will peak at 1.4 billion in four years' time before nearly halving to 732 million by 2100.

Official data showed the country's birth rate had fallen to its lowest level in 70 years in 2019.

Some fear that the country is a "demographic time bomb", which will see a smaller working-age population having to support a bigger, retired population. As one of the world's biggest economies, this would have global ramifications>At some point the US will have a net brain drain flowing outward.

Wishful thinking and fortune telling.

>  Fertility and wealth are definitely  not inversely correlated. Desired fertility is largely independent of  wealth, while realized fertility is enabled by wealth.

Very simply they are, for whatever reason, we see replacement fertility rates very low for developed nations, high for undeveloped nations. Desired fertility is a rather wishy-washy measurement compared to actuality and the revealed economic preference of greater wealth reducing family size. The only confounder I've found is Israel.Why do you all keep fixating on the optics of the relatively tiny number of foreign expats? That's not what I'm fucking talking about, I'm talking about the many **Chinese citizen nationals** who were permitted to fly out of Wuhan to international destinations while simultaneously being prohibited from traveling within China. China could have permitted foreigners to leave while preventing its own nationals from leaving, and that would have done a great deal to slow the initial spread out of Wuhan.

At the very least, China could have been open that there was extreme risk on flights coming from Wuhan to international destinations, which was clearly its assessment given that it banned those flights internally. If other nations had known how wild the pandemic was in Wuhan, and that China had stopped internal travel, they would have had more information to justify applying strict quarantines to incoming flights from Wuhan. If they did, much spread would have been prevented.

In fairness, in mid January our countries were still mostly up our own asses at that point over how "racist" travel restrictions were, so it's not clear that China's being open would have been effective given that Western countries might have chosen to not apply blanket quarantines. I'm not suggesting that China's one decision made the whole difference. But it is definitely worthy of criticism.But I'm not suggesting they should have locked all the westerners in Hubei. I'm suggesting they could have started with their own citizens at least, which would have been both eminently reasonable and also an effective step to reduce transmission since many foreign hotspots (particularly northern Italy) were linked to travel by Chinese nationals from Hubei.

It is also worth noting that foreign nationals in Hubei were equally barred from internal travel in China, so this isn't some foreign vs. domestic citizenship issue. It was motivated simply by the fact that the infections that left the country were not China's problem.

You appear to be reading a lot of dumb shit into my comment that I did not write. Presumably you are doing this because of the things you have heard other people say, and extrapolating from this one comment of mine that I agree with them.

I will say this once, gently: engage with what I am actually writing, not with your spurious and inaccurate assumptions of my other views. You have no fucking idea what kind of person I am to make comments about "people like me" other than that I am criticizing one aspect of China's response. Many other aspects of China's response have been laudable. It has done one of the better jobs in the world of its response, frankly.

But I shouldn't have to write these disclaimers to prevent idiots from reading a bunch of bullshit into my statements.

This, of all forums, should ideally be free of people making shitty baseless assumptions. Conduct yourself accordingly, please.I'm talking about right now not absolving anyone of the past.  China extended their tyranny over Hong Kong in violation of treaty and now forcibly [sterilizing their Uyghur population.](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/chinas-ambassador-shown-shocking-video-22379489)

To whatabout the genocide of these people is beyond the pale. The US needs to be at the head of stopping this pure revival of Nazi crimes.  If we mean "Never Again" then here is the opportunity right now."Talented engineers are not going to stay away from attractive jobs in America in 2050 because of trump"

It has nothing to do with Trump and everything to do with economics. The US is simply no longer economically attractive for many educated people. The ridiculous cost of education and healthcare simply makes working and living in the US not that attractive. This isn't something that is caused by Trump, and it won't be something that can be fixed by whoever comes after Trump. 

Frankly the standard of living for middle class people suck in the US. Just look at how many people are in deep financial distress because they lost their job for a few months. Look at how many people are stuck in deep student loan debt because of the ridiculous cost of higher education.How then can you explain the inverse correlation between recessions and fertility if greater wealth leads to lower fertility?So don’t fixate on issues that will spark WW3? Okay makes sense. You do you.They do not have an substantial enduring effect, being cyclical, on per-capita GDP. Likewise but more importantly they do no reverse the course of declining fertility in the developed countries suffering these recessions - a recession does not turn NYC into rural South Sudan, the social and economic context does not change radically. Explanatory power goes to the social sciences, perhaps the usual stress-induced sexual activity hearkening back to the human impulse to have more children during bad times, like famines, human emotions and anxiety within individuals don't differentiate the severity in absolute terms across history. Good times, and wealth, give people the luxury of thinking ahead to delay and plan child bearing. The result is fewer children, another proxy of this is female education attainment. Poverty breeds children, even if many more die than they otherwise would with more wealth available to the families having them.No dumbass, don't fixate on a proposal I didn't make. I wasn't talking about fucking foreign expats, I was talking about Chinese citizen nationals. Which I literally just explained in the last fucking comment, so at this point it is pretty clear that your being an imbecile is intentional.I have a different perspective on this. I think wealth should not be a 1-dimensional concept. The traditional concept of wealth is $/capita income or assets, but this only captures a subset of wealth. The optionality of free time, the relative cost of goods and services, and opportunity cost of children all matter.

Most middle class people in "wealthier" countries are mostly wealthier in a very narrow sense. They have greater access to industrialized products and services. Yet many goods and services such as housing, education, childcare are extremely expensive as a percentage of their income. In many developed countries, the cost of daycare for 2 children will equal the median income for women. The cost of housing requires 2 incomes to finance a family home. This is a sign of poverty rather than wealth.

Many middle class in developed countries are extremely time poor, and raising children is a time intensive activity. They are wealthy enough to afford material goods, but they are not wealthy enough to pay the time opportunity costs of raising children.

Fertility rates will bounce back when average people have lots of free time and energy to do whatever they want. It is being able to afford a house without both parents having to work. I think a generous UBI program will help recover fertility rates across the developed world.Ah personal insults now eh? Do you need some help getting your points across? Or just continue insulting people on the internet, please don’t let me stop you.I need no help getting my points across, but when I encounter idiots who do not read them I stop bothering to communicate respectfully and just insult you.The insults don’t really help to make your point even if it sometimes make a difference in the court of public opinion. Either way, insults only serve to discredit your arguments, as does justifying your insults.If the reason your tenant is going out of business is because they owe you money, you can buy them for very cheap in bankruptcy and forgive their debts. You could end up with some decent assets. 

You also save yourself from actually having to recognize those losses in your financial statements.Surprised no one has mentioned co-tenancy issues here yet. To me thats the big reason why you as the Landlord would rescue an anchor like JC Penny. I'd bet a huge chunk of the smaller yet sophisticated tenants in the malls have clauses in their lease where if JC Penny or any anchor goes down, a portion of their rent is abated.

Some off the cuff guesses:

1) It looks like the acquisitions are often for anchor tenants. Anchor tenants pay the least per square foot but drive your pricing power on other tenants, especially on a longer lived lease. So it’s normal for a strip mall for example to have something like 70% of revenue driven by only 30-40% of space. I remember in one extreme case the last 20% of space was probably worth 45% of revenue. By owning the anchor tenant, you are increasing the potential “yield” you collect on the property
2) given the environment , if Retail owners have a speculative eye to be opportunistic, there’s a strong argument that they have the best information advantage. They have foot traffic statistics, business understanding, site placement 
3) capital flow prioritization. A retailer can buy the business and prioritize its capital flows to rent payments. As an independent entity it may elect to attempt a lease break or rent non payment.Dude, this link sucks.Haven’t read about this but one reason could be to repurpose their properties (I.e. convert big box retail stores to warehouses/other industrial facilities). Could be pretty lucrative if you buy cheap enough.

Can you provide some example acquisitions?Probably for the real estate.Experience Showrooms for fashion, electronics, toys, ect. No in-store purchases, except by delivery

Shipping/Recieving for pick-ups & returns (cheaper than paying FedEx & UPS)

Carry-Out Only for consumers and food delivery companies from major food chains like Chipotle & Panera Bread.

Office Space (this was actually happening before the pandemic, not sure how solid that plan in now since most office workers are at home now)Probably because they don't have a competent biostatistician on the payroll. This question is sort-of akin to why did people buy Hertz after it declared bankruptcy. People make poor decisions all the time.  Same, with a decade ago when companies started buying distressed malls. History of full of people making bad decisions.Number 1 is false, these arent anchor tenants. Idc what an article says, nobody would classify forever 21 or brooks brothers as an anchor tenant.

Number 3 is the answer. The RE firms are just trying to shore up the balance sheets of the clients that take up a lot of real estate space, and that money is going to flow back to them anyway. They aren't buying all the bankrupt retailers, just the best ones for them. No REIT is gonna buy J Crew. They're going to attempt to turn around these stores by actually downsizing themNo he means Simon buys forever 21 for example. They don't have independent locationsNone of the companies being bought have real estate assets!!

Can people stop replying if they don't know the answer wtfOh my. This seems like a terrible idea.[removed]Dude how many REITs are acquiring retailers? Literally only two: Simon and Brookfield

Yes OP could have been more specific but if you didn't know what he's talking about, then you don't follow the sector close enough to have an answer anywayFor those in the know...

1) What do you think about this? Is there something this piece misses, what will competitors do?

2) The article claims Jio's network is IP based and therefore has lower capital requirements than network that need to deliver older, voice, capabilities. Could a future shift cause this (displacement of incumbents with cheaper technology) to occur yet again? Maybe Elon Musk's Starlink service? 

3) Could someone do the same in the U.S.? Is it a lack of spectrum that limits activity here? If so, maybe what Ambani could get preferential access to is spectrum, and beat out other carriers that might be able to otherwise offer the same thing?

4) What are the negative perspectives on this? It seems very positive so I just want to understand some of the risks present.When future networking tech is talked about, I am not sure why Starlink is mentioned enough. Starlink by SpaceX is probably gonna revolutionize internet tech.

Either this or I don't understand Starlink correctly.I think the narrative in the article conceals quite a bit of information. Ambani achieved what he achieved, most likely, through corruption. All of the stuff he did wasn't possible for other providers (for example, carrying voice over data) because Ambani paid people off.

What Ambani did also wasn't some tech masterstroke, it was a function of the high levels of regulation in India (and his unique ability to ignore those regulations). All of the voice over data stuff occurs everywhere, in most countries (afaik) the issue is regulatory because there tends to have been a monopoly provider who owns exchanges/copper so voice over data is less about cheaper hardware but less friction (in most cases, your traffic is still going through those copper wires to an exchange...you just don't need to pay all the ludicrous "line rental" charges). The big issue in many countries is access. These services are mainly marketed to business but there is a concern about whether all retail customers will be able to use this service (where I am, the monopoly infrastructure provider is moving 100% to voice over data).

(Also, the article says that the govt generated revenue from this...no, they lost revenue because of the way providers pay the govt in India).

The other big "innovation" (again, not really) in this space is internet over mobile. So having your home broadband supplied by a mobile company (i.e. Sprint or whoever) which potentially works with 5G. The point is though that all the innovation is really in the point of contact with the customers and around the copper wires/exchanges/last mile part of the chain. All the backhaul stuff is basically unchanged. I have never found any of this to be that interesting tbh. It is a race to the bottom, and these companies are really just innovating in marketing...that is it (and backhaul fibre generally hasn't been a good investment, towers have because the economics are different).

Also, the point of the article really isn't about Jio but the splintering of the internet. This is definitely happening but it isn't really black and white. EU data protection rules really aren't some onerous threat to innovation...like it is your data, and you should be allowed to choose whether another company sells that data. A lot of this stuff is pretty much straight from Google's public policy division (if they are unable to target ads, their prices go down 10-20%...Google have been lobbying very aggressively on this but that surplus price is because they sell/collect your property).1. The main thing about Jio is this: Over the past few years, they have worked ground-up to become a monopoly. Their customer base is extremely large compared to any other competitor. Think about it- free internet for 3 months to millions of people. I saw it happen. They were very successful in acquiring a loyal base. 

2. Even if Starlink might cause disruption, it will be years from now and Jio will 100% find a way to partner as Reliance is always one step ahead of the game. So, I’m not worried about that at all. They have the cash and capacity to overpay just to cut out competition. 

3. America has a lot more competition in this space compared to India. Don’t know very well about the technicals but my guess is that it can be done. For eg: Facetime audio

4. The only negative aspect I see is it being priced in. Reliance stock is trading high rn but my guess is that it’s a good long term play. No regulatory burdens imo as Reliance is known to have a good affiliation with the current government and the current government will retain power in 2024 elections.>What do you think about this? Is there something this piece misses, what will competitors do?

I can try to answer this. I am not sure how people are claiming that Jio is a monopoly already, yes they are the market leader, early mover into internet apps ecosystem. But their market share is around 33% and the next competitors' Airtel is at 29% and Vodafone at 29%. 

Now I'm not quite aware of Vodafone but I think Airtel is not something you can dismiss so easily. Airtel's biggest strengths are:

1. Significant % of urban Indian elite are with Airtel and though that number is shrinking, it has not alarming.
2. Again in the B2B context, Airtel has a much better market share than Airtel and from what I know they are focusing on building a better B2B internet app ecosystem, unlike Jio which has a stronger B2C app ecosystem. While Airtel does have a good consumer app ecosystem, it is not easily understood as Hike, Wynk stand as independent units and not do brandish Airtel brand.
3. Airtel has better partnerships with global telcos unlike Jio with their top brass having done significant stints at British, Australian, and Singapore telcos.
4. Airtel is a market leader in many African countries too where they seem to be attempting the Jio model.

Beyond this, Airtel makes a great partner for Amazon to counter JioRetail and Airtel's B2B ecosystem to complement the AWS suite. Previously the Softbank group had invested in Airtel Africa and there were rumors of an investment in Airtel India too. It does not seem coincidental that Airtel's 5G partner Ericcson is the same as Softbank's 5G cloud vendor. 

I am not an expert, just someone who has made some observations.  
TL;DR Jio is not a monopoly yet and might see some significant competition but so far, Jio seems to be much more ambitious and well equipped.My understanding is it will be better for backhaul as opposed to direct user access, but maybe that will differ by region. In remote areas (rural, developing countries, etc.), it could be direct access.Satellite internet will never be competitive with fiber for urban or even surburban areas. The trade offs between latency and bandwidth are simply intractable.The EU data protections also are applied equally for any company with an EU citizen customer, US companies also have to foot the bill for the privacy protections.

In that respect I see a convergence of EU and US internet regulations over the long-term. The EU may claim it has concerns about technical surveillance by the US, though I think that is out of a misunderstanding by the EU High Court about how [EU governments similarly spy](https://www.lawfareblog.com/full-glare-european-hypocrisy-surveillance) upon their citizens. In that respect, I suspect recent rulings are more an attempt to get around the law to disrupt US corporate hegemons rather than to "advance" EU citizens rights.

The article also ignores an up and coming sector- Africa. The mobile approach in India (or Starlink) should similarly help connect the masses to the internet, and provide the economic benefits thereof. It would be a much more uneven application of laws, maybe a mix of the Chinese and US-EU construct amongst the dictatorships and emerging nations.>The main thing about Jio is this: Over the past few years, they have worked ground-up to become a monopoly.

— I will say without trying to glamorize it too much — 
An increase of ease and access to equities can be good in current economic conditions (including over phone for people who may not even have a desktop)
— where there is a clear priority to save the shareholders with economic policy and interest rates zero not much to be gained from other financial instruments —- maybe this will help lessen the wealth gap for younger generation if they all grow up trading and following markets. 

Of course options are another part of the storyfinally, someone said it out loud lolI can't wait to read the Michael Lewis book in a few years about the current stock market bubble!Really interesting. As someone who went down the "I don't understand options, but people are making a lot of money" rat hole, I'm glad to see I'm in good company.

Yes we're both still monumental idiots for trading in something we don't understand - but at least we learned from our mistakes.Thank you for posting. 

RobinHood is complete garbage fire in all cases. There is literally no reason to use it unless a real broker won’t open an account with you.I wrote this in another thread:

>On a side note, Robinhood is one of the sadder things that I've seen in investing. The business plan appears to be : "An untapped source of PFOF is the negligible asset investor segment. We will combine a low barrier to entry (paid for with lousy execution / operations / service, and VC money), gameification dopamine kicks, and dubious services to aggregate and convert inexperienced serfs into gambling addicts / attention whores to suck out what little savings that they have so that we can hyperscale and sell the company before FINRA or the SEC shuts us down." It wouldn't surprise me to find out that Robinhood ~~is~~ partly resembles an AUM ponzi scheme where they have to attract new investors at a fast rate to make up for the drop in assets of their customer base.Great article. Trading and gambling is not investing. How many different ways can this be made clear.

I was wrong about Robin Hood when this all started. I thought it would facilitate a way for people to get out of the market faster than ever, faster than any crash since 1929. This is what I expected. Dead wrong. People rushed in. The app jammed up and crashed again and again and people were prevented from leaving the market on big days. The digital stampede has severe lag. Easy to get in, hard to get out. I'm not on Robinhood, but I do watch wallstreetbets like the new Jackass. It's not as amusing now as it was a few months ago. There are too many of them. Just like Jackass, friends started jumping off roofs and it got exhausting. Maybe it's the age. Teens and 20 somethings are more prone to the traps of yolo, fomo, gambling, animal spirits, myopia, debt, everything shitty. Robinhood is a wasp trap. The sugar water is inside, the bottleneck will kill you.Hard to argue access to equities trading will lessen the wealth gap when these kids are learning all the wrong lessons and becoming traumatized such that they never learn how to invest in a prudent manner. For a majority of them the market is just a casino where you go double or nothing based on a hunch. Options are just a tool, there are plenty of practical, reasonable ways to deploy options as part of a larger strategy... these people just don’t know how to do that because they sign disclosures without actually reading or understanding.Most people get subpar returns when it comes to investing. 

Wealthy people are smart enough to index and use asset allocation, stuff that works well with large sums of money. 

If the average person tried that then they would still never catch up because the returns are proportionate to your dollar investment.

This means for people to lower the wealth gap through investing then people with less money have to take on more risk per dollar invested to get higher returns than the wealthy.

But again, as we know most people aren't exactly the best at managing risk or know their tolerance to it, react too quickly and too drastically to headlines, and overall react on a shorter timeline than necessary for things like single equity investments to work out; holding for a few weeks/months when they should be holding for a year at least.

This leads to the lower performance and doesn't really allow for wealth inequality, on a large scale, to be solved.The wealth gap is important but what’s most important is the access to wealth. When I started it was $7 trades and a $500 min to start. And at the time that was a low barrier of entry. But it still made it difficult for people of lower income to invest in stocks because the fees will destroy their low value trades. It did benefit me though because I learned to hold stocks longer and it helped me narrow my picks instead of buying a bit of everything I liked Willy nilly. Today with no fees it really does level the playing field for low income investors. Will most of them suck? Probably. But that’s because a lack of education, lack of guidance from other wealthy people and sometimes just a lack of intelligence not because a lack of opportunity. The chance to do it is more important than the outcome. For now. There will inevitably be bright kids who build wealth and move out of poverty or low income family cycles because of a low barrier of entry into the stock market now days.If education and guidance were determinants of trading success, Goldman Sachs would have done better over the last decade.Ultimately these DIPs are a continuation of the trend of DIP lenders vying for equity control, just the way that is approached is different on the term sheet.Most DIP loans are from vulture funds... Having to strategize an investment of a loan to own of distressed bankrupt companies.LATAM shareholders trying to keep control of the company in this manner appears like a pretty egregious violation of absolute priorityI agree, both the bondholder & knighthead objections make a very good argument supporting your point and I suspect the financing wont work. 

From a high level, the LATAM DIP fits in with DIPs that seek equity control via aggressive milestone terms, collateral, or preferential access to rights offerings, etc. A topic I've been personally interested in over the last several months.Valuations are likely too high but article ignores IBM completely botching the PC revolution and simultaneously paying Microsoft for DOS and letting them sell it to others. They literally financed their own down fall.i sort of disagree. the difference now is that the 10 year yield is at 0.6%

at that rate, paying 80x earnings for a company like Netflix is not too bad.> *Big-Cap Tech Stocks Are a Sucker Bet*

So suckers bet?Why is the word "still" in this title? 

They were a suckers be then. Maybe they are now. But in between they were a great place to go for large parts of that period.Tech is a lot different today than the 2000 bubble.  Back in 2000 projections were based on achieving a brand new scale because the internet was here to change the world.  Now the major companies have been determined and support themselves through services, hardware, straight out buying up competition, investing in startups, etc.  The P/Es are still high because that's the nature of tech. We won't know the inventions of the future but I wouldn't bet against an Amazon Apple or Google from having a hand in it.  If you think back to the amount of money these companies have already made their stock holders, it would have been a suckers bet not to hold them.It’s behind a pay wall. 

Anyway. Profits talk for themselves. All the big tech are making incrementally more money year on year. What’s wrong with valuations like this? In a few years you will turn back and say wow it was so cheap then.Valuations are high but seriously, people have just talked themselves into a narrative that all SAAS valuations are just completely untethered from reality. They are fairly valued to a fair bit overvalued. It really depends on the company you're talking about.

People keep talking about shitter companies, but what about the good ones? Atlassian, Twilio, Veeva, etc are all growing 30%+ with 30%+ FCF margins, with contractual stability. Those numbers deserve stratospheric valuations. That kind of shit literally wasn't possible until like 10 years ago. And if you analyze the business, you can see these companies have vice grips on their respective industries.

Some companies are overvalued - people think some companies are going to be Atlassian when they're not going to be. That happens. But in a world where rates are tiny, valuations will be exponentially higher. It's incumbent on PMs or whoever to manage that risk.I don’t disagree, but... Apparently not.I like this quote from the Q2 letter for Vltava Fund.

"Imagine that you went shopping in your supermarket and you were greeted by a large sign “Prices don´t matter.” Would that seem normal to you? I think that prices (and fundamentals) always matter."Disagree.    But one thing that is missed on many is how fast some of the big tech companies are still growing even though they now have over a trillion dollar market cap.

Take Google.   Last three years had 18%, 23% and 23% top line growth.  Amazon had even stronger growth but, yes, it is pretty pricey right now.   The other two, Microsoft and Apple also have nice growth and just not nearly as strong as Google and Amazon.

Out of the four companies and over the last three years they only had one decline.   Apple in 2019.

But they have also barely got started.   More industries will be taken over by big tech.  Look at things 20 years ago.  Big tech had nothing to do with advertising and now today the industry is owned by Google and Facebook.

You will see these big four eat up more and more industries.   A big one will be transportation.    There is only one company capable of

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6lIhMRe6wQ

But it is not a car company today.  Then there is shipping/logistics that will also go full automation at some point. 

Then there is the fact that AI/ML will more and more be critical to more and more industries.What is it with IBM honestly, pretty much for the last 30 years people have been talking about this particular company completely bottling it.


Heck, there's an email exchange in the 90s between Buffet and a Microsoft exec (forgot his name, he later became president of the gates foundation for a while) where they mention IBM missing out on the the tech trend at the moment.


It's like any example of large cap incompetence can be attributed to IBM

I guess credit to them for not having much outright fraudGreat example of why the stock market is disconnected with the economy and expected growth. So much liquidity supplied to banks and their customers, they need a place to park their cash. They put it where they feel is the safest bet with the highest yield which is big tech. The game can keep on going though as long as we don’t hit stagflation and rates remain low.Agreed that near-zero yields lead to somewhat unique circumstances. I'm personally bullish on equities. Still, it did feel somewhat alarming to be reminded that quite a few of the names he mentions there substantially grew their business over the next decade (CSCO, QCOM) without creating much shareholder value. You could easily substitute some of those names with TSLA, etc.Meanwhile, value stocks with their 10x P/E...I think an extra 0.6% return for an equity over 10YT is not enough of a safety margin given the risks. 40X is reasonable but I would still be keeping a close eye for corrections.Their "earnings" however are hardly that.  Their earnings (except for the last two quarters) are from borrowing."History has shown that whenever companies, no matter how great, get priced above 50 to 60 times earnings, buyer beware."

&#x200B;

> But many of today's investors are unfazed by history -- and by the failure of any large-cap stock ever to justify, by its subsequent record, a P/E ratio anywhere near 100. As the chart nearby shows, of the 33 stocks (18 tech and 15 nontech) that have a capitalization over $85 billion today, an incredible nine currently have P/E ratios in excess of 100, and six of those are in the top 20. 

I don't think QQQ or SPY properly refute his argument, since A) ETFs are regularly rebalanced which removes losers and rewards winners; and B)the ETFs include a broad array of firms that fall outside the scope of his argument.

I'm not convinced the article is alarmingly appropriate today - I'd need clarification on that.Yes, because you are comparing it at a very high level. You would look very smart in 2000 as well if you only considered the top.When are they not a great place to go? Seemingly no one can say.Agree with this - 2000 was about what it might be, 2020 is what it is going to be... but that doesn’t take away from all the froth is some tech valuations. I suspect there will be a good amount of consolidation in the next decade and a few shareholders left holding the dud.It's a bit hard to put a price on things that are 99% terminal value though isn't it?

While it's true price matters, price matters 'more' for value stocks and 'less' for growth stocks due to the inherent uncertainty of the value of the growth. Using P/E, P/B, P/S multiples is kind of useless isn't it?

I think it's kind of funny seeing all of these 'value' investors clamoring that they don't understand how tech stocks aren't collapsing when they're seeing huge decreases in ad spends for these companies (20%+), when a single or even three year decrease is nearly irrelevant to the value of these companies.Since the '70s traders have said the following of IBM:

Then you can read Barbarians Led by Bill GatesThe web is essentially dumb terminals to a main frame, same as the PC's before that.  IBM dominated the mainframe market, and still does.  As such the face a very real problem of cannibalizing their own market.  See Eastman-Kodak with digital cameras, Xerox with the GUI, and likely Ford/GM with the electric car.I feel like it's important to point out that it's possible for money to flow into equities while valuations for expensive firms fall.To that end, I think there's a missed opportunity when discussing the possibility of a cold war with China (for example) or really any large-scale reemergence of nationalist ideologies that stifle growth for these massive tech companies. How much of the inflated value of, say, Netflix, is based on their ability to grow indefinitely into a market like China?I can see your point on tesla. I think the enthusiasm there is that they have basically cut the cost of an electric car in half in the last 5 years. 

With autonomous and future reductions in battery costs, they could be one of the largest companies in the world with great margins. 

I do agree though that there could be a lot of competition and that this could be an amazon in 1999 type situation. (I am not long tesla)Can you name a good value stock with a 10 PE ? At least half my portfolio is at less than a 10 PE if you look 3-5 years out, but most "value" stocks have no earnngs visibiltythe thing about netflix is that in many of their markets, they are only 20-30% market share. Their margins are also extremely low in those countries. they will be at 30-40x in a few years and likely at 20x in the future with growth and margin expansion.

in contrast, a company like altria could have fast lower earnings 5-10 years from nowI don't think you understand how their accounting works for content acquisition. 

I don't think that paying for original content is a cash expense that should be incurred when the cash leaves. I also think funding it with debt is a smart way to fund content investment.

If you have an argument for why their accounting elections are fraudulent, please enlighten me. For now, it is crystal clear that their investment approach has been exceptional over the past 20 years.

If tech stocks were to be 1,000x the current price, it still applies. A lot of people think using that reasoning, but at root it becomes a justification for what is fundamentally gambling. Or do you disagree? Is there a maximum price that you would pay to buy these tech stocks and how do you determine what that is? Actually, if you can answer that question, you are halfway to answering the broad question of how to value tech companies (the other half is to determine the minimum price that you would sell at). But if you can't answer that question, then on what basis are you investing that isn't "bigger fool theory"?Googling the origins of this term it seems to originate from selling strangles, which really isn't relevant at all - this simply implies that people were mis-estimating volatility.

They legitimately are worried about what’s happening in the economy. They feel safer placing their money in big tech despite valuations because those are the companies they expect to make it out of the pandemic with the least damage or profiting from the change in consumer behavior. I personally think the liquidity will make its way to other areas of the market, but money will keep flowing into tech If people are fearful. Unless we hit an unexpected bump in the road that brings into question the governments ability to backstop the financial economy, I don’t see high valuations coming down anytime soon.I hold Altria which has a P/E of 9 or so.It's a joke. Because tech stock investors have all kinds of justifications for their rich valuations, but the same reasons that should apply to the entire stock market somehow don't apply to out-of-favor value stocks. The 10-year yield argument applies to all stocks. Investors use those justifications (in favor of tech/growth or against value) to rationalize their investing decisions.Wells Fargo?I’m not much of an earnings man but I’d say VW, BMW? Dell is a special situation play at 10 p/e. Discover have relatively decent visibility in the future.NFLX is a stock I will not understand. The only thing it differentiates on is original content and maybe its platform. I don't think it's overly special as a platform and believe competitors will catch up. Its original content is decent, but why does that put a huge multiple on it? It's just a media company at that point. 

It's highly competitive, and any non-original content will just be bid up to a slim profit margin when renewals are put in place.I didn’t say they had any fraud in their accounting.  I’m merely pointing out that they have negative free cash flow.

It is not because it's not at all what he's arguing. He isn't saying the broad market index is overvalued, he is specifically talking about individual firms. 

> (amazon had a pe of over 500 on many instances since 2006, would this have been a horrible buy?).

This is an example of hindsight bias. Retrospectively, obviously Amazon looks like it would have been a good buy, but the question is whether it was a good buy given the information available at the time. If you werent anticipating AMZN transforming into the largest cloud platform provider in the world, it might not have - or, you would have been incredibly lucky.**I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**

I think you have to determine what you think a future state of the company could look like and discount it back today and calculate the various IRRs at different price levels. You can probably also throw some additional upside in for things you haven't even considered in the tech world if you're very confident in mgmt/the product (AWS for example in the case of Amazon).

It's ultimately some question of TAM/years to get there/mkt share.

People were predicting them to collapse and disintegrate like Data General, Honeywell, CDC, or Wang. The surprising thing was when they held the ship. But they were never the 1970s IBM, that's not coming back.

You can compare the two perspectives. Look at the 1981 text by Sobel, IBM, a Colossus in Transition and compare it to the fumblings with the pen computing craze as documented in Jerry Kaplan's Startup from 1994.

They sold off their Aptiva and Lenovo lines and the 90s had a bunch of failed products like the IBM Simon.  They never got their stuff together, but somehow never lost the farm. Their latest debacle, the Power Series CPU, which is actually 35 years old, on a price/performance ratio, is behind AMD, Arm, and Intel. It sits around Oracle's Sparc.

They have a few super-computer contracts with it but I've only met 1 serious person about a Power series workstation, at a linux conference, probably about 6 years ago ... that's it ... other offerings like Z/OS, MVS, and AIX ... these are like seeing endangered species. Super rare.Neither do I. I'm also very bullish on "the cloud," as I think we've only barely scratched the surface of what's possible when it comes to data.I'm just saying, the reason why the PE is low is that investors seem to expect earnings declinesI don't think it completely applies. Because companies like Square have long and potentially multi-decade runways, lower interest rates have a big effect on value.

In contrast, a lower quality and potentially declining business such as Wells Fargo has been hurt by the pandemic.If you look at Wells Fargo, their efficiency ratio is rising. This suggests that customers are leaving, and that online banking is posing more of a threat.

If you look at companies like Bank of America, the PE doesn't look to good in light of the squeeze on Net interest margin that is coming.I think VW and BMW might be beaten down. For now, the market seems to be pricing in either autonomous or massive growth in market share for tesla.

I really don't have a clear picture on where the electrification roadmap will be 10 years from now.

Dell is interesting because of the VMWare spinoff, I don't know about the hardware business, but it could be a decent cigar butt if the enterprise value is low enough.in my opinion their moat comes from the fact that they have the largest subscriber base. this allows them to outbid others on exclusive content. it also gives them more firepower to spread original content investment over a large subscriber base.

their scale and their years of operational data also give them an advantage in bidding for content rights. in my opinion their engineering team and culture around that will not be replicated by the competition.Netflix does not have negative free cash flow, at least over the TSM. Regardless, the reason FCF is so low is because NFLX consistently invests >~3x earnings into content asset additions, which are revenue generating assets. If NFLX were to reduce their spending to pay out dividends it would be at the expense of growth. 

Alternatively, why would we want their free cash flow to be high? FCF should either be paid out as dividends or reinvested into the firm. They're literally reinvesting what would be FCF, it's just being reconciled in OCF.they depreciate the catalog over 4 years. I don't have any reason to believe the content isn't valuable over 4 years. 

their data science team can also determine exactly what the useful life of content is. it is not too difficult to have a reasonable estimate of the present value of content if one knows how many hours are watched and how that engagement translates to retention. 

to suggest that netflix does not depreciate their content accurately is to accuse them of fraud. i don't think their management is committing fraud.\>  This is an example of hindsight bias. Retrospectively, obviously Amazon looks like it would have been a good buy, but the question is whether it was a good buy given the information available at the time. If you werent anticipating AMZN transforming into the largest cloud platform provider in the world, it might not have - or, you would have been incredibly lucky.   


That was the point I was making. PE in this situation tells you nothing of the under lying business. More so in the case of tech where business are able to mess with the E like AMZN was able to.  Hence why I explicitly asked why you think PE is a good metric for this.There’s a lot of stuff here.  

Let’s just start with the CPU “debacle”.  Are you referring to the POWER9?  What benchmarks are you referencing for price/performance?What are your top cloud possibilities?Banks are literally hurt by lower interest rates, so that is a poor example, not to mention that being lower quality or declining is not what is at question.. You say "multi-decade runways" basically referring a NPV or DCF idea and I agree on growth stocks being affected more in this simple model. But value stocks should benefit from lower rates in the same model.I guess we'll see. I think Wells Fargo's deposits have risen each year for like 100 years, with a few exceptions. Maybe this will be the turning of the tide.They do for now, but I think the inherent problem with things like Netflix is how low the switching costs are. There's no contracts like cable TV (though, this can admittedly be switched), and it's hard not to imagine someone makes something that allows you to share/switch memberships easier so you can easily access more content. Maybe everyone ends up owning subscriptions to several streaming services due to laziness, but the only way that happens is if they remain 'cost effective' which takes away the upside from raising prices. 

I think operational data is overstated. It seems pretty common when you talk to VCs/people in the industry that the value of data isn't as great as you'd hope. The first 10% gives you enough to understand the customer.

Maybe engineering and culture won't be replicated, but I'm not sure that can offset what seems like an ok/decent business vs an amazing business. I'm not saying Netflix won't exist in 10 years - I just don't see why it earns the multiple it does vs. something like Disney.Quick question:  How do you think Netflix is currently valuing its non-current content assets?No, now you're changing your argument. You originally stated that his argument could be refuted because index ETFs returned a positive CAGR over the past 20 years. I responded by pointing out that that's a false comparison because it completely misses the point the author was originally trying to make.Any. (Not done by IBM)

Look at The IBM Way by Rodgers, who described iIBM as a  marketing, not a technology firm.

Any analysis would do.I'll sound pretty mainstream, but mainly edge providers and platforms. I think most of the growth will be on the IaaS/PaaS side of things. My portfolio is posted on my profile if you're curious what I hold.not if their earnings are front loaded and declining.Do a simple 10 year before terminal growth valuation and you'll see how sensitive growth stocks are to lower interest rates. If memory serves me correctly, assume terminal growth of 4%, a drop of WACC from 9% to 8% increases npv of a company growing at 20% pa by 30%. By contrast, that effect on a company that has 5% pa growth is just 10 - 15%.The second argument was in support of the first. Namely, etfs are okay to be used because it smooths out issues with selection effects and just pure randomness of companies being good or bad. No one expected IBM, or Intel to be as inept as they ended up being. 

I also pointed out that there might be a Gettier problem occurring cause PE is a really bad metric to use. As I said in the first post no one is going to disagree that you should be wary in the price you pay.It's still yes because lower rate means higher NPV. And since when did value mean declining or distressed business? But of course, you are right if you never say yes.>and I agree on growth stocks being affected moreThe fact that ETFs smooth out selection effects and the randomness of companies being "good" or "bad" is exactly why they aren't a good comparison metric. If you had an ETF of, say, **only** companies that were trading above a 100x PE multiple and didn't re-balance when companies were de-listed or acquired (SM by ORCL for ex.), then I think you'd have a good comparison. 

By using SPY or QQQ, you're including companies with price-earning multiples below the threshold set by the author, which is why I said it isn't comparable - because he is very specifically **not** talking about these firms. 

Whether P/E is a good measurement to use when valuing a firm is irrelevant, since in this case we're only concerned with P/E. 

Also, the fact that IBM & and INTC performed as poorly as they did directly supports the author's argument - namely, that the companies were unable to generate sufficient returns (growth) to meet the expectations of investors.

The companies were as expensive as they were because investors were front-loading expected future growth by bidding up the price. Unfortunately, they weren't able to meet investors' expectations.This is a really good point, thanks for clarifying. Basically saying an index isn’t the same as a stock pick. It keeps the best, i.e misses out on the fallen angels eg Pets.com - or whatever one calls a hot growth stock that goes dud...woofI am not familiar with the author. But having an annualized growth since inception at about half the S&P doesn’t cause me to put aside other readings for this..This guy is a self obsessed, pretentious douche. I emailed him a a few years ago and you’d think I asked Warren Buffett for a lunch date based on his response.

Why does this guy write like a college sophomore?
>Like Garrett’s,
Kontoor’s CEO is dynamic and has repeatedly surprised me by acting intelligently. But Kontoor had a
number of advantages over Garrett: bankruptcy was far less likely, Kontoor had already gotten covenant
relief, Kontoor’s business does not face existential threats (everyday jeans are here to stay, with
turbochargers… time will tell), and one of Kontoor’s insiders had recently purchased shares.
Kontoor does not have quite as much upside if things go as I expect, but there are more ways to lose with
Garrett, and losing with Garrett is more likely to involve a wipeout for shareholders. Comparing the two,
Kontoor appeared to be a better bet than GarrettIt may be like Bill Ackman where you need to give him a few years before the thesis manifests.I see his twitter comments now and then and I could not agree more.  He's an idiot and a self-absorbed 'genius' at the same time.Interesting take. It may be true but I question the utility of vague, unsubstantiated criticism, especially delivered in such vitriolic fashion.I would focus more on the soundness of what he says than tiny quibbles with his writing style.

* MSFT - impressive growth with new CEO and who stops them? Leader in the enterprise area as a cloud-service provider, team communications provider, Office 365, data analysis and BI facilities. Missing AI component, but their business is well diversified and very steady. International exposure.
* AAPL - until revolution in smartphones (like NeuraLink or any other interface which will remove smartphones at all) very decent business. 5G is coming, a diversified business, large pile of the cash in the pocket. Apple Music is eating Spotify pie, new SE & iPhone 12 should be a best-seller during X-Mas time. International exposure.
* V - leader in the world of payments, slowly entering the crypto area, and its balance-sheet a bit better than Mastercard. In general both are good choices. The only issue is that for Visa default currency is USD, while for MA - EUR, and USD might be weakier soon.
* INTC - leader in the retail chipset area, right now controls almost the entire CPU area.
* NVDA - one of the few "growth" stocks here. Its P/E is very high, but low leverage, impressive P/S and amazing return on employed capital is making the day. NVDA is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI industry coming, as well as auto-pilot vehicles.
* CTXS - ok, there is another growth company. Citrix provides capabilities to work from home without buying dedicated hardware. It means you don't need to buy everyone a corporate laptop to enable them to safely join from home. It is held by top index funds, and attracts a lot of S&P 500 clients, who have high hopes in them.
* BABA - yes, not the AMZN. BABA right now is extremely undervalued. They look absolutely amazing in every financial aspect, and thanks to extreme digitalisation of Asia, their revenue is growing super fast.
* NKE - from one hand this is a consumer cyclical company, but from another - very strong brand. Their online shopping presens is huge, as well as exposure to a world market including China. I might assume they will stay around for a while thanks to the new trend of being healthy.
* ACN - top IT consulting company, basically working for every Fortune 500 company. Right now I see 3 factors they will keep growing. At first, companies needed expertise to migrate to new cloud infrastructure. At seconds, companies will reduce their hiring budget for a while, but will instead hire external resources more intensively. At third, ACN made few acquisitions in the cyber-security area.
* (Disclaimer: I had worked for EPAM for 5 years and might be biased)  EPAM - one of the faster growing IT services companies in the world. They have a very strong expertise in almost every area, like integration of complex IT solutions, cloud migrations, online shopping, etc. I see them a long term winner of the current setup. Also they start expansion to the Asia market.
* CIEN - another long-term winner of working from home setup providing hardware configurations for organizing IT servers, clusters, telecommunications, etc.
* LDOS - one more IT services company but working in the aerospace & defense area with governments. One of the key vendors in the area of COVID-19 tracking facilities and digitalisation of government infrastructure to control COVID-19. Currently holds a portfolio of almost $30 bln agreements.
* AVGO - another 5G chipset producer winner. Very solid diversified portfolio, good fundamentals.
* TSM - semiconductor manufacturer, one the largest in the world. Produces chipsets for NVDA, INTC, AVGO, AMD and others. In my opinion, if I bet on the chipset industry it would be weird to not bet on TSM who is located in COVID-19 free area now and also has clients not only from the USA.
* LRCX - yet another semiconductor company, but this time a leader in the area of automatisation of production lines. They produce solutions which help to automate facilities - the thing most factories will look into to reduce risk of COVID or any other pandemic.
* MRK - one of the biggest healthcare companies. While everyone is watching Moderna, MRK also participates in the race for COVID-19 vaccine and has a very decent fundamentals and portfolio of products.
* REGN - innovative bio healthcare company, their financial and earnings are skyrocketing with a huge potential to grow.
* ROG - Swiss based healthcare company, very strong portfolio and financials
* BAYN - I am not a super big fan of Bayer, but they are definitely undervalued now due to all PR recent PR issues. Expect to grow 50% in upcoming years, with strong fundamentals. 
* VIAC - one of the most undervalued TV companies right now. Very strong portfolio and strong fundamentals, clean balance sheet. Frankly I spent hours trying to find a reason for such a low price and didn't manage to find any except for "index fund problem".  
* CI - insurance industry under the huge hit due to increasing expenses (people suffer from COVID) and reduced payments (people loosing job and might start cutting their spendings), but Cigna looks like one of the best to survive the storm and has a bright future for a long term. Faitly under-valued strong balance-sheet company.
* SU - European large cap producer of energy, data and sustainability facilities. 
* BN - Another European large cap company: food producer. They position themselves as a healthy food producer, and COVID should not distract them as much as Americans food producers are. 
* HD - One of rare bets on American consumer spending. Leader in the area of organizing houses in sub-urban zones. With growth of WFH setup, more people expected to migrate to the country-side, so in the long term HD might benefit. Their balance sheet is also very solid.
* VMC - Basic materials bet. Among all other basic materials companies, VMC looks the best. Also, despite I have high doubts about 1 tln infrastructure package to pass the Congress, VMC would benefit from this idea.
* BRK-B - no introduction is needed. Buffet underperformed S&P for a long time, but his portfolio is decent, he sits on a large pile of the cash and proper timing of deploying this cash would result in a great return later on. Still pretty safe to add BRK into my portfolio, their long term run looks pretty good.

Also I am considering adding 4 strong dividend companies with still promising futures.  


* IBM - it might look like a dying mamont, but IBM for years is a leader of patents. They year by year increase their presence in cloud infrastructure, AI, robotics and other topics. With new CEO targets growth, IBM has a pretty decent future for the moment with a diversified portfolio of technologies & patents. High hopes on IBM AI technologies. As well, IBM pays very huge dividends, so why not hold them for some time?
* T - the same story but in another segment. Might benefit from 5G, has a diversified portfolio, enters the "stream wars" area and pays a huge dividend. As a diversification for stocks who pays small dividends but grow in market cap, good choice. 
* STX - Another high dividend representative from the hardware storage business. This area will stay around for a while, and STX is healthier than their competitors, look like a safe bet for a long term holding. 
* ABBV - And the last high-dividend company from the healthcare segment. There is a lot of analysis of ABBV around, so no reason to repeat it all.

And 1 ETF:  


* EXV6 - since I am EU resident, I need to invest into UCITS, and this is a basic materials ETF mainly RIO, BHP, GLEN, AAL. This segment supports all manufacturing around the world, why should they have gone?

That's basically it. I am still playing around numbers to calculate the potential risk of this portfolio and define the proper % allocation of stocks, but what's your thoughts on the companies from the list?my current portfolio is: 

100 shares of Apple

671 shares of MicrosoftKind of made my own "fund" of stocks I like the most instead of just buying a regular ETF.

Pretty new investor, just looking to see what you all think. Am I too diverse? Are there any stocks that I have that I should stray away from? Any thoughts would be great! Thanks! :)I’m worth exactly $54.489.710,00 at the moment of this post. I liquidated my hole portfolio in Jan 2020. Around $39,7 million at the time. Reinvest everything in March after I got information that the Federal Reserve will do a Repo. Now around 6,5 month later I made 37% gain. That’s an annualized gain of over 200%.

Any advice constructive criticisms, roasts, and inputs are appreciated! :D u/Reddit

Wonderful cash-train that makes both dollars and sense.All (similar weights) are for the long, bought them around last week of march and through out April; I've cashed in on some profits and now looking for suggestion on how to rebalance it and if I should and when...

First post. Be kind (smiley face thingy).

Over the last 4 months I've built up a portfolio for the next 10+ years. With the Buffett strategy of hold, hold hold, but with mainly growth stocks, not value. I've divided into Big (over 5% of my portfolio), Medium (2 -4%) and Small (1.5% or less).

I'd be grateful if you all can point out the bad choices.

Big: Amazon, Tesla, Disney, Square, Illumina, Roku, Nvidia.

Med: FB, Alphabet, Netflix, Chegg, LuLu, Shopify, Spotify, MercadoLibre, Crowdstrike, The Trade Desk, Tractor Supplies, Walmart, Clorox, Pinterest, Huya, Sea, PayPal, Visa, Twilio, Adobe, Fastly, Docusign, Teladoc, Salesforce, Qualcoom, Skyworks, Waste Man, Starbucks, Invitae, Nike.

Small: 2U, Veeva, Activision, Autodesk, Etsy, Nokia, Pinduoduo, Zoom, TSM, Peloton, Okta, Zscaler, CrispR T, Xlinx, Splunk, Snap, Stratsys, Adyen, Teradyne, Lending Tree, Zillow, Nio.

As I say, I'm investing for the long term. I'm not selling any for short term gain, or trading. Cheers.My portfolio: Looking for long term retirement \~20 years  

My thesis, tech is good for business, military is good for business, clean energy long term, investing in the foundation of the future, staying away from entertainment, consumer goods. Will invest remaining cash towards the end of this year after a good stock crash. Open to suggestions, but will mostly be expanding my positions from this point on. Looking at ARKK, TSLA, and BOTZ for my shopping list. 

**Military**: 12.2% (3.8% LMT, 7.2% BA, 1.2% BAE)

**Utility/Defensive**: 3.08% (1.7% AWK, 1.38 WMT)

**Industrial**: 3.47% (CAT 3.47%)

**Tech**: 24.7% (16.5% AMZN, 5.45% NVDA, 2.75% MSFT)

**Financial/Dividend**: 11.41% (BNS 2.62%, RY 8.79%)

**ETF Energy, Medical, and Growth stocks** 9.84% (ACES 3.31%, 3.49% IHI, VOOG 6.53%)

**Cash**: 30.5%

**Gambling**: NRGU, $500.00 bucks. :DRobinhoodBeginner here. I have some stocks, would appreciate feedback on how to diversify or what to look into.

I currently have:  
* MSFT:20%  
* AAPL:20%  
* AMZN:20%  
* FB:13%    
* GOOG:10%  
* SBUX:9%  
* WORK:8%  

I recently sold some other stocks and bought more MSFT and AAPL. I'm thinking about selling SBUX and doing the same.

Given that I just mostly have the big 5 tech companies, should I just sell everything and be 100% QQQ? 

How dumb would it be to just be 50% MSFT and 50% AAPL?

I'm targeting growth, but don't necessarily want to put it into risky small companies either.

I can't tell you why I have so much DOCU. It's been good to me so far, so I have no reason to sell it.

Although I just bought in DDOG, SQ, SE, NET so I'm hoping they'll provide similar returns as DOCU. Last two are my hail marys :D

Thoughts on this portfolio? Hoping it will get me slightly better returns than VTI/VOO was.

ETFs: 

* VTI 25% 

* VEA 9%

* VWO 6.5%

* BRKB 9.5%

* MSFT 9%

Cash 7%Hello, I have been investing for a while now but nearly all my money has been put into Mutual Funds and I am now looking to diversify into some individual stocks. I recently consolidated my entire portfolio into Fidelity with 4 separate accounts

1. Company 401K
2. Personal Roth IRA
3. Personal Brokerage
4. Joint Brokerage with wife

My strategy going forward will be to leave the 401K and Roth untouched with their current mutual fund distribution. I intend on using my Personal Brokerage account to take a more aggressive approach.

My current distribution  can be found below and as you can see still includes some of the Mutual Funds I have been investing in.

* Ticker - # of shares - cost basis per share - % of total account
* SPG - 93 - $60.86 - 37%
* JAGTX - 98 -$34.17 - 23%
* FXAIX - 31 - $98.88 - 19%
* JRSTX - 254 - $10.42 - 16%
* JACTX - 15 - $32.60 - 3%
* JAGLX - 6 - $48.03 - 2%

My first and only purchase so far has been acquiring SPG. Other stocks I have been watching are GM, DIS, AAPL, ROKU, NKE, BTI. 

My question is does it make sense to completely liquidate the Mutual Fund positions above if I am holding similar positions in my Personal Roth - and if I do that, what stocks above make sense, or if there are suggestions for other stocks to consider?NKE (Nike) - 23%

My best performing stock. Bought at $70 and am up 44%. Nike will benefit from increased online sales. Their website and app allow them to sell directly to consumers. Nike is one of the best brands in the world. People are willing to pay a premium for their products. 

BABA (Alibaba) - 20%

Just bought this yesterday. This company is a massive growth and profit engine. Sales grew 46% per year on average over 5 years. EPS grew average 42% past 5 years. Profit margin 29%. I used to drop ship from Alibaba to Amazon and was amazed by this company. It's basically the world supplier. 

ULTA (Ulta Beauty) - 18% 

Ulta is one of the few retailers that Amazon won't destroy. Women like to try on makeup before they buy it. Ulta is a first stop for women when buying every day makeup. Their revenue and EPS growth have been steady and solid. 

DIS (Disney) - 18%

Disney+ has been a huge success and could catch up with Netflix. Disney owns so much great content and they're making it exclusive on Disney+.

ATVI (Activision) - 15%

COD Warzone has been a great hit. Several coworkers have been talking about it. I think investors are over estimating how much Q1 earnings were positively impacted by coronavirus. I think future earnings will be higher than expected because of Warzone. 

INTL (Intel) - 4% 

Intel may have a bad reputation with PC chips, but half their revenue comes from data centers. Their data center group grew 43% YOY. Cloud computing is the future. It gives any crappy computer access to super computer processing. Data centers are a highly profitable business. Intel has a 30% profit margin. With a p/e of 12, Intel is highly under valued.  I'm adding more to this one.23 years old and started trading a few weeks after the big drop w/ a Roth IRA and individual brokerage account. My philosophy has been to only invest in companies I really know, and as you can see, it’s mostly tech lol.

I’m planning on adding $1k to this in a few days and still figuring out how I want to spend it.28 years old; approx 70k USD saved that I plan to put in stocks this month; I was trying to create a diversified mid to long term (5-10 years) growth portfolio (would be nice to be rich one day). My risk tolerance is high (already have an apartment paid for; no need to save for housing in the future) but I would be happy if I don't lose more than 50% (worst case scenario) to cover unexpected costs in the future. This is what I have come up with so far:

FB 25%

MSFT 10%

BABA 10%

TSLA 10%

ENPH 10%

APHA 10%

PINS 10%

GAN 7,5%

AMRS 7,5%

Also planning to add 7k of sth payments related in the future. Probably PYPL or maybe V/MA/SQ.

Any advice to the overall portfolio from you experts would be appreciated. Thank you :-)Canadian TFSA investor (Don't have to pay tax!)

I saw they were all relatively low for the 5D/1M charts and trending upwards, plus I've heard they're stable stocks (except UAL, I don't know about that, but I figure airlines will go up).I have a question for TD Ameritrade account users,

I applied for a Margin Account on TD, but im kind of tripping out because I dont want to actually use margin and get hit with a 10% interest rate. I just want to use the cash I get from selling a stock instantly.

With a cash account, Im forced to wait two days before using the cash I recieve from selling a stock to purchase something else. After doing some research, a margin account allows you to get this cash instantly, my question is, do you get charged interest on the cash you use after you sell a stock instantly? Anyone have experience with a TD Margin account but you dont use margin?This is my first week investing, but I've managed to build a small portfolio of both safe long term investments, and a few gambles here and there:

I know it's a bit messy, and it's not a lot of money, but I am young so that was all I could afford. I will try to upgrade it in the upcoming weeks.Started to build this initial portfolio back in March and have been/will be DCAing into the ETF holdings every two weeks. MSFT is in my taxable brokerage, and everything else is in a Roth IRA. DRIP turned on for everything with no plans to sell, only build onto. My timeline is long term, 25-30 years and I'll be maxing the Roth contributions annually, in addition to contributing to a separate 401K. 

Unless this current situation actually works out and I get put on the management fast track at Cinnabon, of course. That'd be the icing on the cake.

I’m just starting out on the stock market (19M). Currently planning on investing about 3000$ with a possible dip on the horizon. I wanted to get some feedback on the stocks I’m eyeing. Planning on a 60/40 split in ETFs/IndividualStocks. 

ETFs: VOO(500$), QQQ(500$), ARKK(500$), SPY(300$)

Individual Stocks:
MSFT(600$), FB(600$), AMD(200$), KO(100$), Air Canada (100$)

I would greatly appreciate any feedback on greater diversification and potential contenders to beat out my selection.I like it. I think Covid-19 May be accelerating certain technology trends but also I would advise any stock buys be made with a long term mindsetI would recommend just buying regularly and not trying to time the market too much. But of course, if the market is down 20-30% you could invest a little more, just don’t rely on this strategy because some of the time you will be wrong.28, investing for three years.

I'm really new at this; any advice is appreciated! I wish I had invested less in CCL and CNK, but that's just a waiting game at this point. Looking to buy from one more company, but not sure which one yet. 

Thanks!!Mostly focused on 1-3 year returns.

It's very tech-heavy, but I am not a big believer in the 'tech bubble' theory.24 year old new investor as of this summer. Half of my savings from my past 3 years of working are in my TD Ameritrade account for use. Lost 5K in stupid panic selling, won't do that again.

Portfolio is long term (1-2 years, but who knows) with a basic covid recovery strategy.

Current Holds:

BRK/B - 50 shares

JPM - 100 shares

&#x200B;

In case of a second big crash or dips, stocks I'm eyeing to get into at certain target prices are:

LUV

AMD

AAPL

AMZN

TSLACan you comment on my portfolio? I have just started in Jan'20. Mostly small\\mid cap tech\\cloud companies.I guess it is too much tech? Apart from this I have enough diversification already with RealEstate, Gold, Fixed Deposits (5.5% yearly interest) and Mutual Funds in my home country. So these stocks are really to generate alpha and not to preserve capital. Gradually I will start allocating more capital to these stocks - is the risk justified then? Or should I also add maybe an index fund like QQQ to balance it out?

In the descending order of allocation, major ones being TEAM, TTD and TKWY.

If you don’t have THAT much capital invested at the moment, is it better to spread it out or consolidate it?

Also: any recommendations for other ETFs?Nice and simple with an aggressive growth tilt.

VYM 2After a trial and error, I've been trying to stick to adjusting my portfolio once every quarter. Below is a list of my Q3 Portfolio. This quarter, I replaced BYND and ALB with APRN and WMT. Let me know what you guys think! This account is for individual stock investing only and I'm a low-risk player (yes my portfolio is boring). 

* MSFT (21.5%) - Cash King, #2 Cloud, WFH and untact environment continue to push Microsoft up.
* AAPL (13.1%) - Another Cash King. Apple Republic continues to grow with its service business, and departure from Intel Chips. 
* TSM (11.1%) - "We do not compete our client" #1 Chip manufacturing and possibly the biggest benefactor of the broken Apple-Intel aliance.
* T (11.1%) - Reducing debt, selling bad businesses, possibly the next hot item of Elliott Funds? Let's see how HBO Max does.
* JNJ (10.3%) - Cash King, no debt, lowest leverage business. Healthcare/Consumer Staples giant
* PEP (10.1%) - #2 in Beverage but #1 in snack. Everyone is munching snacks at home. Fall in beverage sales is covered by the rise in snacks sales. 
* IBM (7.3%) - Only got the Plan A and no Plan B, but that Plan A seems solid. Could they follow the path of Microsoft, or are they just another General Electric? 
* WM (6.4%) - Waste King. They outmatch all of their competitors combined.
* APRN (5.6%) - Could they benefit big time from COVID and people not eating out as much?
* WMT (3.5%/ to increase to 10%) - Offline giant is taking bigger steps at challenging the online giant. Could this work in their favor?For all my value investors out there... Based on Warren Buffett's philosophy of intrinsic value and future earnings growth, can anyone familiar with this take a look at $CAH. It seems like a no-brainer value play with minimal downside from my calculations. Im getting somewhere around a $70 fair value price target, it's at $50 right now. Not to mention it's paid a dividend for 37 years and has less than a 40% payout ratio.Due to the current red day in the tech sector I figured I would seek some advice on my very tech-heavy portfolio. Sell? Hold long term? And feedback would be greatly appreciated.

25% SPY[deleted]Just started investing this week. I've graduated from university so I don't have much, just 2k that I have saved up from a part time job.

I decided to buy:

1 stock of Google @ $1515 
1.1 stock of Apple @ 386
1 stock of AMD @ 55

I'm looking at medium - long term growth. I don't need this money for 2 years at least so I have no problems keeping it in there for that long.

Once my pay cheques start coming in I plan on investing more broadly into Microsoft, visa, MasterCard and waste management slowly at a time.

Any tips or advice?

Thanks guys.Very new to this. You can roast my shit if you want, anything that will help me learn what I am doing. Thanks :)

That's it. Holding the rest in cash. Waiting.Very new investor. Before the pandemic, my only experience in stocks was being gifted 19 DIS shares in 1996 (thankfully, I've held ever since) and enrolling in the ESPP with WMT (can't argue with that 15% match). Came into excess money thanks to the stimulus check and lots of overtime as an essential employee, so started buying stocks at the very bottom in March. Currently investing an additional $10/week, more if I can afford it.

Any thoughts. I’m looking to hold 25+ years!25 years old, been aggressively saving for a while. Trying to build a long term portfolio geared towards growth and some Blue chips for compounding. Pretty much have the value side built out. Tech is just so high right now I'm finding it hard to jump in at these levels. That's why I'm sitting pretty high in cash. Probably hope for a 5-10% pull back and just start averaging in to tech/growth.

Wondering about buying PFE after recent drops.

EDIT: Bought Pfizer (PFE) for 35.30.Hey guys, I'm trying to diversify my stock a little more with 1 or 2 more stocks in different sectors like energy/finance... Right now, it is a little too focused on IT sector i think...I would appreciate any suggestions. I'm looking for long term stocks (\~10 years) with decent dividends (2\~3%). Please also chime in if you have any suggestions for my stock portfolio in general. (This is stock investment only and I am investing decent amount (13%-15%) in 401k that follows other indices/equities/commodities)

How’s my portfolio? And any recommendations for shorter term investments?What to keep?  What to sell?  Any recommendations based on what I already hold?

Ford (F) - 50 shares 
MGM - 25 shares
Spirit Airlines (Save) - 15 shares
Nordstrom (JWN) - 20 shares
Kosmos Energy (KOS) - 200 shares (This is one my dad recommended when I was looking for a low price stock)I'm perma holding EZPW and SELF. These are recession stocks that usually do well during tough economic times. EZPW is a payday advance stock which usually do very well during economic hardship. Banks are tightening lending rules, so it's going to be near impossible for people to get loans. Look at how well it performed between 2008 through 2010. I don't know if you look at a company's gross profit vs cost of expenses before investing (looking at TSLA investors), but this company has been making a consistent profit even before COVID and/or the recession. They should do very well for the next year or more.



SELF is self explanatory. They focus on self-storage facilities in the Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Oklahoma area. We all know that people are going to get evicted given that the number of loans in forbearance increased to 8.16 percent as of May 10, up from 7.91 percent the week prior and that's not even including the millions of renters. That means millions of people will be evicted as  companies lay off more workers.  They will need a place to store their stuff.I’m 15 and I started about a year ago.

Thoughts?Hello,

So i've started investing over last month. Made some errors like selling ENPH when it was 40, to buy it later on after it skyrocketted after earnings or selling BABA during the China delisting talk, patience is the key as they say.

So I've tried to diversify among different industries, right now my portfolio looks like this:

* RTX - 7 - 66,22
* V - 5 - 191,24
* DIS - 5 - 121

Since i am investing from the Europe, $ dropping is hitting hard my investments, but i know that over time it'll even out. But i'd love to hear your feedback. Stocks i am looking at right now are: Ally, Nike, Shell, Cloudflare, what do you think about them? Would they improve my portfolio?Long Term Dividend Portfolio

I see a lot of people claim there is security in investing in funds, but i know little about them. It is clear that they have better capabilities in investing options that are beyond my knowledge, but because of this i find it hard to have confidence in putting my money to ETFs and the like as compared to say, blue chip type companies. I guess I'm asking if there is a good place to start in researching funds and their investment choices? I'm trying expand my portfolio, and hedge a little bit of the risk that comes with investing in only around 15 companies that i am investing in now.

Just waiting for it to drop again so I can average down as I initially had it at 114 but sold and bought back in at 125. How high do you guys think Novavax will go?70% VOO

30% VGT

I have been considering reducing VGT by 10%-15% and adding in ARKW. 

Something like:

70% VOO

15% VGT

15% ARKWRelatively new to investing. Been using Acorns for auto round-ups and recurring investments, then moving money around into Robinhood and buying fractional shares. Primarily blue chips and an ETF, but taking a chance on TSLA continuing to skyrocket (Musk is insane, but he will change the world because of it) and BA being the airliner to recover the fastest/strongest. Any advice on what I could do better would be much appreciated.

thinking about liquidating my SPAC/airlines/oil positions (~35% of portfolio) and taking positions for second wave of lockdown - more IT, biotech but i think I'll be too top heavy. thoughts?I'm a new investor who started in January 2020 and have been learning while taking a pummeling.  Portfolio strategy: identify 20 good stocks, primarily with strong dividends, and gradually fuel them until I can retire and live on the proceeds in 20-30 years.  I'm looking to invest in huge companies that will remain afloat for the rest of my life, in so far as that is possible.  Initial goal: to fund each of the 20 stocks to $1k (60% complete), then to $3k, then to $5k.  After investing $100k between all 20 stocks, reassess.  All dividends are DRIPing into new shares.

I plan to invest or have already invested $1k in the following companies: Broadcom (AVGO), Nvidia (NVDA), AMD, JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), Proctor and Gamble (PG), Tesla (TSLA), Alaska Air (ALK), GM, Intel (INTC), Home Depot (HD), NextEra Energy (NEE), Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP), Verizon (VZ), Visa (V), Microsoft (MSFT), Lam Semiconductors (LRCX), Caterpillar (CAT), and 5% into an S&P 500 index (VOO).

I inherited 6k in Lockheed Martin (LMT) and may also push that on the side.  I have $1k in Disney and will assess whether to add to that later; for now, it's not part of the plan above.College student with $1200 rn, put around half into stocks.

So clearly if I sell now I’m screwed, but do you think I’ll be fine in the long term? New to this but some advice I’ve been given is to not freak and just hold. I plan on holding this long term as I won’t need cash for another 4 years and by then hopefully I’ll have job and this will be play money. If I’m doing something stupid lmk, I’m learning with khan academy and Bloomberg market concepts rn and will move onto books afterwords. I’ll also be majoring in quant economics so maybe that’ll help me too.opinions needed

23 years old and in it for the long run. I have a government job, so I will still have an income for the foreseeable future. Can shoulder some risk.

All purchased on 14.04.2020 for a total of just under 6000€, now at around 6900€ or so. Couldn’t purchase earlier because it took so long for my trading account to open, kinda bummed I missed the (first) big dip on 17.03.  
My portfolio is up 15% since purchase, the big winners are definitely Amazon, Docusign, Microsoft and The Trade Desk.  
Buying American Express must have been some kind of brain fart after a long day at work; I meant to buy Mastercard. I’ll sell American Express when its price is back up and plan on buying Mastercard in the meantime.

My aim was to build a portfolio that is diversified over multiple industries and regions. However, I’m betting that companies offering products/ services needed for home offices will grow strongly due to more people in the future working from home. Also investing in Fintech because I’m certain more people are moving to pay with their card in the future due to hygiene concerns.

I was only able to bear a 6000€ investment in the beginning because I plan on purchasing a motorcycle, but I plan on investing some money every now and then.I'm one of those Robinhood noobies who joined fairly recently. Enjoyed the rise, panicked when it fell and made some bad trades, much more level headed with that experience a few weeks ago.

Currently own CCL, NCLH, UAL, AZUL, PLUG, ZNGA, INO, APHA, TXMD, TNK, YELP. 

Still learning the ropes, but am now below my initial investment, any/all advice appreciated!I am a 20 year-old B.S. student finishing this coming spring and I started investing with Robinhood in March this year. Currently I am holding a total of ten stocks. I am trying to grow my portfolio to become financially independent by 30 (with a job). I have been focusing on a mix of bluechip stocks for long term holding + dividends and volatile/cyclical stocks for short term value trading. Any tips, suggestions, or criticisms are welcome and appreciated!

Thoughts 

I am 34 and just started investing about a month ago. I only threw in about $1500 to start. I have a lot to learn and am willing to learn. I have started reviewing some of the stuff on this sub-reddit to that end. I think I need to invest in more long terms things. Mutual funds? Bonds? I am still learning about all of the differences but trying as hard as I can given the very little time I have due to work.

Apologize if I am formatting this wrong. I put in the number of shares for each. I plan on putting away some money from each paycheck to this fund. I also have a 401K with around $10K in it at another company and about $30K put away but the latter is going towards a home in the next year or so. Any advice at all is appreciated. And thank you ahead of time for everyone's activity on this thread. I have been learning a lot the last three weeks or so.I've invested a little bit over the years. Overall in a great financial position, but this is the first time I've had such a substantial amount of money into stock or ETFs. 

I'm in the fortunate position to work for a company that recently went public about two years ago. I sell a a bit of company stock every cycle to diversify. Therefore, I've been sitting on a bunch of cash. I've used the extra time I've had on my hands to finally fully diversify my investments.

I'm in my late 20's so I'm looking to hold most for long term investments. I put $1000 intoeach company or ETF and slowly put in money into the higher performers. It's very heavy in tech, but it's what I'm most familiar with since I work in the industry. Also the coronavirus has accelerated everyone into the digital age.

I thought about sellling CCL and maybe also SAVE to switch to energy or tech (PING for example) as corona news are getting worse. On the other hand hopes for a vaccine are rising though and CCL and SAVE confirmed that they could survive without income for months, maybe even 1yr+. I got both pretty cheap (CCL 10,25$, SAVE 11,57$) and should have sold them when they were at about 25$ some weeks ago - but afterwards you always know better (or do we yet?).

Also HEI, OMV and DOC are everything but safe concerning the rising corona spread.

I was also thinking about investing in hydrogen, but I don't know, it just looks too much like a bubble to me.

Any thoughts?16 year old just started my long term with $500.

I am up around 20% overall with 3k invested. Would you recommend increasing the positions I am currently in or investing in more companies? I have been watching DOCU, MA, INTU, and CHGGAny advice appreciated.  Link with photos is below.  This is my first week.  I also just sold my Uber stock for Airbus stocks.  


http://imgur.com/gallery/V3ZXfRI[deleted]32 years old and trying to make sure future me doesn't hate current me. See below current allocations:

ROTH IRA:

VOO - 40%

VGT -  40%

ARKW - 20% (bought this near the recent top and getting crushed right now, today should also be fun lol)

&#x200B;

Cash - 50% (looking to add a high risk/high reward growth stock. Any suggestions?)

Thanks in advance fellow investing nerds.Just pulled all money from Wealth Simple Trade, and will be using Interactive Brokers from now on. I'm working towards a portfolio of 80% stock and 20% ETF, as my income is going to be stable until I die.

Here is the portfolio I'm shooting to grab when my money clears through IB next week. Purchase price is obviously subject to change, but I'm working with yesterday's  numbers.

|Name|Number of Shares|Price of Share/Total|Percentage of Portfolio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|TEC.TO|1|21.29/21.29|1.6%|

|CNQ|5|17.99/89.95|6.8%|
|GAN|5|23.41/117.05|8.9%|
|||1311.09||

As time goes on, I'll pump more funds into my ETFs (they're clearly only accounting for 3.5% of my portfolio right now) to get my percentages more in line with my goal. I know that it's pretty tech heavy right now (80.5%), but I wanted to grab a few shares in these companies before the prices get any higher. Down the road, I'm interested in a few other names: BNS, KO, CTC, SBUX, PFE, and JNJ.

Let me know what you think of my starting allocation.Fssnx or FZIPX for Small cap exposure in Roth IRA. Thinking adding 10% small cap for overweight long term.

Any thoughts?  I think next month I'll buy Amazon then I won't add any new company.  For the next few months most likely I'll focus on increasing the size on some of them while adding up on VTI and ARKK.  I'll try to make them at least 30% of the whole portfolio.

Do you think this portfolio carries too much risk?  Too tech-heavy?  For the record, I'm long on all of them except maybe GILD.  The timeline is at least 5 years. 

Long term hold for continued growth:

I am planning on selling JD and reinvesting in a different stock. I heard TENCENT already holds a lot of JD. I chose WMT but decided against it because of Amazon’s dominance. Might choose a nice etf instead. Any advice?

I'm 20 years old and plan to hold for a long time. I picked a lot of growth stocks because I've got plenty of time and am confident that these companies will do well in their respective industries. I also added KO for stability and dividends and EQQQ for exposure to big tech, which I don't think will be going anywhere in the foreseeable future.

3. Roku since it is down after earnings

Hold 80-90% of it in long term ETFs. The other 10% or so I want to use on individual stocks (mainly to learn and makes some profit along the way). Just looking for opinion on strategy. Do you guys prefer to go all in on one stock you feel strongly about or spread it out among multiple stocks/different sectors? Again, newer account so it's only a few thousand dollars were talking about.Still trying to gauge where to trim my portfolio and get a good balance between diversity and shares in each position.

I know I’m probably spread too thin and should condense it down to 15-20. My mindset was to buy and hold for decades because I’m only 30 but I did some recent reorganizing when shit hit the fan in March. It was hard for me to start investing, I come from a family who only put their money in CDs, Money markets, and other types of savings accounts. I figured I’d have less risk if I picked a lot of different stocks but regretting it a little because it’s also less reward when a stock does really well. Probably going to get more aggressive and use some of the recommendations I’ve seen in recent postsBA 4 shares
CCL 2 shares

I'm in the process of trimming down my positions. Any recommendation on what I should sell or if I should just focus on the Roth ira instead of stock picking? My current strategy is mainly long term holds and DCA by using fractional shares.I don't really have a standing portfolio yet, but I'd like your opinion on how this would fare:

15% - iShares TecDax UCITS

15% - iShares S&P 500 Information Technology Sector UCITS

15% - iShares S&P 500 Communication Sector UCITS

15% - iShares S&P 500 Health Care Sector UCITS

15% - iShares NASDAQ 100 UCITS

25% - Individual stocks for speculative short or long term plays


I do realize this is a tech and USA heavy portfolio, but I am very bullish on that. What's your opinion on this if I plan to hold 10/20/30 years?


Should I go for a more balanced portfolio instead?Rather new in the market. These are all long holds, have primarily done my investing in products I believe in and see them doing very well over the next 10 years or so.

ENPH 24%

BYND 19%

PINS 15%

SHRM 3% (for shits and gigs mostly, but I do believe in the product. I just think we are a long ways away from)

The other 39% is in cash, waiting for something with good value. My plan is any of the top three stocks from above if they dip again or something along the lines of DKNG (many degenerate gamblers, huge market) or TSLA (Musk is a smart dude).

&#x200B;

Pretty excited to be in the market after years of looking in from the outside. I expect it to be a bumpy ride for a while, but I am in for the long ride!I have been investing since March.

Was looking into more long term ETFs like SPY or SPYG.  Possibly going into Raytheon aswell.  As advice would be appreciated.Bought most of my portfolio during the crash in March. I'm young so ideally looking for around 75-85% equities, 8% in REITS, 2% in Precious Metals, and the rest in bonds. I'm also thinking about offloading BBY or KO as I'm at the range where I have too many companies to keep up with, and putting more in VIGI and VOO/QQQ. I'm sitting on around 17% cash rn from locking in some profits last week, and the rest is in UBER/ACB/BETZ/NERD.

My stock portfolio, tech heavy (tempted to buy more but gotta diversify!)

SHOP - eCommerce giant only going higher with partnerships with Walmart and Facebook. Has been a recent pump but can't time the market and people have been saying overvalued since I bought it at 80. Super volatile but will get more at 600.

SQ - Fintech, huge innovation and making moves in the banking sector with loans. Starting to diversify to Europe. Cashapp is targeting under banked areas so it could be enormous if it ever secures the Latin American or African markets (far future). Plus I approve of Jack Dorsey. Good entry point it 80, and if it breaks that then next entry 60.

VEEV - cloud computing for pharma. niche market that needs their services and they do a great job. Pretty bullish on this one, 200 would be a good entry.

OKE - Bought it after the crash, people will still need natural gas for a while(phasing out coal) and it has good dividends. Pretty volatile though, will but more if it drops to 30 again.Super Small Time investor, just getting into it and want some recs for diversification. Been staying away from high growth stocks and more looking towards stability with decent dividends

Long term investor, looking for growth, ok with risk. What do you guys think?I’m curious what y’all think. I only recently started adding funds to my modest (and unsuccessful) prior holdings. 

I’m down big on the GE and HAL, let me know if you think I should sell or hold through. As you can see below, I’m big on brands and consumer staples. These ill-advised investments have long been a sore spot and I’d like to move out of them, but I fear they may recover and I’ll wish I’d stuck around to recoup my investment. 

- VOOG (Vanguard S&P 500) - 49.2%

- DAL - 16.2%

- HAL - 8.3% (down almost 50%, avg. purchase $23)

* FB - 16%
* GOOG - 9%
* KO - 7%
* MSFT - 13%
* PEP - 8%
* SBUX - 9%
* WORK - 8%

I want to add to AAPL and MSFT. I thought about selling KO and PEP to buy more AAPL/MSFT, thoughts on that?What do we think of ZM - Zoom??21 years old, mainly investing since start of this year (had my fair share of losses because of corona, bad timing I know) in Germany, total invested is a bit more than €4k

3V64 - 8.0%, 2 shares (Visa)
IFX - 2.4%, 5 shares
1UD - 2.2%, 2 shares (Teamviewer)

About half of my saving is in an ETF, rest are in stocks traded at Frankfurt. Should I rather increase some positions, like MSFT/Visa, or add new ones like Apple, Amazon, etc? Or just let it stay this way?

75% VTI
25% VXUS

I want to keep it simple and I'm 27 so I'm looking for long term growth and want all my money in equity. I have $8,000 in cash just waiting to buy the dip. Should I drop it all into my indexes or is apple or Microsoft or whatever actually worth it? Should I try REIT's or VGT instead?https://ibb.co/kJmV6kM

Would you hold?My portfolio for the long term is looking like this at the moment. Once my equity goes up a lot I will rearrange everything to put more into the VUSA ETF.
I’m new to this whole thing (started reading about investing just a month ago) so any advice/criticism is  much appreciated!

I bought it mainly for the defensive dividend payout. I’ve had it over a year and tripled my position and lowered my dca during beginning of Covid. I can see PBA returning to their pre Covid levels and continuing to be a steady firm in the midstream space but they deferred funding some of their new projects and investments this year. I think short term my dollars will have better growth and return in Covid essential companies especially if US experiences a second wave.

Took the plunge and bought PINS last week as I thought it had flown under the radar recently and is well positioned for future growth.

 To be specific about its positives:

- Positive social media platform that is growing its user base 
- Particularly popular with women 
- As people move away from Facebook there will be more of a demand for positive social media 

And the negatives which I acknowledge:

- Inflated P/E ratio
- Can realistically never be as big as Facebook 
- Not guaranteed to be able to monetise new users (although ad revenue will increase)

How am I doing? Something I should be considering? I'll prob end up getting QQQ as well. Love tech long term.Pretty evenly spread out. I'm a long term value holder but I'm curious to hear what you guys think.

All pretty balanced across the board. Most shares in STWD. I’m concerned about the market. Thinking about liquidating.AMD: 6 shares: avg cost $48.92

ADPT: 7 shares: $41.04

TSLA: 1 share: $981

MSFT: 5 shares: $178

SPYD: 5 shares: $27.73

Just looking to get peoples opinion on my portfolio, I will be keeping MSFT, APDT, and possibly SPYD long term, the others are short term for me. I invest about 100-200 dollars a month. I’m 25 years old! Any feedback and constructive criticism is welcome!Super new to this, so I've mainly focused on different Vanguard ETFs for now. Thoughts?

VTI - 26%

VIOV - 17%

VONV - 17%

VXUS - 16%

RHP - 12%

(Doesn't add to 100% cuz I have some extra cash in the account at the moment).This is the portfolio I'm considering for my Roth IRA (I have different holdings in my trading account):

**SCHX (US Large Blend) - 40%**

This is essentially the core of my portfolio. Solid large US stocks

**QQQ (Tech) - 15%**

This is a tech/growth tilt because I'm young so I figured I should try to soak up as much of this growth as possible. I'll probably reduce this position over time

**VXF (US Extended Market) - 15%**

Pretty solid mid-small cap fund for additional growth opportunity

**IJR (US Small Cap) - 10%**

This fund tracks the S&P 600. Smaller cap than VXF but more risk

**SCHF (International Developed) - 7.5%**

**SCHE (International Emerging) - 7.5%**

These funds are both just to give me international exposure. Better valuations in international markets and also growth opportunities in the emerging markets.

**SCHH (Real Estate) - 5%**

A small real-estate focused portion

Also for context, I'm currently 17 and plan on keeping money in my Roth IRA until retirementOk getting out of options and into long term shit since I am losing all my hair.

Should I not even bother with the VTI in the Roth? If not, should I just keep buying more of what I have, or add other stocks in different areas to diversify (V/MA in financial, RTX in whatever RTX is). ThanksMid-30s. One of my portfolio:

I do need to re-balance. Feeling a bit overweight on Tech sector. I'm contemplating putting my money in ETFs going forward. I'm only up about \~12%, whereas SPY is up around \~18.5%. I get that the majority of gains in QQQ and SPY come from a handful of mega cap tech stocks (which I own most of), but it seems to be beating my mumbo jumbo of a portfolio.

Any recommendations on how I should re-balance going forward? Any recommendations for good long term stocks I can add or ETFs I can stow away cash into going forward (I was researching the combination of SPY, QQQ, VTI, IWM; curious about MTUM and ARKK, though those seem riskier). Also, what do you guys think about bond etfs or corporate credit ETFs?

Pretty risky right now but I'm 29 and won't be touching this for a while. Whole premise is to weight the portfolio towards tech and renewables, with core holdings in U.S. /Int'l. whole market ETFs.

My concern: Too much overlap between VGT and ESGV, and ICLN and PZD? I know there's a bit, which I'm okay with, but I'm not sure if it's worth divesting into other funds for.

Also have 2.5% in bonds for a little hedge and although silly seeing that number change only a little bit helps me stay cool when volatility is higher in the other funds.Yes suggestions. I assume you would do your own research on suggestions gotten here.
I think there is going to be a mass of retrofitting of elevators. I think this is a spot not yet taken into consideration yet.[deleted]I (23) built my first stock portfolio over the course of last year with the intention of using it as a long term investment (at least 10 years or so). However, the rise of Tesla has boosted my earnings higher than I ever would have expected. It currently accounts for 49% of my portfolio, and a whopping 89% of my total earnings so far. I definitely have decided to sell most to all of my Tesla stock around December and January of 2019 and 2020, respectfully. I’m doing this to save on capital gains taxes, however without knowing how long Tesla’s gains will continue, I am debating whether or not to sell at least a significant amount of my portfolio now (especially Tesla) and take the tax loss, or wait it out and potentially lose out on huge earnings (65%). Any advice would be extremely appreciated.Kind of want to set this and forget it now and buy dips. As a new young investor how does this look for 5years+?

Im really itching to invest long term in a airline company like southwest or United but 

do you think they will go even lower? 

Me personally im planning on taking a trip to Europe in August. This whole cornavirus situation doesnt really scare me at all. I think a lot of others feel the same especially young people so I see air travel picking up .New investor trying to get some recommendations regarding building my first portfolio. Does this look like a balanced portfolio or should I stick to index funds? Looking to hold long term (20+ years).

Wish me luck[let it ride? ](https://imgur.com/gallery/loX3Hz0)[removed]What is the company, SU? Do you mean Suncor? Because they're Canadian based, not European.Do you keep any cash as a % of your portfolio in case we have a sequence of red days?  I'm 40% cash, which is a lot, I know, but it helps me feel prepared for red, and it kind of hedges my stocks.  Red all of the sudden isn't terrible because I'm in a strong position to buy.Overly complex. You need to streamline it a bit.BeastAny particular reason you aren't holding anything else?Very strong stocks, I would consider any new money going to diversify a little more, such as VTI.You bought all those companies with 500$?New to investing - how did you buy fractional shares? I am currently using an app called Stash but the only other one I know is Robinhood and you can't spend small amounts on it.That’s... brilliant. With no trading fees, why not!Kinda surprised with how diversified this is and there's not really any real estate in there. Any particular reason for leaving that out of the mix, or is that something you're looking at later down the line and just didn't pick up on your initial $500 deposit?Holy shit this is awesome!  I'm brand new to investing and need to diversify, but I love what you did here...I'm going to make my own version of it.You’re pretty diverse. You could pick 1-3 winners from your stocks and 1-3 etfs and have similar risk, diversity and maximize you beating the marketVery nice and safe growth  👍Neat!Do you allocate a % to cash in your portfolio?  To kind of act as a hedge if the market drops again, and you can buy more?Wow. what do you do for a living (if I can ask) to get 20 of amazon, and 30 of apple?I'm jealous of your amzn. I've got 4 shares and it's been the cornerstone of my portfolio.

That looks like a very solid portfolio in my humble non professional opinion.Very niceAdd Nvidia and that is my stock portfolioSolid. Maybe consider adding into QQQ.100% Tech? Overweight is fine, but 100% is poorly diversified.MasterCard took a bad hit from the crash, like a really bad one. Nice choiceBrother, you have an entry in half of the market.
You can take your time and cut off some suspect ones, as keeping track of such a diverse portfolio is generally too time consuming.Agree, condense the single stocks and build your etf pertfolio. SPY, VGT, etcUnload NKLA, DKNG too unpredictable.not bad at all. MSFT out tho?Sold KO, NIO and SMPL.

KO- I planned on keeping long-term but it's been doing nothing for awhile. I'm sure it ll get back to it's original place but a few other interesting options popped up.

NIO - Made some profit. Might regret it down the road selling. Only time will tell. Had a small position anyway

Bought SHLLTesla passed $1,420.69 in after hours today. That’s my signal to sell.hold tesla forever? ur nuts.Tesla has way too high weightage. It is a company that reports deliveries and not sales. Don't get too attached just because it made you a lot of 🤑Wish I came from an affluent family like that Jesus. Mom dukes made 13k a year LOL. But here I am with over 200k investment. No clue howWhat was you buy in with CCL? I’m wanting to buy them but wanting it to drop a bit. I know eventually it’ll go up but when it drops I just feel like I’m getting a better deal.Too much risk, very similar markets, one stock making up majority of the portfolio makes it non diversified.I think your portfolio lacks short term growth opportunities.  A lot of your stock picks will recover long term, but you sacrifice better gains in the near term.  I would reposition myself, and re-enter cruise / airlines once we see covid begin to abate.  A lot of secular bull markets exist right now- electric vehicles, autonomous driving software, clean energy.  You are paying a high opportunity cost.Great pick on LANDWhy NOC over LMT? Just curiousToo many penny stocks. You’re better off lighting your money on fire. At least that way you’ll get some warmth out of it which is a better return than penny stocks will deliver.I’m no expert but I agree with the other poster that the amount of penny stocks is too much. I’m assuming you are in it for the long haul. If so penny stocks are generally good for quick short term swing trading and not typically good for long term investing although there are exceptions of course. 

If you want to play with some penny stocks by all means go for it but be ready for a pretty high level of risk. You would get a lot less volatility and more consistent long term returns allocating the bulk of your account with an S&P 500 ETF like VOOIf youre into penny stocks get into SINTX tommorow morning but don’t get burnedI only recognize MGM. Why not add some tech stocks into it? Or add an etf like XLK or QQQ?Looks goodIt’s risky having money in stocks that you’ll need in <10 years.I like ur picks, I'd probably cut those positions  that are < 5% and concentrate it elsewhere in your portfolio. Looks good.

Maybe get ARKF to replace SQ, AAPL, V.Too many companies to keep up on imoI like! Which ones are you currently adding into? My RTX cost basis is the same as yoursLove your portfolio. We will be rewarded nicely on BA and MGM (RTX as well)This is the wayI would reduce CMCSA to about a 20% holding, I would then put that money into MA, V, VTI, QQQ. 

Maybe nibble on 1%-3% each
MELI, ODFLTake some profits (10% cost basis?)  from TSLA and diversify a little bit.>72 CMCSA

wouldn't mind less cmcsa and more tsla (assuming you want to be agressive). otherwise solid choices regardlessI’d ditch the SQ
PE ratio of almost 200 screams overvalued to meAggressive, but good. MCSFT is a typo right?All you needHonestly I’d just buy into arkk or arkw in addition with QQQ and call it a day.Too diverse? Can you tell me the repercussions of  diversifying?? In regards to your stocks, steady as  you go.  There are no red flags looking at your portfolio. Good luck in such a rollercoaster!!You are diverse which is good. But you have too many stocks to really follow and do the right home work. But if you can manage this then looks great.Enjoy retirement! Well done.How did you get this 'information' and what made you sell everything in Jan: Perfect time and buy everything in March: Perfect time?Nice work. My bigger curiosity is how you got to 39.7 mill to begin with.If you are short term investing I would be scared that these companies are a bit inflated after all the people buying at a low price. However I recently thought the same for AMD but they seemed to rise after I made the same prediction.I would consider some diversification, even though these are good stocks that will most likely appreciate (excluding SHOP, far too overvalued), this portfolio is 100% tech so I would consider some stocks in other sectorsLong term good stocks. You could put 500 to 1K in and take some more risky or volatile stocks: travel related. Just sell when it gets over valuedI like it. You obviously know what you want and what industry you believe in.A little ETF heavy for my taste and I'm not personally a fan of $KO, but you have some great picks and good diversity. This is a portfolio I wouldn't mind having.Look fine.What do you see in ERIC that you like so much?[deleted]MSFT ?Is US Oil Funs USO? In the long term, I am not sure if it good to have this, given the volatility of oil prices and oil prices stuck around 30-50. I am also not a huge fan of financial companies, because of high dependency on interest rates. So really good tickers in your portfolio. Glad you have Shopify, Nio and Beyond Meat! Good call[deleted]Fuck this  I’m all in on one stock and riding that bitch>BA 6.9 shares (nice) / 18%

Nice

Pick your favorite bank, eliminate the rest. Pick your favorite airline, eliminate the rest. Get rid of BP.Drop the weak, low margin industries (airlines) and the cyclicals (banks).  Keep high profit margin companies with good moats (AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, etc.)With only 2 shares of Delta and 3 shares of Boeing, you don't have a huge amount of money in airline stocks, but right now I won't touch an airline/cruise line stock until at least the fall into the winter. There's too much uncertainty in the market right now with a possible second wave and if there is a second wave of COVID then how hard the economy will be hit.  

I just think it is premature to invest in the market, especially airline stocks which are the most vulnerable right now, without a good idea of how COVID will affect the economy in 3-4 months. The recent sell off in stocks I think is an indication of this as wellExcellent that you’re actually investing super early in life. That’s the most important thing, and never stop putting money in that brokerage account.

As for your portfolio, I’d say that you’re doing most things right. Keep most of your money in SPY and only try to actively invest (purchase individual stocks) with a portion of your portfolio, no more than 20%. 

I’ll be honest here.. you’re probably going to lose money in the long run attempting to pick individual stocks. But if you’re passionate about it, it’s a great hobby. Keep it up.Other than a targeted retirement fund (that automatically invests in domestic and international large/mid/small cap companies) with Vanguard for my roth ira, my main stock holdings on robinhood are VGT and ARKK. In my opinion, technology will be the industry that continues to boom throughout our lifetime. Keep it up!Look at SKYYAnd how it is going? What is your return for 1.5 years?With a narrow strategy, you'll need to follow the news for these companies on a daily basis. I think a move to perhaps 5 stocks would be helpful without being too cumbersome in the long term.SPCE is gambling.  TSLA may be due for a fallback.  Would put more QQQGreat choices but i think majority of your holdings can be found in QQQ and ARKW/ARKK.For defense stocks look at LHX. I believe it will rally to 255 after it breaks out of downtrend. For tech watch ROKU it can get to 240 in 2021-22. Finance JPM is the safest and leader and part of DOWJ. Good industrial choice. BA, airline that works with military, in DOWJ, down more than it should be b/c current situation, 700+ 2024-25 add every chance. ARKK very good choiceyay!Tesla is pure gambling.. Would never ever invest again with TslaI'd up your % on MSFT.  I think Amazon would be good too.I think many people make the mistake of just thinking about it as "tech stocks". "Tech stocks" blurred the lines in alot of sectors including finance, automobile, industrial (3d printing/robotics), medical/genomics, communications, entertainment, AI/ML etc.

Disruption oriented ETFs like ARK funds will be a very smart bet long-term.I don't think it's remotely too late.  Tech stocks might be overpriced at the moment but tech isn't going anywhere.Yo imma be honest. People are just bored during quarantine and have nothing to do. The bubble’s gonna pop soon enoughHype is not real. Believe in the companyno.What's your approach? Is this a long term (10+ years for early retirement), medium term (5+/- years), or short term (less than 2 years)?Are you single?>amzn

how much(when) did you get amazon and google at?I like it a lot 👍🏼I like it, seems a little tech heavy so wouldn't kill ya to diversify a bit more but technology seems to be the safest industry moving forward so you should be good as is also.If you are in it for the long haul then why buy sphd instead of just buying spy.
It tracks the underlying worse and generally goes up way slower. Before you reply with "think about the nice dividends" just think about the fact that what you are doing with a high dividend Index is paying taxes on those gains right now which means less is available for reinvesting. Overtime that makes it way worse. I know it is more fun to get big dividends, but having your stocks actually go up is also fun.If I was in College I wouldn't be investing only in dividend stocks. I'm 33 and I'm still fairly risky with my money. At an early age its better to be risky than make barely anything imo. I'd switch to dividends when I need that income and safety at an older age.  I do have some dividend stocks but a small percentage.  This is my strategy hope it helps.As a fellow college student I believe total returns is most important and at our age focusing on dividends is unnecessary.Why don’t you invest in ETF to diversify more? For financial sector I invest in XLF.I think MMM may go down a little further when Q2 results come out....T....it's OK, it's a cash machine, but the principal won't grow, you can easily get 4% elsewhere, and I'd take that over a 7% little-growth company that doesn't have plans for the future expect to continue being a cash cow. 

This thread is very tech heavy and don't feel pressure to join them.  Many of those stocks are overpriced.

Until you get a feel for how some stocks jump around, maybe you wanna try VYM,  vanguard high dividend.  They yield is around 3.7%, which is high for it, it bundles the high yield ones like T with CSCO, HON, ADM, CAT, and other lower-yield stable companies.  

If not, I'd add a utility.  SO, for example, has been paying dividends for 72 years and recently fell with the recent market drop, and is now at a 5% yield.  VZ also fell at is at a 4.6% yield.  I would put money into those. You'll get growth and income.

Once people realize there is no place to get income, utility stocks will shoot back up.Amazing company, stock overpriced. Dont put too much.Love AMD, but I never make a "statement buy". I generally buy in stages, especially in this market. I put in a 1/4 position, wait 2-3 weeks, buy another 1/4, then wait for earnings and put in the other half. Obviously there's some flexibility in there, say, if the market crashes over 7%, but that's my general timeline  Doesn't always pan out, but I've saved myself plenty of money, most recently on $PENN. Bought 1/4 position at $25, then it dropped to under $4 in March where I put in the rest. Brought my average down to around 9 bucks now.Depends of the cycles you are in. AMD beats INTC.  I have lost more than gain in the past.

Latest position paid about 30. If I am not watching it it could go other direction.All large cap like some said earlier. Checkout some growth stocks for risk/reward. Maybe sell those sub 10% positions of large caps that make up 15% of your portfolio.

[Visualization to see the sub-10%](http://www.portfoliorater.com/chart/5eea559a62745e0017ce9f3b)Good diversified start! I really like AMD at these levels. With the release of the PS5 and new xbox this holiday season...i think AMD has a lot of growth.Good blue chip portfolio. My only recommendation would be to look for some small-large cap exposure, you're almost completely US mega cap.

What are you referencing with the Fed?what is the idea of having 1 share?I’ve been thinking of doing that same with my BA!DKNG doomed  BETZ is a better choiceGreat entry points 👌Looks like you are into payments/e-commerce. I would check out Wex.What’s your annualized return? Also, have you benchmarked? If so, what’s your return against the benchmark? 

I love TDOC but that’s a huge position. If you’re comfortable with it, go forth but if it was me, I’d pare back. Also, this is just me, by SPCE is a bad investment in my opinion. It’s a huge risk, huge reward. In my completely arbitrary guess, I’d say there’s a 75% chance it goes belly up in the next 10 years and a 25% chance succeeds. You and I share 8 holdings so those positions I love lol.Looks good to me. IBM and GM are considered dinosaurs, but to each their own. 

My only advice is to HOLD(until at least 2022). Do not sell when it goes up “too much”, and do not sell when it looks like it is going to crash.IBM and GM are under-performers. Cheap stocks are cheap for a reason. NKLA is all hype and hope at this point, the winds could shift against you very quickly on that one. I am watching that one over the next few years myself, but I’m not one to invest in a company with no revenue. Maybe consider a close-in stop loss on it at least.

FSLY is probably the best pick here for growth. Deserves to be more of the portfolio imho.Not sure about PM. I also think real estate has better future than oil so I like your O. I own T as well, I think it's great long term.Although great companies, I would be a bit apprehensive about Tencent and Alibaba, due to political angle. Huge fan of MSFT/AAPL. QQQ is the new kool aid!That's awful heavy on stitch fix. I don't discourage you from owning some but I'd suggest having 10 percent in one stock at most. I'd like to see you get a bit more diversified. Do you like Ford and Macy's long term? 

Not a huge fan of any on your hot list. I think you can do better. Keep searching.You have SQ. I’m hearing a lot about a major competitor FOUR. Thoughts on it?not a huge fan of tech stocks right now not gonna lie. There still seems to be high demand for tech stocks right now but I think we're on the tail end of a ten year bull market on tech. I would be weary of MSFT - might want to get out soonLove Trade Desk. Unfortunately I sold my position, albeit for a solid gain, a few months back. I just can’t bring myself to hop back in at its valuationThis portfolio scares me, it's way too focused on a certain type of tech company.  Extremely high valuations, no dividends, some of them don't make money.  I'd say you need to take some gains and diversify. One day companies with P/Es of 100+ doing something that is not a wildly new concept will not be in style anymore, and you're gonna be screwed if that's the case.Everything could be considered tech the further we get into the future. Others will disagree. Tech is a long term trend and isn't going anywhere. I like your portfolio, but would diversify some.Why you had choose these?Hi so just my 2 cents here but you could probably take on a little more risk if you’re 19. This is a super super safe set up which isn’t a bad thing but you do have the 30 years to sit on a stock and wait for it to blow up. I’d say if you want to stay safe to just put more into your ETFs maybe keep SQ NVDA and add MSFT AMZN. I think you would be equally as safe but have better results. I do suggest a little risk in there but then again it’s your money not mine.

Good luck and have fun investing!1st welcome to investing. Starting to invest 2 months ago was great timing. There is a lot of risk in this portfolio but a good change for some bounce plays. I would not hold long term some of them though. While you do have a long time line ahead of you, I would like to suggest for your consideration, VTI, QQQ, ARKWIt is a pretty sold portfolio.IMO Facebook isn’t a good option. Advertisers are pulling away from FB, and with the new executive order, pres. Trump can punish FB for biases, which he claims they have. I’d go for SNAP or TWTR.% is for weight, but nice to see your gains.This fairly resembles my planned breakdown, except the VBR.

QQQ 40%, VTI 30%, ARKW 10%, WCLD 10%, VYM 10%We have ARKG and have done well.  In addition to ARKW please consider OGIG.Everyone posting here should just copy you.Your goodYou reckon its worth investing in tchef/fmc1 right now?Even i'm new to investing, but if i was at your place i would sell 20% of NIO and buy MSFT.Yes trade off at least a portion of nio (if you double your return cut half) for something like MSFT, ADBE and even cut ATVI it's back around to all time high in the 80's. But I wouldn't make it to drastic, keep around 5% and use the 2.7% to help put towards TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, ADBE a larger tech play that will be safe through covid or without it.I'm with you on ADBE. As a user of their products for 15+ years I can't see them losing their dominance any time soon. Two positive earning reports this year despite everything and more people looking to work from home and/or freelance makes me think they're built to last.Would add arkwHey, maybe keep MCD and YUM. You have a lot of tech as it is. Look at all of the portfolios here, they are all loaded with tech. Can you see how something could go wrong?We've been doing well with ACES for a clean energy ETF so far, but it doesn't have XEL or NEE as a top 10 holding.  ECLN has XEL and NEE as top 10 holdings, but the share price has been pretty stagnant over the past 5 years.  Other ETFs I found which included XEL and NEE as top 10 holdings were not clean energy focused (general utilities, mid-cap, etc)Looks good to me , but looking at you portfolio may I suggest $qcom. They will be making 5g radio chips.Would get out of nikola. I just can’t see what investors expect to see when they’re 2 years out from a product/revenue.

Is the plan to just hold for 2 years and miss out on opportunity cost?How did you get 8k at 19 yrs old?I'd definitely check their annual management fees, could be costing quite a lot. Otherwise, they seem pretty responsible!I'd throw in an ETF or two, CAC is looking ok atm and have a look at airlines, they're gonna be on the rise as travel picks up again.. I'm betting on Airbus, Lifthansa and United Airlines but have a look for yourselfHow much in total?Solid portfolio. Visa and Microsoft are both great companies but have mid 30s P/E ratios so the growth is pretty well priced in. I own Visa shares personally and see it as a stalwart with solid growth potential. They also reliably buyback shares and increase dividends. Walmart is pretty well positioned too, and is probably a little overlooked with Amazon taking off. I like that these are higher percentages and your core positions.

Moderna was a calculated risk and it looks like it paid off. Congrats!

I like Uber in concept but I worry about execution and competitors in the space. Something tells me a gorrilla like Google jumps into the mix at some point since they are heavily invested in mapping and self driving cars. Uber is putting a lot of eggs in the selfdriving car basket and the compeition is fierce with rivals like Tesla, Google, Lyft, etc. For me its a no touch.Honestly I like it.  A bit tech heavy for my taste as 30% of QQQ is also TSLA/AMZN/AAPL/FB, but another ETF or a few stocks from other categories can help diversify.You may want to add a bit of high quality tech to your portfolio (think FAANG) or even QQQ to create a bit more upside but otherwise you’re fine. If you’re planning on holding it for the long term, don’t sell (and especially don’t panic sell if the market goes down again)You're smart. i have a feeling there will be a second wave (third as well).Get some money into DXCM and ABMD. No Brainers.What price did you get into DIS and ERI?Good batch of stocks. I own several of them as well. Regarding your watchlist, be careful with BMO as it has tons of loans outstanding (the most of any Canadian bank) in the Canadian oil and gas sector. And the Canadian oil sector is dying a slow death. I own TD and RY.Nice buy with CCL. If it drops back down to 15 I’m buying some stocks.I'd sell your czr stock and buy into eri before they buy out czr and become the biggest casino company in the US, price is expected to hit around the $100 mark by the end of next year. 
Las Vegas casino strip is set to open on Thursday.when did you get BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY  stock?Seems too conservative. I would add more growth stocks and get rid of PINSNKE, is great, sold in early March preparing for the worse and regret not buying in but I made different moves that have still worked to my favor. I like DIS especially sports coming back with no fans. Means more content sold through DIS(ABC+ESPN) same thesis for T (NFL Sunday ticket).
INTL solid data center growth, with IoT and 5G still rolling out  data centers should continue to grow. (reason I bought in around 60.) 

ATVI I like the company, sold off at 74$ from when I bought early in the year at $46. The CoD franchise is solid but recent ones flopped up until Modern Warfare. It almost still did until WarZone. I need to see/hear plans for the next one especially when TTWO has 2K that sells every year, GTA always a money maker from microtransactions to the new one expected to come soon. Then they still have niche markets that pay up (red dead, borderlands, La Noire,etc.) I do like seeing more of ATVI classics coming around (sales on Crash TeamRacing, and release of Tony Hawk originals should be a nice little boost.I would exist AAPL FB and MSFT if profit is more than 30% 
DAL price will take longer to be back like the old days 
I recommend you focus on one area like tech stocks, this way you can keep up with the news. 

Always do your own research 
Having 50% cash is always good so you can hedge the account in cases like yesterdayI would consider a stock that is participating in the war on cash. Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, Square, JPM. They are Fintech and Banking. I am sure you know them. Do you use cash more or card? Do you venmo your friends if you don't split the bill? Those are some questions I asked myself before investing in them. I personally own all of them. I started to after seeing costco switch their credit card from AMEX to Visa. The decision was reinforced after seeing how everyone was going crazy with collecting miles and points on their credit card... One person wanted all the points so they'd pay the bill... then everyone would pay them back through venmo.Check out illuminaYou should look into investing in more tech companies and Gold the market is bound to crash in this decade and ETF's are a bad idea right now. You should watch Black Swan 1 minute to midnight on YouTube. Very informative.Look at putting 5% into ABML for that higher risk high reward (not really that risky IMO)I can't take your dividend portfolio seriously with 44% in RCLMost of these stocks don’t really have growth potential and imo you over diversified. The growth stocks in here are Uber, Square, maybe Activision and Nokia.KO AND T are very stable stock but I would suggest you to be more aggressive buying stocks that have higher risk and higher reward like DIS or BA. MGM is good for long term as Vegas is reopening. Square is a nice long term stock if entry price is favorable. I also like XOM.SQ is a gamble. Excellent product. Disappointing financials.KO and T are good, stable dividend paying stocks. Any reason you chose united, over DAL or LUV? I would do hotels/casinos over airlines. But honestly they'll all go up in the long run. And a long run portfolio is definitely what you have.

Only other advice would be get a Tech stock to diversify. MSFT would be a "safe" bet.

Made your portfolio, looks pretty even.

[Visual chart](http://www.portfoliorater.com/chart/5ee8e2228c0e4100176eca77)I have a margin acct for 10+ years used it once. Interest is lower even @ 36% the daily interest is 0.1% of 10,000 is $10 bucks/day.   Only reason I had it if I can to borrow. In my case I accidentally bought 1000 shares of a very expensive stock with a fat finger. I sold it next day and paid a few bucks of interest.You’re doing more than most of your peers which is awesome! Best advice I could give is you have so much time on your side. You’ll thank yourself in 20-30 years that you started investing during the “2020 depression” and locked in such low prices.CASH put into something more rewarding (high dividend fund or an etf.Ditch the Boeing, going down the tube for sure.You're doing good man. I like your positions and hold some of the same. Wish I had some exposure to the FAANGS for security.You can add XLK or QQQ for tech. I dont think you should change allocation to consumer cycle. Also financials might be a bit much IMO given low interest rates for next couple of years. I could be wrong![Your portfolio](http://www.portfoliorater.com/chart/5eeff33b6523440017a6d127)

Maybe diversify into healthcare?Looks good to me! I wonder if you'd be able to reduce your risk slightly and improve manageability with some low-cost ETFs in the sectors you're interested in (banking/retail).That's a hard one. I would say ride it out bc unless the tech for teleportation comes out this year...airline stocks will raise in value againPros: Diversification

Cons: Juggling 24 (soon to be more?) companiesVery diverse portfolio. I’m salty about not catching the drop in Shopify back in April. The returns have been massive since.RTX and SQ have been good to me. Just sold BAM though, it will be steady but not sure about its growth.Looks good. Well diversified.I would increase DIS, T, MSFT, NET, DAL QCOM,BAI am a bit apprehensive about oil stocks, it could be a good value play, but there is significant dependency on oil price which in turn depends on geo-political situation. NKLA seems to be good for long term. Consider adding AMZN and AAPL on pull backs :)Love SHLL being on here, would consider looking at warrants for them if they get back to low 5sThese are great!  Get a couple shares of ETFs that can provide some index-matching returns.Amrn is shit..... anything +shit  =shitThat’s crazy!! Could be a gold mineHow did you save so much at that age?  I was broke at 29!  The only thing I really don't like is UNH.  It does really well but if I remember correctly, anytime democrats are perceived as doing well, it drops.  I remember it diving of stuff Sanders or Warren would say last year.  I don't want to deal with that.Someone mentioned MMEDF to me the other day and I took a look.. didn't seem much to me, however now that I see you've got 1200 shares of it, what makes you so optimistic about it?Why you had choose these?I love to see you are considering investing in VOO - it's a great fund in my opinion. I'm curious though, why are you investing in the market? What would you like to do with this money 3-5 years?

As a new trader I would make sure you can justify all of your investments over a specific time horizon and goal. This is to prevent you from putting the money in the market, the market going down and you having to pull the money early for large expense you need to make. You will presumably need to buy a car soon unless you already have. When you finish school, you'll need to buy an apartment and eventually a house. Are you really ready to not see 3k for the next 3-5 years? 

Don't forget the market can go nowhere in 3-5 years. As a new investor you may see the last ten years and think if you are currently at a loss you can hold a stock until you make a positive gain. However, investors in the sp500 between 2000-2010 actually lost money and that was before inflation. You need to be prepared for the event the market does not bounce back to normal after covid and there are growing pains which last more than 3 yearsI’ve started buying the top 3-5 stocks of the ARKK fund and so far that has worked tremendously wellWhat is your decision making processes? 

Why this stocks?[100% Large cap, 78% Tech. Diversify.](http://www.portfoliorater.com/chart/5efb72a82748b100177e5293)I like the overall holdings, but isn't having SPY, SPYG, and VOO a little redundant?  They pretty much have the same holdings.  I think you woukd be better off just picking one of SPY or VOOThis is actually a solid build. The only thing i would recommend is to add more shares of SRNEThe rtx and lmt dividends are awsomeQQ. Curious to know your opinion on SNAP. How do you see this in 1-3 yrs time frame. 

I am torn between SNAP vs PINS.If you are risk tolerant focus on growth stocks and not stable ones like visa.I like it a lot. Higher allocation into arkw to be slightly more aggressive with their tsla allocation if you have the risk tolerance. Or take some allocation 5-10% QQQ into arkw. Just my 2 cents.

Reason why I like it is because you’re playing tech as a whole rather than cherry picking the companies. Great call imoDamn how’d you get 5 grand as a 15 year old?in@$7.30(I've been in and out of if a few times) on PLUG, still holding. I'm not sure why it's rated so poorly, it's been one of my constant performers.

They make parts for electric motors. electric motors are everywhere. long term in my book.Wouldn’t touch WFC. Money spent there won’t earn for a long timeTech doesn’t need to be a bubble for it to go down or underperform the market for an extended period. Can you imagine a scenario where tech underperforms?You need this tool then:

[finbox](https://finbox.com/?r=elfsvun).Ark etfs are very nice.As a younger investor I like the ark ETFs as wellTQQQ is intended for short term, not a long hold.  It also has a very high expense ratio (.95), which won't matter with just a single share.  Switch that out for regular QQQ.  

My opinion is if you don't have much capital, don't diversify and go aggressive.  As you add in more funds, you can start to diversify using the new funds.I like itnot sure about the sentiment in the US for a meal delivery service, but you can take a look to GER where HelloFresh made it big thanks to COVID. Again, different kind of people, so be careful.

APPL, PEP, IBM, WM, WMT and MSFT are good calls for the future, I'd take a look into Sea Limited and AMD. Also think about other good calls for the future like solar energy and clean waterHold long term>WCLD

hold mN DONT BE SILLYEEM is an emerging markets etf that ray dalio has in his portfolioCheck out Dexcom and ABMD. Diabetes and Heart disease are the top killers of people every year and it's only going up!You try any small caps yet?MSFT or Amazon should be your highest% imo.  I like your holdings overall though. If you want some diversification I would consider some food and beverage stocks, although I don't think you absolutely need any.  I just like to have a couple.Picking all the hype stocks hahaTry looking into mutual funds if you want more diversification than that.Make sure you understand what ETF's are before going in though. But I like ARK Invest and otherwise Vanguard and fidelity yea.I’d dump BA, sell 1sh GGL, and buy APPL with expend + dividends. 

It is very important to note, maybe the most profitable information you may hear since this sub existed since pre TSLA fiasco boom, that APPL has not released a streaming device since 2017.I like what you did with MMEDF I WILL DO THE SAMEDepending on your risk tolerance. I would consider holding 1-2 year deep in the money leap calls on value companies rather than holding the stock itself. 

If you want to minimize the risk just buy contracts that are deeper in the money. Would likely open a shit ton of liquidity for you.

DAL, WFC, NCLH all look like solid candidates for it.Wow, the growth on SNPS is crazy. I'll admit I never even heard of them before.

I like TSM. Keep adding to my position[If you're into semiconductors get their supplier ASML](http://www.portfoliorater.com/chart/5f1b0c2d084bc400175d64bd)I've also just started investing but based on what I've been reading/looked into this seems perfectly reasonable.  Nothing is certain but your picks are all well established companies, and you haven't chosen too little/too many.  Different sectors as well which is good.  Should see slow but consistent returns with little to worry about.  May want to add something from further east though.  TSM, L'Oréal for example.I personally don’t love Amazon, but everything else on your list seems really good! 👍I bought a few shares of amd, average at about 61. Historically they drop after earnings but because of the shit storm that is intel, amd might stay strong. My plan is to buy amd every time it moves a few dollars, up or down, I’m tired of trying to time the marketLooks very reliable. Ditch that BA though, they had major issues from the 737 lawsuits and were in dire financial straits BEFORE covid, they were about to fail anyway. Rubbish company. Put that $ toward something fun.GAN would fit your portfolioYOu can put more exposure in technology. They bring high returns....Just curious, do you know how much value your DIS

OTIS and KNYJY — elevators are going to be used differently.I’d add QQQ and ARKW or ARKK.What’s your play with T? I have 200 shares of T with dividend reinvestment, and hold about 80 MSFT. Was seriously considering selling half of T and putting it into MSFT... but I can’t seem to walk away from that dividend lol.appears like an overly speculative portfolioDid you buy Air Canada at a good price? I thought I was getting a bargain but now it's always red. :)Depends on what price it reaches

I would leave your position if it reaches $27-30 million in the next month or two.Are you from the Netherlands? Philips, Heineken, ING, Shell lolToo many positions. Need to slim down a bit.VEEV seems solid. Maybe GOOG?Do some more research on IBM. They're not doing wellAlso if you could give me some idea as well I just started and want to hear people opinion as wellThis may not be what you may be what answer you will like but maybe try getting BMW OR VOLKSWAGEN because they are going to be making electric cars which will change the future in q big way and both paying very good dividends.A lot of risky plays here...  if it were me I would  Sell out of an airline or 2 and get some blue chips in there, unless you are fine taking the risk of some of these companies going bankrupt and holding with the potential of doubling your money over the next few years.Your portfolio looks decent. I'd maybe consider adding some market ETF's. I don't know much about Ally and Cloudfare, so can't say much. If you are looking to build this into a longer term investment (10+ years), add some consumer staples and consumer discretionary sector. Nike is a good buy while Shell I'm not so sure. Energy sector is always on a constant cycle, and it is not a bad idea to invest in them when they are on a downcycle. However, on a long term view, oil demand will gradually decrease due to increased clean energy restriction and our general shift towards electric/solar/wind/etc renewable energy. so if you are looking to hold this for a short term (1-2 years), then probably not bad. I also think Chevron might be a better investment than Shell based on their recent guidance on cleaner oil/energy, etc. There seems to be some awareness of the global trend within their leadership. These are all just my speculation/opinion though :) Do some more research!If your goal is to build a long term dividend portfolio, try adding some of the consumer staples/consumer discretionary/healthcare giants into your portfolio. There are alot of companies in these sectors that gives 2-5% dividends, also very dividend safe and they continue to increase dividends as well. Keep in mind these stocks are boring though. You will never see some crazy 5+% jump unless something very big happens. 

These would be ...like KO, PEP (I see you got one), JNJ, PFE, ABBV, UNH, PG, TGT....etc. 

Key is to look for dividend stocks that

1. Continue to increase their dividends
2. Cotninue to grow in stock prices (i.e. Altria is not a good investment in my opinion despite their high dividend).

I hope it helps :)Pretty much all of your portfolio is concentrated in big tech. Technology sector has been the definite winner, and in the near future it looks like a winner as well. However, it is unclear how things will be 5 - 10 years out, and must diversify your portfolio to prepare for this. Consider adding other sectors like Consumer Staples, Consumer Discretionary, and Healthcare. I personally don't think traditional energy and finance sector will do too good, so maybe get rid of WFC, but consider some renewable energy/clean energy stocks. Industrial should always be there too, so maybe add more WM, and consider other Industrial sector stock too (MMM/HD/etc)Very concentrated imo. One tweet about big tech your portfolio is down 10%. I'd say diversify a bit.I like your portfolio, I think it will do great over the next 3-5 years. Are you concerned that you are too heavily exposed to semiconductors?pls tell me youre not planning on holding tqqq longI like the RTX pick, overall good. I personally would take a portion of Alibaba and put into AAPL, TEAM, or TWLO. Tech stocks in your portfolio could be increased. If you're looking for an easy mid bet then JETS ETF - would consider.

Best.Anyone?IMO oil and gas is a dying industry and the airlines do not seem to be strong, long term holds. Try and look for companies with strong balance sheets with long term trendsEven if you're big on energy, 60% seems like too much risk relative to potential return.I’ve been wondering about SPR. They’re pretty hamstrung right now with the 737 max. It seems like they can financially weather the Covid storm, assuming it clears up within 12 months. Still priced somewhat low based on those risks. IDK though.are you a boomer? i don't know anyone that doesn't have 50% or more in tech unless they're boomers.If you're backtesting your portfolio you need to look at risk-adjusted returns (i.e. Sharpe ratio), not overall returns and compare it to a benchmark.ETFs that track the whole market are safer because you avoid the risk of your gains getting destroyed by a disaster in a particular sector. Technology has vastly outperformed the general market for almost two decades. And it probably will keep doing that for a while. But you accept a lot of risk by tying your whole portfolio to a single sector. What if there’s a second tech bubble? What if the current tech giants reach maturity and stop their spectacular growth? That’s why you want to have a certain degree of diversification in your portfolio.

ETFs are funds that can be traded akin to stocks and are tied to certain assets (like a bunch of stocks in a particular sector, for example). ETFs that track the value of the market as a whole are an easy path to great diversification and historically reliable gains. Look into VOO, it’s Vanguard’s ETF that tracks the S&P 500.I regret not buying APPS when it was 3 dollars cause I thought it "popped off" from 2. Had my eye on it for a while being from Austin; driving by it every time i go downtown. Anyway hope it does well, cant bring myself to buy now!

Do you see PBA reaching pre coronavirus levels soon? And before liquidating did you see it as a long term position?Here are my symbols.  I always loved utility dividend stocks but they are on sale right now while tech stocks continue to climb, so now is definitely a good time to buy.

GSK, TU, ETR, AB\*, SO, VYM, D, WPC, JNJ, NGG, EXC, ORAN, PM, MAIN, ED, TD, STAG, HON, ORI, PPL, CM, MMM, VYMI, MDT, BPYU, DUK, VZ. 

I used to own CAT, but it's so volatile, it started crashing a year and a half before this recession, and when bad news comes out, the market will drop 2% and CAT will drop 3%.  it's always more.  The only way I'd own it again is if I could buy at the bottom.  Preferably $115 or below but ideally closer to $100.

* AB is a high-income stable partnernship, so be prepared to deal with a K1 form at tax time if you buy them for the 10% yieldI'm not familiar with some of these companies but it looks like you tried to buy mostly covid impacted companies. Perhaps diversify a little into some other companies. I also saw a LOT of banks. If you like a lot of exposure to that sector, maybe pick up a financial ETF instead unless you have specific reasons for each of those banks? Happy to help if you need direction.Why you had choose these stocks? And why are they so many?>So clearly if I sell now I’m screwed

Not really.  I went through this in the beginning.  I'd buy stuff on sale and it would keep going down and then I'd kick myself for being stupid.  Well, you can't time the bottom.  3% down on Hon is nothing. It might keep going down and then in a month all of a sudden there will be positive new and it will be 10% up.  Who knows.  If you're only 3% down, you already got it on a 20% sale.

I have shares in Hon and TD.  I read TD's annual report and they seem very solid and committed to the dividend, so you're good even with the hopefully short-term decline.

You took a risk on the first two but maybe learned a lesson.  Chase high gains and ridiculously high dividends and you risk losses or dividend cuts.  Fortunately it's low $ amounts there.

KO will do well, don't worry.Very good,

But i would buy Gold for 50%, and leave 25% in cash.

Gold will rise, and you will have an ability to sold if you will need some money to put in stocks. So you will get the uprise and the money for the future stocks purchase.Honestly in the short term msft and fb look like the only good buys for me out of your short term list. Beware banking woes until September they could be a better buy then. Remember no dividends. Would set stop losses on jpm at -10% for a third of equity and go down from there. Diversify into tech but remember aapl when comparing most growth stocks in that sector. If it doesn't make at least half of aapl in the trailing 3 out of the 5 last quarters I won't touch it. Ba is fine but my 1-3 year analysis has been to refer to the defense sector of flight development and production and not private sector dominated stocks. While Boeing is a defense stock, they only hold 13% equity in their military division. Consider noc and rtx as a couple of comparisons (25% on rtx, noc is hard to tell until annual reports but usually floats between 30-40% based on the  year) Overall a 1 to 3 year hold is reasonable on ~75% of your equity. US foods is poised to make large acquisitions in the northeastern sector of the us this fall with the exit of several large competitors, if they have the liquidity to expand. But that is a pretty big if. I would beware earnings until q4 with this one but if you're gonna hold then hold. Dal is a buy for me and luv is a hold. They are the two flight stocks with the highest liquidity and asset value.

1 year analysis: 6.5: high risk of uncertainty this year with the hopes of next spring bringing higher tides

2-3 years: 7.5: there are clear risks here and clearer safe bets. Don't let the Demise of one position outshine the gains of another. Remember to have a hard look at the market at this time, none of us know what will be on the horizon.

5+ years: 8.5: if you decide at the time of your exit window that investment is still something you wish to hold onto in hopes for a brighter future, like many do, I see potential high returns for the winners here and minimal insolvency losses for the losers in year one.

The most important thing for you to remember is that following the minimum exit strategy is always more important than the maximum timeline. Make sure that you hold if that is your plan. This is important for you now because you have a lot of risk in front of you right now and many of these companies will turn to raising money in ways that reflect poorly on the balance sheet come earnings. But, if you hold out and hope for q1 2021 you may see a light at the end of the tunnel.If you believe in those companies just average down as prices drop.

Definitely a wild time to jump in but it’ll be good experience especially testing your risk tolerance.I agree with the other commenter. Buy more of those stocks as the market goes down. As it goes back up, hold the high growth stocks, or take profits, and buy value stocks.Why you had choose these stocks and ETF?I think you should consider starting with a base portfolio, stocks like AMZN/GOOGL/MSFT. Big cap names, strong balance sheets, low volatility.

Tactically, you can then consider moving into the above names you’ve listed.Wow,  
It seems to me you will have negative return starting from now. 

You don't have any real "good" company with strong cash flow, and rising sales.I think PLUG has some value. I don’t like the rest. This is a really risky mix of stocks. Even if some do extraordinarily well, you’ll likely still end up at a loss. 

Mix in some blue chips or more stable companies as well. Do a smaller percentage of the more risky stuff. Just my opinion. Goodluck though, my man!>XOM

You're off to a great start .

I would advise you to consider oil is going to underperforming for a long while.Maybe considering limiting your holding to an ETF (ie NDP, TYG, GUSH etc) medium term

I would also think about buffing up your tech holdings- APPL, NVDA, AMD, MRAM etc longtermTech is foundational in the new age of business.

Highly urge you to consider AMZN (+500% over the last 5 years)  
Behemoth of a company with no signs of slowing with their chubby hands in every sector.

Considering adding currently undervalued stocks/companies as well.  
FB (during ad boycott), but pre-election might be a good short, medium or long term hold.  
Thanks to COVID crash:  
Airlines (BA UAL AAL) COF, V, IVR etc

Im also a sucker for moonshot startups before the big profits like TSLA 5 years ago before Model 3. My new TSLA is SPCE.Recreational space travel looking to be operational in 2024. Especially since Space X will never go public.I dont know much about GOOGL and V, but Alibaba most definitely has much room for growth, and i would much rather hold for the future than sell now.Get out of Nikola, I'd say.To answer your question I would add to AMZN (hopefully on a DIP) but I would also add MSFT, ARKW

NKLA seems like something I would not hold long term. You seem overweight DIS and PINS. I would trim 10% from each and reallocate.I bought SWBI after reading in an NRA magazine of a planned split of the stock SWBI in “late summer 2020”.
https://ir.smith-wesson.com/news-releases/news-release-details/american-outdoor-brands-prepares-spin-name-and-stock-ticker-0
They already changed the stock ticker from AOBC to SWBI in June and my guess is they did that to get people buying the stock on name brand recognition. If they split the stock and as a share holder I have one SWBI and one (lets call it AOBC again) I have a feeling that people who are holding off on currently buying SWBI do to cost will see it at much lower price and be more inclined to buy in due to the upcoming election. Driving SWBI back up to presplit prices and now I have stock in their gun accessories and outdoors gear company at no additional cost. Of course, that’s all if I’m reading that press release right. Thoughts? I’ll probably hold until election and sell enough before to hopefully cover my initial investment and then just see where my profits go.I would diversify moreGet out of DIS and SFET, it's dead money. Replace with MSFT and SQToo much on GOOGL. It is a great product, but not really into generating growth.

Was looking at it at like $15 but got discouraged by a lot of stuff I read onlineYou should look what is inside those mutual funds and etfs. It looks like you own the top holdings of any large cap mutual fund or etf. Although stable,it is not diversifying risk away. I would love to have more Amazon😁>y some money from each paycheck to this fund. I also have a 401K with around $10K in it at another company and about $30K put away but the latter is going towards a home in the next year or so. Any advice at all is appreciated. And thank you ahead of time for everyone's activity on this thread. I have been learning a lot the last three weeks or so.

Do you continuously invest in your 401k? You said you have a 401k but it's at another company. 

Before you invest you should have the personal finance basics down:

* Max out 401k if you can
* Minimum 6 month emergency fund
* High yield savings account
* Roth IRA if you can

Once you have that squared away:

* Figure out your investment strategy - short vs medium vs long-term 
   * It sounds like you're going to buy a home soon. So you really shouldn't invest in risky options
* How much risk are you willing to take? In order these are the riskiest: options, index fund or etfs or mutual funds, bondsfor the amount of time you've spent I think your portfolio isn't half bad. I wouldn't worry about diversifying too much. i'd focus on building more position into MSFT, QQQ. Also look into ARKW etf. For international diversification i'd consider SE, NIO(volatile), tencent, babaso you work at fastly, fiverr, pinterest, crowdstrike, or cloudflare?would consider adding ARKK or ARKW ETF.Do you also have ETFs?
I guess a little bit more tec would be nice as well :)Might look into General Dynamics instead of BAE.Don't do daytrading...
Maximize your income and go for the long or mid term investor path. Let the money work for you and don't work for the money. Daytrading is fun in the beginning but too time consuming in the end.Sorry.. I haven't heard about almost all of these ticketsway too heavy on ba imoRisky bet with the BA, what’s your investment philosophy there?Yolo.I love this portfolio! Great work! Also like the interest in AMD. Not a fan of the LYFT pick (they’ve adapted the least during COVID), but that’s you’re small holding so whatevsWtf how are you only 23 and have this much invested?!?Yeah definitely switch out of T. 16 yr old shouldn't focus too much on dividend stocksPut it in an ETF and shift your focus to paper trading and learning. Unfortunately, you’re not going to learn much good trading anything less than $5k.I liked your previous mix better..Keep in mind these ETFs SPY and QQQ have significant exposure to the stocks you hold. Given that they are market weighted. I suggest either go with ETFs or stocks and not bothSPY is an ETF and a pretty solid choice from what I hearSo first before you risk capital , paper trade, it will help you learn the basics. Second from what I've been reading it's much easier as a beginner to use etfs to keep your portfolio diverse , something like spider (SPY), diamonds (DIA), voo, and others will keep you diverse whilst not having all your eggs in one basket. There are riskier etfs out there , that might get you to your goal easier. 
Use resources like investopedia and investing podcasts to learn the basics. 

Remember investing comes with risk and you need to do your best to hedge your bets to ensure that you do not lose everything you've saved so far. Watch out for volatility and make sure you understand each and every symbol you are going to trade. 10k and 10q forms will let you know about how a company is doing. Watch and gather information before you drive into this. I just opened my account but still haven't jumped in yet but I suggest being 100% sure with your strategy before entering and know when and how you will exit, even if it is way in the future. Good luckPerfect portfolio doesn't exi... Wait. It is well balanced portfolio. But if you are young and just starting out.. I suggest adding some growth stocks. Overall good.If you are looking for something with decent growth that isn’t tech check out RTX. It isn’t the sexiest of stock but has a nice growth potential along with a decent dividendI'm a bit bearish of LRCX - Trump admin has made it really difficult for them to do business with their APAC market (Their #1 revenue generators!)... Not to be a bear or anything, they'll probably be fine because they have plenty of $$$ in their vault at the moment.Looks good! If you’re willing to take a little more risk, your portfolio is lacking some exposure in the financial sector. Not a sexy pick, but one of the industries that hasn’t bounced back, but doesn’t necessarily need COVID to be “over” to recover in the same way that travel is.Why both Lowe's and Home Depot?This looks good -- I'd look into ARKK (ARK innovation). I'm a fan of their funds and a volatile market like this one is when actively managed funds thrive. As a long term hold, keep in mind these have like 0.43% expense ratios but I've been very glad to park some money in them until something regarding normalcy returnsToo much ark imo. Would consolidate some into QQQI would say try to get more MSFT. so much VOONot bad! Cannabis sector is shit though.i was considering it a while back... I have 37 shares for TWO and don't wanna make the same mistake. i dunno if i should buy MFA shares or not. :(Could be a long time before these rebound, when you could be earning immediately on tech / COVID stocks / QQQ.  Look at the 3 month chart of DOCU for example.Solid, all kidding aside your portfolio can only go up lmaoDon’t know about arkk. Rest is dope.[deleted]Way, way too much exposure to PINS. Check out ARKK -- based on your holdings, you may be interested.Lower or remove netflix and replace it with an ETF. Msft should weigh more than the others IMONot too shabbywhich app is this?QQQ and arkw or arkk imo.Or VUG for more diversification and lower expense ratio.Sorry to bother you. I’m sure this isn’t the reply you were looking for but what does the %’s mean? I’m new to all of this, just curious. Thanks!Tesla bout to dipWhat do percentages mean? I’m new so need some explanations 😅Chgg is an underrated stock with plenty of online tools for schooling as well as renting/selling books. I have been in school for a few years and have been renting books from them alot. With Covid happening alot more schooling may be shifting to online so I can see chegg growing even moreI'm going to assume tax-able account for now.  I've only done cursory glances at the stocks so take everything with a grain of salt. 

* Too many penny stocks for my liking, unless you are able to do your DD you're likely to lose money on these, especially the longer you hold them due to dilution.  They are about quantity plays and your volume is way to low to make it worthwhile.
* ERIC and NOK are playing off 5g, should payoff in the medium term but I wouldn't hold onto either of them long term.
* TWO and NRZ are REITS, mortgage at that, and dividends are taxed as such.  Not great for tax-able accounts.  Plus long term, growth vs. dividends generally swings in towards the growth side.
* PSEC stock has gone down in price the entire decade bull run, 
* Buying Airbus while airlines are in a multi year recovery and the 737 MAX could be approved again is iffy.  I'm overall okay about this pickup though.  I probably would have went BA but it's pretty much a jet liner duopoly and you chose the Euro company.
* A hundred-thousandth share of BRK.A instead of just going BRK.B is goofy since BRK.B has the potential to split again while BRK.A will likely never.  But BRK.A can be transitioned to BRK.B stock but not the other way around so you do you.

To be frank I really only like BRK.A (BRK.B), NET, and Airbus as long terms.  PLUG is interesting as a few year gamble, up to 2024 to hit their $1 Billion goal if I remember right, and a stock I own as well.  BOXL could be a hit but they have quite a bit of debt.  Everything else in my opinion are immediate sells besides the 5g stocks as mentioned.  

ETF's are your friend, they give you great diversification/safety for the price.  For example my Roth is 85% ETF's with 15% being stocks in a market I'm familiar with such as BUD/ SHW/BLL/CCK or stocks I've heavily researched and have faith in.Chegg and LVGO both took decent drops the past few days so now would be a decent time to get in.85% of my portfolio is livongo.Well, your current allocation follows an extremely common pattern known as the Daddy Diversification. The DD is essentially the blueprint for getting your father to put on some lipstick and bounce you around in his lap while he gives you a few smooches.HTZ, M and i dont remember the third have the potential to skyrocket or turn to garbage

edit: the third was JCP but they are currently in bankruptcy so that is extremely high risk.I love GAN. What’s your cost basis?Why did you pick IB over Questrade or one of the banks direct investing platforms?How do you keep up with so many companies at once?This is satire right?ALK is a sneaky nice pic if you’re willing to hold 2-3+ yearsIBM — Big Data, Watson AI, IoT

Depends on how you play the game. Myself, I'm just in on tech (info and bio), but spread throughout the world. I'm also just buying every month and not selling really. I'm young.I’m 22. Got about £100 left to spend in my portfolio anything you recommend?I know that you’re on r/stocks, but I’d suggest some in fxaix/spy and some in QQQ/VGT.[deleted]If you want to go full-on into growth (and take the associated risks), those are not the ideal stocks to have. They are stable and great long-term holds, but have already matured significantlyWhere is TSLA?I like your positionswhat does the last 4 mean?Tesla is such a rocky stock, it's going up so much but its also the most shorted stock atm.That's a lot of % in DKNG.  I wouldn't be so certain sports have a sooth return.  I could see MLB and NFL all getting interrupted and even the next NBA season is so uncertain.I would focus more on ETFs and blue chips. Like VOO, QQQ, SPY and APPL, MSFT, GOOG. Especially when it’s a Roth IRA. But some cheap and in my opinion great stocks to investing are Banks. Not that expensive but lowly rising. Like JPM, GS, MS and BAC. I hope I could help. God bless you and remember time is the most important asset in investment.Are 12 yearolds allowed to work?I’m also 14 and I’m investing on HA,T,XLK, LEVII recommend you getting BMW OR VOLKSWAGEN two very good companies that are going to make electric cars that are going to change the future. Also I recommend getting either VERIZON or a company that is going to use 5G. Hope this helpsi'd hope so. heavy in MSFTSHow do you like $rtxWhy coca cola? They are a good company but growing so slowly. Why not invest in tech etf instead?good luckYou reckon the usa will delist Chinese stoinks?Stonks>I started investing about a year ago and have really enjoyed it. Tesla is a 10+ year play which FB and Skyworks being more 5-7 year plays.

I'm curious how you make a differentiation between 5-7 and 10 year plays...To me, I generally hear long (1+ year) vs short (less than a year). I mean, 10 years ago, the iPad was a brand new product and Tesla Model S hadn't even been announced yet. How do you assess that something will be more valuable in 10 years?Read this from papa Musk: [https://electrek.co/2020/06/10/elon-musk-tesla-semi-electric-truck-volume-production/](https://electrek.co/2020/06/10/elon-musk-tesla-semi-electric-truck-volume-production/) 

This is what made me drop my NKLA stock. Also, NKLA won't be able to roll out and see real profit until 2021. It really depends on people following the hype, if you believe hydrogen powered semis will outdo electric ones from Tesla, and if you got NKLA for \~$50. (in my opinion)I have 2k in nkla that I'm planning on leaving for a long time.Watch out. Your 5k or the company will not last long. Until it comes with a product with reliable service history, good reviews, and reasonable earnings, it is premature to judge its stocks. For the same reason most analysts do not recommend Tesla stocks even.Nice. What made the decision of such a high weight of NIO for you?Flavor of the last few  months stocks became 15 year holds  lol26% into lulu seems ridiculousHigh risk, high rewardIt’s all travel related. They will all move together. Pick 1 you like best and spread the rest around. Maybe a bank/financial like JPM or PNC, a tech company you like and something else like a HON or BUD. You should never be all in on one stock or one sector. Remember to diversify by owning stocks in a few different sectors or just buy the index fund for S&P or Nasdaq.Ive been looking at the NZX through ASB recently, only just purchase some Air NZ two week before the long weekend when they announced they were adding 100 flights for that weekend. They seem to be doing fine atm, but prob will sell later as reason being, Im in it for the long haul and they seem to do fine over time and secondy they also pay dividends too.
Other then that, that same day I bought some ZIPCO and only just couple hours ago it has paid off majorly.I also hold TSM. How do the recent loss of Chinese contracts effect your commitment here? 
Even with their strangle hold on the market the loss of Chinese contracts is gonna really effect profits here.
I'm a 1 year investor so asking for conversation/adviceNVDA is not risky, Unless you got in Over 340, that's gonna take a while, just hold it.Do you think that DOCU is overvalued?  I mean, it looks like most stocks are but looking at 2019 it seems to be wayyy up.Check out banks. BAC. WFC, JPMIs TSLA in your long term holds?To have any meaningful input you should include distribution, as in how many percent in each, as well as maybe what your goal is. Based off these stocks alone, I would comment on the fact that you are almost solely invested in very stable, low beta, stocks. Which is great if your goal is to be reasonably safe from a recession. However, if your goal is to get a better payoff than S&P i would diversify into some more growth stocks.Tech and dividend don’t really overlap so well. Most tech firms use the profits to develop their product to gain market share, rather than payong out dividend. My largest input to your portfolio in itself is that there are too many different stocks, although i can’t really tell which are stocks and which are ETF’s. Anyways i would cut down and focus on the fewer, more promising stocks. Generally when people ask me how many stocks they should keep in their portfolio, it really depends on how many stocks you have good knowledge of, and have the ability to track. I obviously have no idea of your skill and how much time you use with stocks, but in my case i could never see my self being able to keep track of and have enogh knowledge to securely invest in 30+ positions.Jealous of your prices...VIAC, MGM and COF . In my profile but not at those positions.Teach me your ways you got such low prices!!Hopefully SHRM will blast offRH does have fractional shares, you can purchase in whole shares or in dollar amountswhen did you buy msft? and for how much?25% bonus on deposits ? So if you deposit 100k they credit you 125k ? 
Give me your banks name please :)Two $TSLA shares[deleted]Why so much China? Doesn’t it scare you a bit that those Chinese companies could be delisted if they are not able to have a PCAOB audit done?

This is disclosed in the financials for BABA in particular that not having a PCAOB audit harms the integrity of the audit itself. IMO I got out of any companies that the PCAOB does not have oversight on. By the way, PCAOB stands for Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.Way too much China and shitty company exposure even if this is a day trading or short-term portfolio.I like it seems like a good mix of safe (MSFT and AMZN make a good chunk) with a solid amount risky (26% mgm and 9%dkng).

[Your chart](http://www.portfoliorater.com/chart/5ee8e2e88c0e4100176eca78)

Maybe get into a life science/pharma stock, although you already have a good amount of stocks.>DKNG ?>MRO

Why marathon? you really think it'll get to $40 like in '14?isn't VIGI kinda volatile?Take a look at SPG for a REIT.Depending on what price you bought ccl at tbh.>avoid options.these are 3 great great stocks but 100% tech eh haha how many % does your portfolio fluctuate on a daily basis if you dont mind sharing?  regarding your strategy, the ETFs are never a bad idea.  if youre going to hold individual companies instead with a meaningful portion of your capital (50%+) i suggest some diversity thoughYou can set and forget right now....those 3 stocks will outperform the ETF's in 3 years, just my opinion of course.I bought NCLH at $9.50 and sold them today. I think there's potential there but it will take time. Possibly a long time. While it may not be as dire as was thought in March it still isn't pretty. Just my 2 centsAs long as it's not more than like 20% of your portfolio I would just go in now.Visa is another one of those stocks where you just buy and hold forever. Keep buying and collecting the dividends.Try to hold it at least 1 year for long term tax gain sake. Unless the stocks tank most people including myself hold them forever.  You want to reinvest taking advantage of law of compound interest.  Example I can give you is my aunt worked PFE for a few years and she had some earlier PFE stocks which she never sold. Years later(retired) she found out it was worth over 1M in value,[deleted]It's under $2, take a stab. There is going to be tons of consolidation in Mary Jane industry so high likelihood that they will either grow or be M&Ad, unlikely to go to zero unless drastic legal changes occur. For a penny stock, there is pretty low downside and quite a bit of upside. Technically they are drug dealers, and drug dealers usually have good demand and make decent money.Compare you investment between Feb 21 vs March 20 of this year compare with SP etf see if you can beat SP on the upside vs March 20 .... Most tech funds can match SP but they tend to fall more. You want a portfolio that does not fall as much but beat SP index.

Rest seems to look OK.For long term holds maybe invest in Tech / Information Technology?Actually genius not gonna lieBA
VXUS
NET
DIS
MCD
Are  all Good I'm not much familiar with a lot of stuff on that chart of yours honestly.
But at least all of the above should be solid MCD not sure how much it will make you money granted it will not go down in value either.My opinion.

THE GOOD

• VOOG  
• Several strong brand names that should stand the test of time. Buffet would approve.

THE BAD

• Heavy exposure to travel industry. Sure, you may get a 25-50% swing down the line when things improve, but when? And in the meantime, what is your opportunity cost on investments in COVID-resistant stocks.  
• While I could imagine airlines experiencing a quick price turnaround, I can't say the same for GE. COVID revealed a lot of GE's fundamental problems (not profitable, even before COVID), and until investors feel those are addressed, your losses will probably stick.

RECOMMENDATION

• You seem to be willing to take on some risk, so I might look into some small-cap companies that are on the winning side of COVID.  
• Balance your large-cap holdings with some tech. You have almost no tech, which is a losing strategy in this day and age. You're betting on theme parks and fast food in an era of streaming and deliveries.I would be concerned about F , I don't think you have to break much sweat at this price but don't expect it to go much higher.The stocks you own have significant % allocation in VOOG. Might be a bit tricky from risky perspective.Don’t sell and get DRIP then let that fractional shares ride it out until you are 60AAPL/MSFT/FB are my 3 favorite companies.Although they are all very strong and kinda different, AAPL and MSFT are both in similar sectors along with most of your other portfolio. It’s good to keep a bit of holdings in diversified sectors. PEP n COK are good holdings I’d keep themIt had a good run, I would wait until next quarter results.I think Spotify is a great stock to buy now. It seems like they will become the Netflix of Podcasts and they are moving to have video content as well. Maybe song video clips? 

They are making BIG moves, they acquired Joe Rogan, Kim Kardashian, and other YouTubers to upload exclusively to Spotify. Spotify has beaten Apple in the music streaming sector for sure and they have a lot of Cash flow from subscribers. And the subscribers keep increasing at an exponential rate. They have a ton of cash and now they are starting to make big plays using that cash.

The CEO of Spotify seems like a very capable guy as well and has a big vision.

Note that I have spotify stock and use the app a lot so I'm maybe a bit biased, but I'm giving you my opinion.Plug powercharge point, if they every go public.In my opinion broad market ETFs will provide you negative return in the next 2 years starting from now.Single stoke look up is difficult, you have to learn about very precise mathematical approach of valuation? Are you ready for it?I think you should sell. MGM, carnival and aal are all consumer based companies that need people to spend money there to turn a profit with this new wave of COVID (same wave just increase in cases) people are going to be in quarantine for another 3-4 months. Idk about you but I’m currently investing in medical supply stocks and they been doing pretty well.Drop aal imho on a spike up[Keep DCA](http://www.portfoliorater.com/chart/5ef902b8c268e6001782258f)Well, you have some income players, which I like, because internet forums usually ignore income, which has been a savior for me.I think as a general rule you would want to limit the percent a single stock holds in your portfolio to 5% and it seems like you followed this for the most part but are doubling down on AAPL/MSFT (and some others as well). 

If you are long on AAPL and MSFT then I think you need to be sure Trump will remain in office. The information technology sector has sky rocketed under Trump's tax cuts but if Biden wins this November and brings the cooperate tax rate back to what was seen in the Obama administration, I think yesterday's best performing stocks like AAPL and MSFT will start to underperform your expectations.

Just as a disclaimer: Even if Biden wins this November I don't see the cooperate tax rate returning to 35% because of the current state of the economy however the rate will most certainly go up and I wouldn't be surprised if 3 years into his term if the rate were above 30% again.Sfix....dig itFellow ESPOer, I think you're the first one I've seenOk, And what is your return so far?Interesting take on fb going into ekection whatch that IV thoughcongratulations! fb will be an interesting one for sure. these companies are pulling their ads because they can't afford the extra cost (despite the reasons they are giving). It will be interesting to see how that stock turns as their revenue is solely dependent on advertising.Can I get some tips on diversificationIf you are thinking that long of term, I would look at some bank stocks that should have some nice rebounds as the economy recovers like Citigroup. Disney at $110 is also a great long hold and could turn into a >$150 stock. I would watch out on the SWBI stock, it'll go up while Biden is ahead in the polls, but a month or two after he wins (presuming he wins, apolitical analyses just trying to explain how gun stocks work) it will nose dive like how it dropped during Obama presidency rocketed during Trump.I would like for you to add some tech stocks, if you are planning to hold on for that long.I don't get why would you would ask for feedback when you already work in finance.Oil isn’t going to be performing well for a while. I agree! Move into more tech!Seems pretty good for a start. On the DIP I would add
MA, V, QQQ, ARKW.

If you have a very long time horizon (and are risk tolerant) you might want to consider
MELI, FSLY, NOW, SHOP, AVGOjust curious, what if tesla starts to increase 3-4% every week for next 4-6 weeks. would you buy it back for more than you sold it for?Curious why you went with AMD over tsmThrow Fastly in there tooWould switch out RDFN with some SaaS companyVIAC      Think they can make it out of this pandemic economy?   I have them as well.  Another few weeks and I may move the money elsewhere.If you have a high risk tolerance, I'd sell your LYFT and throw it into BA for the long run if it was me.If you like some risk I like PLAY and CAKE. Airlines could also be goodwould look into: NIO, SE, ARKWMSFT and V are top components of SPY. As you are young, you should consider adding some growth stocks like TTD, SHOP, SQ, TWLO, CRWD if you understand their business. Otherwise, a good portfolio!Oh God! You have a lot of dinosaurs. Personally I don’t like XOM as it depends a lot on oil priceWith your stated goal in mind, I would look at 
AWR, O, PTY, MAIN, GAINWhy not put some of the XOM into a utility. D and DUK for example, both give you a 4.5% dividend and are close to flat for the year rather than down 35% like XOM.I'm long SE (my 3rd largest holding), but 60% in 1 stock is incredibly risky. What if the worst case happens scenario happens? (they are accused of fraud, war breaks out in SE Asia, etc. etc.)Have you made returns in 6 months? What is your strategy? Long or short? Did you do you DD and chart and research news, volume, RSI, Macd?  I’m learning myself and choose my stocks and then look at Stocktwits see comments etc negative sentiment I try and stay away from... learning that emotional discipline is key to making better real time discussions...if you're ok with some losses, I'd find a way to pivot at least half of your holdings into tech. If you're unfamiliar with the companies outside of the top tier ones, i'd just invest into QQQ etf.  you'll get a great even allocation into most tech companies and their main holdings are the top tier companies. Also it's one of the best performing ETFs over the last 5 years (past performance doesn't guarantee future returns).

can't see cruise, hopsitality, or airlines recovering until there's a vaccine. gas is on its way down - even when we recover, it won't be the same. the consumer world is accelerating towards electric as we speak. you might be able to re-enter at a later time to get value ROI, but until then i think you'll be bag holding your portfolio for a while tbh. Not a fan of any of your current positions. the whole time you're holding, there are others who are seeing great ROI off tech and will be able to pivot over to value companies in a few months to double dip on the profits. I think you still have time to salvage it depending on your risk tolerance and if you pay attention to where we are in the reopening phase.I would reduce BA to 10% and consider ODFL, MELI, TDG, QQQwhy the fuck MJ? it was going down previously in last year pre-covid????????I'd add ARKW to the ETFsWhy TQQQ and not QQQ?[deleted]This is just my opinion, but I’d feel better with more weight dedicated to MSFT/AAPL, and less to AMD. I love AMD, but I wouldn’t carry it as a #1 in my portfolio. Maybe consider splitting that proportion in half and allocating the rest to NVDA? That way, you’ll maintain your exposure to tech, but you’re not having to pick a winning horse.Love the BRK. B and QQQ! McD will give them divies so well. Could add SPY if you prefer ETFs :)I’ve been eyeing a dip into MCD and SBUX, betting on the fact that despite recent store closures, they are in the best financial and brand position to recover the fastestWhy so much in Lowe's?[First person I've seen that's not mostly tech and large cap stocks.](http://www.portfoliorater.com/chart/5f0493de18e1ce001702e60a)

Think you're going for high risk high reward but watch out you'll probably end up getting burned, or more likely seeing the blue chip stocks beating your gains in the long run.)) Learn.My friend owns a small business and said PINS contacted him and helped set him up with an ad plan tailored to him. He said he's never had that happen before and was very happy with the experience. Anecdotal, but I take it as PINS moving in a good direction so I bought too. Doesn't need to be as big as FB (700B market cap) to be a successful stock!>KMB

why pick V (visa) ?  
with the Corona Virus, there will be much less consumption of goods, since many people are trying to save more or simply got to the point where they have no money to spend.  
This will go on for quite a while. it's not yet reflected in the stock I see. weird.You have a lot of investments in very overvalued stocks. If you want to load up on cash for the next crash, I suggest you reduce positions in the most overvalued ones. At least that's what I did. Gonna sell AMD today so I'll have a 40-45% cash position for the next 6 months.I also have DKNG and think it’s good long term. Except my average price is $42 😅I have some similar companies (MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, FB, GOOG). I was wondering why hold QQQ and the tech stocks individually? I just have the tech stocks individually, and was thinking about adding QQQ as well.I would keep Levi’s, it’s a strong brand and should be fine though it will likely be down quite awhile. Maybe put a little of the profits from MSFT or the chip companies in DOCU instead.I am long WFC, they aren’t going anywhere regardless of the upcoming earnings report. Actually considering buying more if it dips this weekI don’t know if it makes much sense to have both WFC and JPM.I’m not really a fan of the zero fee fidelity mutual funds. FXAIX would be my favorite fidelity fund at only .015% expense ratio, and I think it has performed better than fzrox and fzilx. Side note: QQQ is a great complement.Norweagien air shuttle is about to skyrocket soonNVAXDisney and Visa are always good long-term holds.  This sub loves both stocks.

Depends how risk tolerant you are, can’t go wrong with either. VTI will be set it and forget it.Too diversified. Toss all your tech holdings into QQQ and Arkk/Arkw at that point. 

They remove your investing bias and diversify into other solid tech companiesYou're potentially buying high, but in the long run you'll be just fine. Don't worry too much.If you’re new and already scared of your 3% loss in a volatile market in addition with a huge portion of your portfolio being tech, you need to just leave the market entirely.

Overall you should gain in the long run but if you don’t have the stomach for the volatility we’re in, the stock market isn’t for you. Especially in the current market conditions where you’ll be seeing swings that you won’t normally ever see.The percentage should be the portion of your portfolio that each stock is. Can’t provide feedback without that. 

That said, looks like the standard Robinhood coronavirus portfolio lolMaybe set a stop-loss for where you’d sell to save profit, in the event of a significant correction, but let it ride for a while, because Tesla probably has room to run.If you want safety, you can diversify into retail stocks like Costco. If you want to diversify into other sectors with a little risk go for Fintech space Visa, Mastercard, Paypal. If you want a contra play, go for some pharma company like Johnson or Pfizer or AbbvieI would diversify more. But that’s just my personal investment style. At least some of your portfolio should be in ETFs or mutual Funds. But congrats on +52%Lockheed or JPM? I’m kinda new but still have some experience those look pretty attractive to me and I own eachHonestly, I think travel stocks will get much worse before they get better. PFE might be a good hold, but it's anyone's guess when and if medical companies might pop or crash. Look at MDNA and AZN lately. My moneys been on stay at home stocks since March: PTON, ZM, WORK, APRN, which was a safe bet that paid well. Now over to gold and silver mining because of the Fed destroying our currency. These will probably rise for a few years, and they're still super undervalued right now.Too much tech exposure diversifyStill looking to keep a core of tech companies though as I don't see tech going away any time soonThe short answer is no.I've heard hydrogen fuel is still in the early stages so it might take a while to take off, and  even then it might not ever beat electric. Seems a little pumped for now, but with this market it could pump even higher. I wouldn't bet big for now, but if you're feeling lucky...I'm buying small amounts of shares occasionally. Kind of DCAing. For some reason I believe in Milton. I see a good leader.What do you think about spirit Aerosystems ?
I came here to ask the same question,
I personally dont think that it's a bad company or it will go out of business  but I do think it will take some time to get back to the 90 or so dollar a share it was at one point[deleted]SPY has exposure to oil and other sectors affected by Covid. So you may see slower growth compared to tech heavy sectors like QQQ. Isnt TQQQ leveraged? I used to own SQ, but I got spooked after they sold Caviar. I would be apprehensive about DAL allocation though- why 10%?Look into ARK etfs for long term tech exposureI wouldnt hold XOM foreverYeah, i'm not huge on xom long term for someone your age, and you are heavy on pfizer, but overall I'm pretty impressed considering how young you are. Probably should have some etfs as well, but if you buy enough individual stocks, you become diversified.Personally, I think airlines are a fantastic buy right now. I have about 2% of my portfolio in LUV and DAL. 

There is of course always the risk of bankruptcy or a stock dilution, hence my small position. However, long term a think it's a solid bet.your assumption that young people don't really care definitely seems out of touch. do you live in a highly impacted area? I live in one of the hot spots in the country and most people I've seen take it seriously - regardless of age.

I can't see air travel picking up until there's a vaccine.You do know Americans can't travel to Europe, Canada or Mexico now.Relatively new investor hear as well so take it for what it’s worth. In terms of sector diversification this is not a balanced portfolio at all but it all depends on your risk tolerance. 

Your entire portfolio is spread across only 12 holdings. Imagine that for some reason MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, NFLX and FB all drop 50% and do not recover(I know it sounds impossible). Your portfolio would drop by that much as well because they make up a hefty 50% of your portfolio. Of course if it went the other way you would make excellent returns. 

Are you willing to bet that these 12 holdings will outperform the market for 20 years? If so go for it, but if you think that’s a bit of wishful thinking then I would just stick to mainly a core ETF like VOO/IVV or VTI with a few individual holdings that you like or possibly a sector specific ETF for a tilt if you want that. 

For the longterm in my opinion diversification is definitely your friend. Nobody knows for certain how things will be 20 years from now. 

My portfolio is pretty simple. 

80% IVV
20% ARKW

My rationale is that 80% of my investment will be fairly safe(as safe as stocks get haha) for the long term and I’m betting 20% on higher risk holdings that could potentially generate much higher returns. I’m also aware that it could backfire but I’m willing to take the risk.Looks good to me! If it’s going up, and you keep a close eye on it then 👍🏽I like it but it is very tech heavy.  That should be fine because tech isn't going anywhere, but maybe invest in some consumer products, healthcare, etc to diversify.How much did you invest in total?Buy WM.You have a half a share of amazon? You can do that?Ørsted and Vestas have been a great ride this weekSuzlon is where the money is atGasoline was cool in the 1900s man what’s bringing it back? In my opinion,  nothing.Nah, look at last weeks golden child of vaccine. Old news is old news.It was worth it premarket to 5 minutes into the day today. You might have a good entry point down the line. It's a dividend stock.FDA Approves Dapagliflozin to Treat **Heart Failure**, Breaking New Ground in SGLT2 Competition. The FDA approved **AstraZeneca's** Farxiga (dapagliflozin) for the treatment of **heart failure** with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in adults with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D).Didn’t CHK just go BK?I would not want to hold USO. as you probably already know, CHK is being de-listed so that is unfortunate. I would add to your portfolio. If you have a long timeline, I would put some risk on. Since you did not tell us your strategy we don't know if you are focusing on growth, dividends or if you are swing trading some of these individual stocks or holding them long term. I will assume long term hold and you are looking for growth and risk. I would add the following,(only on DIPS)  CRM, FSLY, MELI, ARKW. 

If however you want less individual stocks I would add QQQ and VTI.Extremely risky. Plan on holding for a very long time.Just know that NIO and AAL are very high risk. NIO is essentially a bubble depending on the market with how TSLA is going to do and AAL has a high outward cashflow currently with a low inflow due to corona. Their earnings are on the 23rd i believe so it will move some then. AAL has the potential to double in price if things improve but if corona continues for too long it could end up in the toiletIf your friend made 22k he clearly knows more than you. How is it possible to not make any money since 2008? The market has doubled twice in that time!?!?!?!!

Real talk: Invest in S&P 500 index and don't panic sell at any time ok. That's all you have to do.In the red with most of your stocks lolIs it tesla? I bet it's teslaWhat's that 'one' stock?This thread is for portfolios, use the other pinned thread for this.NoNope, SU — Schneider ElectricsWheres the 1k shares of linux /sI like msft and aaplTo start with yes. I'm going to keep adding to it over time.I'm using Robinhood! They offer fractional shares. There are multiple other brokers that have it too like Schwab I think.I have a separate fund composed of only high paying dividend stocks that has some real estate in there.That’s a good point, kinda what I was thinking tooThank you! My only concern is that I'm very heavy into tech/IT stocks and might not be diversified enough from a pure % perspective.I wish I was doing something that intelligent... No, those %ages were calculated based on the then market value of each position divided by my total portfolio value at the time.

So, ~$1860 in MSFT, ~$1480 in AAPL, etc. out of a total portfolio value of 10kI’m in construction. I try to buy 1 or 2 shares every paycheck not of amazon of course the wife would beat me senseless. We been eating out a lot less the last couple of years. Bought amazon when it was about $1,100. I never thought it would get to where is it at now.Thanks! Yeah amzn is not moving from my portfolio. Today just went to the moon. I was thinking of selling either VGT or VOO as they are practically the same and looking at something else. Let’s see where I go.good pick but slightly overvalued, I’m waiting for their stock price to readjust before buying init seems promising, what makes it better than the  NASDAQ?I’ll expand into other industries after the economy returns to normal, but tech stocks are performing the best at the momentI also agree. Other than that, does my portfolio make sense and diversification is alright?Will do. One concern is isn't ETF too conservative in the way they kinda bundle the good stocks with bad stocks?Had zero intentions of swapping MSFT. Was definitely a long term hold for me. Should there be a reason I get rid of it?

I was thinking SMPL and OXY. Although if OXY gets back to it's former levels it will double up. I've just read articles of it being one of the potential Oil companies to go bankrupt. I have SU as well that I have a lot more faith in as a oil company.

I would like to get into BYND or NET. I'm new though. Still learning lotsKO is good but I dont thing this dude is going to make you rich.
It's a slow and steady stock that situated in a very gloe growth saturated sectorHolding until $4206.90That’s awesome that you have $200,000 in investments. I personally have a portfolio of about $58 million. I worked as a lawyer in healthcare with my own law firm for 40 years.I married a significantly younger spouse, that’s why my daughter is so young.I bought my first set of shares just under $15 and the second around $15.50 on a dip. Kind of kick myself for not buying in when my cousin told me about it when it was around $9 but oh well. Im hoping its up to $20 by next weekLol I sold my CCL for a nice profit and my portfolio looks a lot different nowLol you’re right, since I posted that comment I have been swing trading pennies and made about $1000 which is like 15% of my portfolio now I love itThe James Webb Space Telescope is planned to launch in 9-10 months.  It's been delayed several times, but once it finally works, it'll be huge.  It'll be the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope.  Plus I'm a huge fan of astronomy and have been looking forward to it for a very long time.  So part of it is a *personal* interest in the company.

If it weren't for the JWST, I'd probably have stuck solely with RTX for my aerospace/defense stock.Thanks man. I’ll rearrangeHonestly, I’m not familiar with ETFsIn my case I live in a ridiculously priced city and real estate costs are going up faster than I can save. So either my investments pay off and allow me to buy in 5 years, or they don't, and I rent forever and eventually my portfolio will be profitable.I'm eyeing more BA and looking to see if there is a nice drop in  BABA. 

Going to hold some cash to the side for any other surprises or opportunities.Honestly, it might be. But I’d hedge w apple and google just for peace of mind 😂MELI is in it's historical highest, so it may be a little bit risky this yearyeah - msft. bad habit. appreciate it,  agreed. it's super agressive at the moment. currently much more active and hands on with my investments so I hope I can properly shift into value companies, banks, or dividends when the time is right.   


right now i'm just trying to ride tech/momentum companies that I feel have legitimate potential.The problem I have with that is how overvalued some of the top holdings in those funds are, especially TSLA in ARKK.lack of growthThanks! But I believe I can’t say goodbye to investment just yet.because if you followed the virus the Chinese economy completely shut down in early January and the market began to react (slowly) but by the end of January Europe begin having an epidemic so by Valentines day the market caught up. Once we locked down the government agreed to intervene and stocks reached what most considered rock bottom so you really couldn't lose.it's called 'covid19'I’m a lawyer (Specialized in Healthcare) and had a decent salary. ($2,400,000 annually without taxes) and I worked for 37 years actively. I inherited my home without any debt connected to it. My portfolio has gone up to $56,502,781.00 as of now. So I made about 2,1 million in the last day. Kinda crazy if you think about it. I also hold some money in cash but I didn’t calculate my regular bank accounts into the posts. I usually don’t even sell stocks because I get around $600,000 in dividends annually.Would you say I should sell certain purchases?I agree shop is too overvalued but i personally usually stick to tech and renewables as a future investment.How do you know that a stock gets overvalued? Im pretty newWith the rollout of 5G, network/telecom companies are going to make a lot of money especially with the IoT connected devices climbing. I feel like ERIC has positioned themselves to play a significant part. Still looking into their financials and management, nothing drives me away yet. What dyou thinkRemember Canada's populationMaybe. Yet not me and everyone else.

But not a lot dot-commy about a luxury brand that runs half of the app market (AAPL), an advertising company that runs the other half of the app market (GOOGL), a massive low-end retailer that runs half of the cloud computing services game (AMZN), and a data mining company that owns the largest communications app in the world in WhatsApp (FB).

FB is the most dot-commy of the four. And I’d argue that GOOGL is the most underpriced at current, followed soon thereafter by fb, then APPL, then AMZN—who I see as most overpriced.

But I know of absolutely no one other than myself who’s been doing pure “big 4” for the past six years. Or two years. Most convolute their investments with equities too disparate—and are usually better off with SPY/VOO over their schizophrenic holdings.

The diversification in these four disparate competitors is substantial: it would be a mistake to think them “tech companies” and producers of simple software solutions in the vein of late-90s SaaS offerings—which never represented anywhere near the % of GDP as does the $4trn+ of market cap represented by my four primary investment vehicles.Nothing wrong with it, but I work heavily with the aforementioned four and know them in and out. “Invest in what you know.” Nothing wrong whatsoever with MSFT, but I don’t see the same growth opportunity that I see in the big 4. (Though I miss much and am often wrong : )

Oh: and I get my biz services investment fix through AAPL, even though—for the time being—MSFT does it better.What about the other two? I've been holding shop since late march, do you think it's now overbought? Bynd too? I believe it's going to be one of the most prominent companies in the decade to comeDude BYND is gonna keep running hard all year long. You'll see. I like his portfolio other than the oil.i think those are more of just chill change i’m throwing to see what works best, i mainly try to keep anything of real worth in ETFs. thank you tho! it was definitely hard to get the hang of it but i feel very stable as of now. 
edit: would you reccomend buying more ETFs monthly like i have been or waiting until big drops every once in a while.At the moment about 10%.Can't argue with that logic. I'm extremely concentrated so I may diversify  into 2-3 more stocks, preferably more stable companies with larger market caps.I have some SPCE too. They may see some good news by the end of the month mainly because of the cabin reveal and potential FAA approval. They'll be a first mover in space tourism. The big question is when they'll start flying paying customers, high growth potential.

I'd keep putting more in MSFT and QQQ. NFLX just seems inflated to me. I could sooner drop Netflix in favor of another streaming service but Office is a must have for anything professional. Cloud is a growth opportunity for both MSFT and several QQQ holdings like AMZN, GOOGL, and IBM.Ark ETFs are not available in the UK. Instead of QQQ I have these ETFs: L&G Global Tech, (which is heavy with Microsoft, Apple and Alphabet) and Scottish Mortgage Fund, which is mainly tech but has other stuff. Thanks.Ye just read an article on MarketWatch- mans was 1 million $ in debt. Risky businessThank you! Perhaps any other stock I could look into to diversify more?Thats interesting, obviously using the term tech is very broad nowadays. In my case what ive been observing is that everybody is investing in FAANG and seems pretty weird to me. How long will this last?Yeah I'd like to invest long term mostly. Investing approximatively 300-500 every month. 
But I've also planned to sell the travel related stocks as soon as I get some benefits.Haha are you Megan Fox?not very cheap lol. but im trying to buy more while DCA-ing whenever there is a huge dip like last week.I am new to this, fairly. Still lots to do. I appreciate the help. I will look into it 👍I think most of the growth stocks already had their growth, and then some, so I wouldn't be telling anyone, regardless of age to be putting $$$ into growth/tech stocks right now.  It's a great time for dividend investors.I understand the argument for using ETF’s but I prefer my portfolio to be completely allocated into stocks that I find to be reliable. For the case of XLF, I would question the exposure it would provide to the industry when over 10% is allocated to Berkshire hahaOne can avoid peril if u can carve out the losers selectively.  Gonna be hard to be long anything this week.  V shaped this is not.  More stimulus on the horizon.   Dow futures down 300 tomorrow.thanks for your opinionthanks for your opinion i think the same too about amd. If sales help growth can be massiveFed is saving the market fueling money to companies. Something like welfare to companies and free market to people.   


What small large cap exposure for example?u/Jwceltic5 what is 'small-large cap exposure' in laymen terms?Why do you believe DKNG is doomed? I could get out now with $8K profit but I believe it will be the industry standard and become a giant over the next few years. I’m in it for the long haul and my entry point is relatively low at $14.Just bought my first share of Wex! I think it’s undervalued right now and has serious growth potentialHey, thanks for your insight! I’ll definitely look into WexMy annualized is around 32% 

And I’m not benchmarking, but I know I’m beating them handily. 

And yeah, TDOC EXPLODED and I’ve had an excessive amount ever since, yet I think long term has even more promise, as they are buying up tons of competitors, as well as expanding their services. I think that there is a time and place for in person doctors, but let’s face it: when was the last time you had a pleasant experience visiting the doctors for a minor issue?

And as far as SPCE... I got in at like $6 and probably should’ve sold around $40, but still waiting for some news to spike it again. 

What others from this portfolio do you hold and why?ThisAgreed with this assessment.Bro...those are returns percentages. I have between $400-$1200 in each stock listed, minus GUSH and ETC where I'm in the $100-$200 range. Keep in mind the 15k I'm investing is all just loose money. Non essential to my life currently that's why I can freely just toss it around.

 Ford's long term, Macy's is just a gamble. 
Haha what do you mean keep searching? My current return on the 3 months has been 24% (made a little over 3k thus far). I think I'll stick to my strategy and stocks brotha.Curious as to why you feel that way? It seems tech will only become increasingly necessary and useful and profitable, especially considering current times. I don't see any reason to believe that other than "it's been going on for too long so it has to end". I feel the opposite, so I'm curious.Wow.  Years of me spewing this sentiment and you're the first person who agrees with me!  Crazy, isn't it.I hear you, I guess I’m looking at TTD, SHOP and SQ, ETSY and Doc as possible shortish types for me but I don’t know, I know diversification is important but these seems like companies that will be big winners in the next few years at least. And then AMZN to me is just a stock and company that can’t lose but I guess anything is possible. I do plan to diversify to a more balanced portfolio but I just see all these companies being huge in the short term at least. Obviously you never know though and I appreciate the feedback!You're so wrong. FB will overcome any obstacles thrown their wayI'm up already 8% since my purchase Friday. Part of my new positions.  I don't buy news, I buy dips :P  Kidding aside, most companies pulled out of all social medias for a little while to save ad money. I'm confident for now and already have a cushion to move away in worst case scenario which I'm confident won't occur.Oh I see, lol my bad I thought everyone was sharing the gainsIf I wanted to actually see growth I’d stick with docu. Fucking love that stock

Tattoo is a Hail Mary for sure. Got a bunch cause it was cheap. If it does half of what impossible burger does in the next 9 months I’m happy. Fwiw I’m sitting on a few at $17 and it hasn’t dipped below $16. I flat out don’t see it dropping more than that but the potential is still there 

So if you got some money lying around, fuck it why not. But I’m not so sure it’s a sure fire thing. I’m quite clueless to this stuff tbh. But aren’t we all lolI totally agree, as well as people potentially going back to school in a recession, Adobe is standard.Word, thank you!That’s very true. My thinking was that they will stay pretty flat until COVID vaccine. You are right, though. For the sake of diversity it might been good hang on to them.I will check into that.Ill second that..  Not sure what everybody sees in NKLA.  Maybe short it but going long I dont see it.  Other than looks great.I work  since 2016 as a trainee (in the metal industrie) and Save around 60% of my income (at the Moment 1100€ from 1500€) and my dad also saved for me since I’m little and gave me the money.Is that the net expense ratio? Here's what they are. Now you got me wondering if I should do ETFs if I'm going to have to pay a lot of fees..

SMH - 0.35%

VV - 0.04%

VOO - 0.03%

VONE - 0.08%

RTH - 0.35%

QQQ - 0.20%

XLY - 0.13%Not a lot - $300. I just graduated college and started work. Going to try to put $150 in each week from here on outgreat feedback and Thanks!

Allow me to defend Uber a bit :) - altho I definitely put Uber as a high risk investment.

I see your point about self-driving - I even think there's a very small chance some giant may buy Lyft on that side, but that's not gonna be tomorrow. For me, self driving is not gonna happen tomorrow, and probably not widely used in the next 5 (and even 10?) years, but who knows.

I see Uber (or Lyft) as something needed today/next 5 years - even with covid-19 around - and for ride haling service I don't see many competitions globally.

That's one of the fundamentals I'm following: Company has to be in the conversation for the market share. (unless there's a justified risk/reward)

Having said that, it's very unlikely I increase my position on Uber, while I can't say that for the others.DIS 100

ERI ... 36.10  (yeah I know I sux)Thanks for the feedback, I’ll look into TD and RY as wellIn March> and ETF's are a bad idea right now

How so?[deleted]I got UAL on the advice of one of my friends, don't know why he picked it though. I'll look into hotels/casinos and tech. I was thinking either Microsoft or Sony to hold until the Xbox/PS5 launches, so yeah that sounds good.I don't know why but you made my day! I hope I do well enough to thank myself in the future.Like previous guy said they won’t go bankrupt. défense contracts, space industry. It’s not an airlineThey may trail the market but they aren’t going bankrupt. Their defense contracts will see that they remain viable.

Edit: Also their recent bond offering.yeah wareen buffet said never to invest in airline companiesFriendly advice, check out QQQ. It’s a tech ETF of almost 50% holdings in FAANG. Also other great holdings like Nvidia, Intel, Cisco, Adobe, etc.I was thinking about that, hoping a rebound from Boeing to sell off half the shares for reinvestment. What do you recommend? I was looking into Gilead and maybe Pfizer. Or maybe a share of blackrock would be best.Thanks. I am not in US, so I don't have access to US ETFs but have some European/swedish ones. So far, not so lucky there, still in the red compared to pre covid, while my aggregate of the individual stocks is few percentage  points better than in Feb😉What about the proposition of cutting your losses and using what money you have left and investing it in currently growing shares.

Once there is evidence that the airline is beginning to recover, would that not be a more valid time to sell your profited shares (which you held in the interim while the airline company bottomed out) and reinvest into the airline but with a slightly recovered portfolio?I wish I would've bought more. I have a fractional share and timed it very well.Sold yesterdayYes it could.. I’m buying more tomorrow. Pence speaks at noon. I think it hits $12 tomorrow at one point. Hoping to get in before $10interesting take on UNH, which extends to CI also.  Compared to other sectors it seemed like high upside (20-30%) while a hedge against my technology-heavy positions.  

From a personal finance perspective, the best thing that happened to me was I made very little $$ my first few years out of college working in non-profit.  I shifted to a corporate job track around 25 years old but kept a similar standard of living.  I try to save 35-40% of my monthly income currently.  I was also highly fortunate to graduate without student loansFirst psychedelic pharmaceutical company to go public (OTC).  I’m hopeful they will report progress in a company update on 7/2 that bumps the stock price.  It’s mostly a speculative play in products that I hope become widely used sooner than later.Thanks for this break down. Really appreciate the input. This does seem like a genuine aspect I should consider before entering the market. I was thinking of using the above shares as a source of small profit, similar to a high interest savings accounts with a bit higher risk/return. Is this a wrong approach to have?yeah..i've been told that a few times. May just stick to VOO here on out. but what do you think of my stock picks? I just sold my SRNE, it was free from a brokerage and I didn't see any future with it. I also added +2 of DKNG, +1 RTX, and +1 MRNAso add SRNE? or sell MRNA and add SRNE? I have MRNA because I researched they're among the top 2 in the search for covid19 vaccine.Hum, they are not that good of divI see tremendous potential for SNAP, although it comes with risk. They are  popular with gen z. But will gen z continue to use SNAP? Or will they migrate like younger millennials? 

Personally, I see them being very profitable in 10 years. I’m a huge fan of their founder/CEO. He’s hungry and isn’t content with his current success. I see SNAP porting their messaging tech to another utility, diversifying by adding another social media app, and continuing to increase users on their flagship app. Who knows, maybe the AR investment will pay off in a big way. But it’s a risky investment, but unlike many other companies (TSLA, perhaps even DKNG), I don’t think the risk is priced in.What about WMT? Do you see growth potential there or do you think it will be a stable grower?lmao it’s from my savings account my parents made for me a while ago. i forget what the account is called but it builds interest every year i think and the money grows slowlyyea makes sense to hold in long term. I sold bc i didn’t think it would go higher in short term. if it falls back down to like 7 i’m buying back inyea makes sense. i’ll probably sell when i break even and buy more into nvidia or buy into SQtheir fees are very nice and high toocongrats they aim to get young'ins to buy their stock. now do you also like their high fees? (im pro tesla)yeah i kind of found it funny how there was a post of a guy with a long list with %'s and at the end saying its 3k lmfao like dude buy 1 amazon stock and go make more money XDThanks!Thanks so muchI’ll look into it!I tried with Genius and DIGGLY but they got me in a big hole so I’m staying away from thoseDo you think I should sell some of my holdings and buy more of AMZN or MSFT or just DCA over time?why google not in this discussion?Thanks.

Would that be Vanguard's S&P500 for example?Would it be suitable to put 60% of savings into ETFs and 40% into individual stocks that I like to keep up with? (A select 4/5)But is it likely they'll release another?I will eventually but I like to buy in lots for whatever reason :PThanks for the feedback! And yeah, I was looking into TSMC but it seems most of their customers (Apple, Nvidia, AMD) have higher profit margins. Also, they may have more incoming competition from Samsung, Intel, and Qualcomm which could effect margins more so. IMO for the short term, there might be serious growth, but I think it’ll even out over the next decade. Plus if their customers are in the same industry and get affected, they will too. I wanted to diversify from having nearly all tech stocks. 

Regarding exposure to non-us based markets, what’s your take on Chinese based companies?Thanks! Appreciate the feedback!Quite a lot. My grandfather bought DIS shares for my sister and me in various installments as gifts for birthdays and Christmas from 1995-1998, but the bulk was 10 shares in 1996. In all, he spent less than $500 for my 19 shares; I don't know exactly what the average cost per share is, but I estimate around $25. I wish I'd sold at $150 and bought back in at $85, but hindsight lolSolid dividend but the return just ain't worth it imoI've thought the same, but I'm just playing the long game with it. Got a divi yesterday and bought 25 more shares. Plan to just keep doing so. The return isn't outstanding, but the power of compounding can be. 

I almost see it as a savings account with a huge yield. Lol. It's only 4% ish of my portfolio and it't just apart of my "barbell" approach as they call it to a balance of value and growth. I do really think they are valued so low because of their massive debt load, but the wireless business isn't going anywhere and if they can pay that debt down over the next 5 years or so I think it could really unlock some better value. Might have 1000 shares by then. LolWhat do you mean?Next time I make profit from swing trading, net profits going straight into a s$p500 mutual fund, and some tech companies like MSFT or DIS, gotta diversify my shit ahaNot really aha 17.50 price, but it’s either a make it or break it situation, so imma hold till it’s bankrupt or back to normal (50$ish)What price did you buy in at? I’m holding some stokes. I’m waiting for it to jump up more to pre covid before I sell.Haha yeah I most certainly am!I've never heard of VEEV! I'll look into that. I value dividends very highly and google unfortunately does not fit that category :/ (same story for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix). I'm actually looking for an opportunity to split some shares from Microsoft to invest in Apple though.Yup. I'm betting on their leadership change from Ginni Rometty stepping down. I think they have recrorded 20+ quarters of declining revenues before they decided to push Arvind Krishna as the new CEO.I'm eyeing on the electric car industry as well...instead of actual cars, I invested in Albemarle (ALB) for lithium battery (they are currently the leader in this industry), but panic sold during the crash. It looks like its recovering... I also used to hold GM for their investment in EV (let's not forget Volt has been out forever) and autonomous vehicle, but after covid my thoughts are changing with cheap gas prices and potential for more people to WFH...i have a feeling that car demands might not be so high.I named this portfolio “bet big” because I put $5k in that I could lose and still be fine financially.  But, I value your point and will look at selling out of Delta for a better choice today.Why do you have UNH on that list?  Just trying to learn a bit. They have a dividend yield of 1.63% and they are almost at their 52 week high with a current price of 307.54.  

Again, not wanting to be a critic, just asking so I can learn.   I am very interested in health sector stocks that pay decent dividends. Love the picks you had for ABBV and Pfizer BTW.Appreciate it. Was looking into ABBV, think that would be a good addition.Great advice, much appreciatedThanks! Not so much, TSM is pretty solid in terms of tech, financials and operations for at least the current decade. It pays dividend, has relatively low volatility, low debt and benefits from multiple secular tailwinds, not even mentioning their basically non-existent competition and their geopolitical importance. If anything it may dip due to its central position in the trade war, in which case I'd DCA but without going too far above 15%.

I actually wanna decrease my AMZN relative exposure to 20% but without selling so I'm looking for rebalancing opportunities/suggestions lolDefinitely not long term, mabye for a few months because i think the markets will go up in that timeframeTQQQ is actually not terrible long term...  In the last 10 years it has averaged a 45% return per year.MSFTIt used to be 100% energy. I bought in a lot of cheap energy in March crash. Sold majors last week as the oil recovery will take longer and oil drilling and extraction will suffer in the coming months.

Refineries and natural gas are the only plays with depressed oil Capex and cheap oil.I agree. It's a big risk. I guess it will be surviving a bit of airbus and DoD funding. It is in a moaty position as its very hard to get all the certifications for the aerospace Industry. The balance sheet says it will hold for a while. I only have 5% of my portfolio assigned to it. When it was below 20 it was a  low hanging fruit with a very large margin of safety.Haha not yet. 30s still. I go through the least walked path at my age compared to peers in the same range. I care a lot about valuations (margin of safety) and in many tech stochs the ground is too far away from the stock price.

I compare P/B as stories in a building. I think I would be unharmed falling from 0.5 story than surviving from a 10 story building.  Sometimes it can be other metrics, depends on the industry/sector.ThanksGood point about redundancy. I didn't think about the overlap when I got the 1 ROBO. I just wanted automation in the portfolio. I'll drop it and see if I can find something that makes more sense. Maybe just buy 1 more BRKS. I bought gold because of the fed money printing.BRK, big daddy Warren is holding stacks to the ceiling, if there's a second crash he's gonna own your city. HR.UN Retail is going to come back strong. Enbridge, discounted utility/midstream great dividend. Pfizer/Intel both undervalued solid companies that are primarily export-oriented so will benefit from a devalued USD, industry diversification. XOM for direct energy exposure and gamble for riding the wave of demand back up.Awesome advice, thanks! I hold a bit of Apple in BRK but definitely sounds like a good idea to make it a bigger part of my portfolio. Wow, didn't know about TLT.From my understanding, their growth will come from the fact that more and more of newer tv models will be integrated with Roku.Yeah im holding bags in it right now. It blew up yesterday 🚀🚀🚀I have not committed to ARKW just yet but TSLA and a few other holdings are interesting to me. I was just looking into WCLD.  It has a better expense ratio than ARKW but also holds some high growth holdings so I may consider that instead with TSLA on the side. 

I do like VGT in that it has roughly 300 holdings VS QQQ’s 100 holdings but VGT is very heavy in AAPL and MSFT(35%). To be honest I was torn between choosing one or the other. They are both funds with a good overall track record thus far.Thanks for the reply! Fortunately, we can save a decent amount every month, so I’m honestly not too worried. I’m just looking to do a little better than market performance, hence the individual equities not making anymore than 6% (but primarily 4%). I already know you’re looking at Tesla and Virgin Galactic lol but they’re two companies that I’m willing to bet on the long-term vision at just 10% of the portfolio. Any advice on how you’d adjust it if you needed money in 5 years? That is when we’ll need the money based on current plans. But again we save every month, so most of any house fund is our principal. I’m not looking to make 5x returns or anything to afford a home hahaha.I’m thinking at least 3 yearsappreciate the feedback and insight. 
I have similar sentiment now with Covid second wave and I’ve pondering for the last week or so to liquidate my riskier positions... spacs, oil, airline to move to more stable plays. it would be good to hedge since I do have a large investment in AAPL (~21.5%) and add a few safer IT/bio stocks to my portfolio something like MSFT, SHOP, DOCU, MRNAThis is good advice.  After a while I just bought VYM because I realized I wasn't expert at picking individual stocks.I'm aware, I was looking to invest for the long term. Unsure if your commentary is implying advice to sell, hold?overvaluedreallocated DIS and SFET at open to equal share in BABA and NIOThanks for the advice. What do you think about PYPL?18 months of cash and a core belief that the world will forget about social distancing as soon as they're able to. Even if they make it to 80% of their 2019 average price I'll turn a nice profit - holding for hopefully no longer than a yearSteady stream of royalties, low expenses, and they own a lot of land in Texas including on the Permian Basin.

I find it a bit difficult to value though.Yup I'm looking at trimming TPL because I'm not too confident about my ability to value it. Not planning on trimming V though.

I'm not terribly worried about diversification and would actually prefer to not be too diversified, otherwise I could have just purchased an index fund.Been holding for about a month and up 50% probably going to hold until oil use rises to somewhat pre Corona pricesAll those mutual funds are based in indian/European stocks and funds. So none of the us tech stocks are in them, that’s why My individual socks are mainly ya tech stocks for the growth potential. I’m tempted to cut down visa and MasterCard a bit as they’re relatively the same and I couldn’t decide for 1 so got both and get more amazonThanks so much for the reply. Sorry I wasn’t more detailed. 

I contribute the max 401k contribution of $19.5k a year (now that I bumped up my contribution about 4
Months ago). No employer match. Comes out every payroll. It’s with the company 401k provider and has been since inception.

I have a six month emergency fund aside from the 
$30k saves. 

I will have to look into a high yield savings.

I do not have a Roth IRA.

I am looking at at least medium but more long term.

I am not comfortable with options for sure and don’t think I ever will be. I am definitely willing to learn more about ETFs and index funds. I need to teach myself more about mutual funds and bonds.Thank you for the input!I actually work at Docusign!Ending up grabbing $1K of 	ARKW. Thanks! That ETF seems promising.I live with my parents, I make my meals at home, and I drive a Prius.It has a much higher expense ration when compared to VOO or other S&P 500 funds.I'm 30, so yea I guess my speculation/tech could be growth instead (I guess isn't most growth stocks tech related anyways) 
What would you suggest for someone my ageAlso for bond ETF ishares should be fine for their 1-3 and 7-10 etfs?Thanks for the feedback! Always looking to diversify where I can! Got any recommendations for financial sector positions?Ooo I almost bought some of their stock actually! TSLA seems to have spiked the price of ARKK a little so I'm just waiting until that bubble bursts to buy in lol.Yeah, ARKK is basically ARKW and ARKG combined.I don't know I'm kinda fine with a mix of ARKs and their growth. I know they overlap, but I don't mind that. I diversify with dividend ETFs.I got it a long time ago. I will sell a couple when they are higher.Do you agree I should wait on selling VOO until it’s higher and MSFT is to high?I have a lot of penny stocks for weed section but there still penny stocks so I couldn’t post emMFA had a solid price point precovid. It is still down and still climbing. 

I have not looked back into their financials recently but I have seen return from it. Need to do some looking intoThat's what I'm looking to get into outside of just these ranked travel stocks, which I am aware they will take years to rebound I was looking to hold most shares 2 to 3 years.

I'm going to do more research on the tech companies I just haven't done enough to feel safe investing anywhere but thanks for the info DOCU looks like it was a huge gainer.You don’t think PINS will grow as they start to monetize their platform? They’re gaining followers too, I’m not expecting a few months, more like 1-2years +

Edited: thank you for replying btw!Thanks for the advice! So I just took a look at ARKK and looks like it's down 12% YTD? Am I missing something or is now a good time to buy in?Yeah i’m thinking about switching those two % wise. What etfs do you recommend that don’t carry many bad companies.I wouldn’t remove Netflix. Lower it, sure but don’t straight up remove it.Really? Cool. I was worried about my CLSK buyinRobinhoodholding % example apple is 7.8% of portfolioIt’s how much of his total money is in each stockaren't all schools lifting 'stay at home' in fall?Would definitely buy the recent dip in CheggThanks for the reply.  

In regards to the penny stocks, you are absolutely correct, in fact, I got rid of most of these stocks below $5 (penny stocks.) They require too much maintance and the risk is too high.  

Eric and Nok were bought because of 5G 😉.  Will see how these do in the next couple of months.  You combine this with the fact that Huawei is being thrown out from many countries do to security concerns, and this will only benefit these two companies.  I bought more shares today from both of these companies.  

I'm feeling iffy about Airbus to be honest.  Airbus benefitted from the A320 Neo, and the 737 Max fiasco from Boeing, but with demand slumping it might be too much of a wait for me.  

I've also invested in Cloudfare.  It's the stock that I've put the most money into.  

As far as ETFs are concerned, I have a Wealthfront account, and ETFs make a large amount of that portfolio.  The BRK stock I had is also gone, idk why I did that.  I'm considering scrapping the Wealthfront account and buying bonds and ETFs on here my self.  I have to do more research on that before I start managing all my money my self though.LVGO is at its ATH now though right?Why do you have so much faith in it?Lol not even sure what to make of thisI'd prefer under 24, but I'm also content with buying at 25. I think it can hit 30-35 this year.Just the cost, really. The platform is OK and not very user friendly, but it'll only cost me a couple bucks a month in the end. It was also recommended to me on here and from friends.Well I currently have lots of time. Although I will try to remove maybe around 5 stocks depends on what happena the next few months if I can't keep up with all the analysis needed.

Besides trimming it down, any advice for me?Why would this be satire?NopeThese are suggestions, right? Also, do elevators really have the potential to gain value anytime soon?Schwab. Also I should add that SCHB, SCHF, and SCHE are in my Roth IRA account.Thanks! This made me 500 today off the 500 I put in. Now  with these positions  [https://i.imgur.com/M4sFljl.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/M4sFljl.jpg) which do I cash out on and which do I hold? As you can see by the Ford call options I have no clue what I am doing or even write the positions I have.Thanks!! I’m going to check these out 🙌🏾I got very fortunate during a boom which may not be spoken about in this subreddit, lol.I understand that there are other stocks that probably have higher returns in the short term, but I still believe there’s room for growth for these tech giants.

Goldman Sachs just came out with a $3800 price target for Amazon.

These are definitely long-term holds for me.Wish I got in earlier. Not sure if worth it still.Call options on Wells Fargo, NIO, and AMDyes definitely set a stop-loss for TSLA. i’m not sure how long it can sustain this runThats fair, I just think they'll do everything in their power to come back, and even before I felt sports betting was undervaluedNo but i´m turning 13 within 1,5 months and then I can have a jobNah Tesla is the best Auto company you can invest inNot OP but I love it. Preferred Pentagon contractor, 40% COVID discount. Decent dividend and a pretty easy ride back up to pre-COVID levels over the next 36 months.like the comment before said there is plenty to like about the company, it is currently trading low and will gradually rise over time so its letting me add to my position while enjoying its dividend. its a long term play for me. i actually found this to be very appealing during this COVID time.

thats just my opinion hopefully it helps you out good luck .Yeah If you want dividends, you could see much better gains from MSFT and AAPL.At what price you pay for your nkla ?2021 isn’t that far away.  Musk was sued by NIkola for patent infringement on their semi truck windshield.  Nikola won.  This is why Elon is tweeting about semi trucks all of a sudden, these companies have history.  I saw an interesting take, that possibility one day the 2 companies may merge to form Nikola Tesla, but I think egos won’t let that happen.I went heavy into NIO around April for a few reasons that I believe are very important. 

1) China passed a tariff on imported (foreign) gas vehicles.
2) Regional Chinese governments bought a 20% stake in the company.
3) China is committed to green-tech and supporting a domestic electric car market (rolling out 30k plus charging station infrastructure).
4) Tencent bought an equity stake in the company
5) They actually make and sell vehicles that Chinese consumers want
6) Innovative tech - battery swapping  

State support - Check
Big Tech support - Check
Powerful and growing brand - Check
Smart CEO - Check

This is a long-term hold.Well yeah they're long term growth companiesAgreed. I love love LULU both as a brand and a stock, but 1/4 of your portfolio on a single brick and mortar chain is asking to get effed in the a.tbh i think itll be one of nikes biggest competitors in the clothing departmentYea I get that, and once this corona thing is over I won’t be, but they just seem like they got the most to gain from right now2-month investor here. I'm going to hold TSM for at least the next 3 years.

No one comes even close to TSMC's technology. [Samsung](https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-begins-mass-production-at-new-euv-manufacturing-line) has already lagged one generation behind.

I expect TSMC N7+ [EUV](https://fuse.wikichip.org/news/2788/tsmc-n7-euv-process-starts-shipping/) to be a HUGE success.Yeah I sold about half, but Maybe earnings do well.Oh yeah I'll fix the formatting, the first two lines are just all the stocks I have the rest are the ETFsThanks for your input, and I agree with you. I just need to find a good way to trim down.  I am importing what I can into excel and hope to be able to track my positions better. My hope is to see which ones pay the most dividends and which ones are in the red and start trimming from there.  Also considering just going and and setting stops on every position and let the chips fall where they may.Yeah, I am on a massive waitlist though like 1.5MM people hahathe bonus is from the government not the bank. Lisas are only available to uk residents who do not own a home and are under 40. 

The money can only be withdrawn to buy a house but that is what I am saving for. You can put up to 4000 per year into a cash Lisa and the government will put up to 1000. You can have a stocks and shares Lisa at the same time, with the same percentage bonus but with a £20000 annual investment limit.Oh I agree - I sold most of my $CAN position before an imminent drop but kept some just because I like the company. Most others, I'd say around 1/3 of my stocks as it stands now are short term plays I hope to sell by the end of the calendar year.I'm not too worried about it. Only about a quarter of my portfolio is Chinese, and of that, I would say 3% is in the at-risk pile. I don't think Alibaba or Weibo will have too much trouble with audits, but especially the former.

I'm also involved in international relations professionally with a regional focus on Chinese affairs so I'm probably more familiar than other investors.Diversification mainly,  bought it at 6.20 the other week and sold it 8 last week so it still made me profit.I'd definitely be open to suggestions for other international funds, I picked VIGI because I was familiar with a decent amount of the holdingsYou lucky mother bleeper.....stock plummeting right now haha....sold at the right time.At 24 years old, i think he can afford to be 50%+ in Tesla. Tesla is one of those stocks where the risk/reward is crazy but if you are young, i think that is one of the best to be in. The future is so bright for Tesla and its not just because of their EV's.They’re great companies. But they won’t be able to perform like growth stocks in the future..... seems like a really low risk portfolio....AAPL is mostly gadets, phone, laptop and now streaming. Microsoft mostly enterprise and cloud. So definitely not same. People should stop categorizing every company as tech. Tech is a necessity now. You should categorize based on what they sell.I love Spotify and have never used anything else for the last 3 years so I’ll certainly look into them. Thanks!Hows the other metrics? Long term debt, ROE, ROIC?Hm perhapsI would stick to the big players like MSFT or Amazon. I'm not interested in trying to predict the next big thing and do an all or nothing gamble ya know? I'm thinking the tech sector will continue to dominate and I would invest in VGT. It has the higher returns and low ER I want but also takes all the research and guesswork out of it. 

So the question is would individual stocks completely blow an index like that out of the water so much it would be stupid not to invest in it? If so I could really dig in. Or since VGT holds a ton of Microsoft, apple, visa, etc it's going to be similar growth?About 7% at the moment, pretty happy with it, considering the corona virus situation, probably could have taken advantage of it better if i knew what i was doing but i'd have definately taken 7% when i startedGreat points thank you man.Yes because tax accountants are experts in the stock market...What do you mean on the DIP? Also thanks for the tips!That's exactly what I'm worried about, because I believe the stock has much room to grow but I just thought it's overvalued right now. With current value it's market capital is the biggest in the car industry, which just doesn't make sense right now. Fingers crossed it'll drop a bit so I can pick my shares for now loss.[deleted]That's like asking why someone invested in V over JPM. AMD and TSM aren't competitors.Definitely high on my watchlist. Feels a little bit overbought right now - will probably look for a better entry price. Thanks for the suggestionI think they're pretty undervalued rn, especially with their new streaming platforms emerging. Peacock should provide a lot of value for them and help the stock price at least a little - plus as live sports return they should get a boost. I bought at $24 and I'm planning on holding for a few more months at least but would sell if it pops to the $40 range.Thanks for the feedback! I like all those companies you mentioned. Thinking of swapping V for SQ, and adding some TTD & TWLO. 

You recommend taking a smaller position on MSFT?But they’re like the crocodiles, they gonna be around for another 20+ yearsDefinitely gonna adjust to more diversity again but it is what it is at the moment lol.I’m a long term investor. I did my DD on most, I bought some before I knew what I was doing. I do use the Macd and RSI indicators to determine if they are a buy. I read so much stock news. So I think I am ok. I take the emotions out of trading by setting limit sells and buys. I only change those if the news changes.CheaperThere’re much better opportunities than MSFT. It’s a mature company that will perform well, for sure. But it’s  not going to 5x in the next 10 years unlike many other smaller companies out there. MSFT is very low risk for a long term investing horizon.Exactly my thoughts, and with the drop MCD had like a week ago I thought it'd be a great investment. I've been eyeing SBUX for a while too, might buy at some pointBeginning of the pandemic and everything was closed. I did lots of shopping and home building so I bought in.Now was it a smart decision... eh I could have invested elsewhere 3 months ago and saw much more return so..I’m confused at the double parentheses?I often think anecdotal stuff can be the most helpful. Real-life example as opposed to an online speculationCouple reasons why Visa has been doing alright.  
\- Fewer cash payments due to an increase in online shopping.  
\- Stimulus checks and increased unemployment benefits (which are due to run out soon though)They’re certainly overvalued, but I believe in all of the businesses I have my money in and think there’s more growth. I anticipate them going down during the next crash, but that’s when I’ll add to my positions. I’m a long term investor and looking to hold my positions for a whileI was late too. Got my original shares at $22, but wanted to get in when it IPO’d. I was a week or so late, but once gambling is legalized nationally (inevitable and sped up due to covid) it’s going to steadily increase. I’m in NJ and their app, offerings and customer service is far and away the best gambling platform there isI was going to say the same thing. Most of his individual holdings are already in QQQ. FANGAM should do well but adding this with QQQ is not diversification.He’s holding it for a long time. Rather than trusting a single bank, he is profiting off of the growth of banks overallTicker?[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-26/norwegian-air-hits-record-market-value-in-logic-defying-rally](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-26/norwegian-air-hits-record-market-value-in-logic-defying-rally)

After the restructuring the stock has been heavily diluted. The current market cap is at 9 billion NOK, which is more than before the crisis..?  Or am i missing something..Aren’t a lot of these pharmaceutical companies pursuing coronavirus vaccines a bit inflated at the moment? Is this a risky long term hold?I was thinking about buying Disney the next dip. Visa and Walmart are great ideas, I’ll look into them. Thanks a bunch!BOTZ is an ETF. Do you mean an ETF that’s closely linked to the market? Because I was thinking about picking up some SDY.I use schwab. My dad set up a custodial taxable account for me when I was like 13 (started with 4 shares of apple lol) and just recently we set up a custodial Roth IRA since i have income now.>fxaix/spy

Disney is well diverse like Apple with media. They can still use their streaming services to hold onto their worth during this downturn.A lot of people talk about ARKK. Looking at their top 10, totally seem spec and a lot of its success is attributed to TSLA. QQQ seems a bit more stable for my likingThank you :)Care to elaborate. I thought Tesla wasn't either when it was trading at $150 and now its $1000.It will definitely bounce back. Boeing relies heavily on them. The 737 Max is the problem. Once we get past COVID-19 or have a vaccine — and the 737 Max issues are resolved with the FAA (software is already fixed), things will be up up up for Spirit.It is not a budget airline. They design and manufacture aerostructure — with Boeing. Boeing and Spirit Aerosystems build commercial and defense planes together.I forgot to mention...I bought 1000 shares of Wayfair   @ 25.19 in March and recently sold it @ 175.48. One of the best moves I’ve made to date, in the stock market. Wish I had held on a little longer, but being greedy can cause many problems!I’ve had it since it was $71 and now it’s like $48, I don’t wanna sell it now and take my loss because I’m pretty much banking on a rebound so I can get some of my losses back.Hey man;

Thanks for your in depth reply. I actually really love your portfolioLol.... bruhYeah you can own fractional shares in some companies. I invest trough Robinhood.Appreciate your opinion.Medium term it might be fine, but with my money yeah I'm just staying away from oil.YesI guess so but my thinking is if COVID dies down, I believe every single one of these stocks will come up. I have a strong conviction that COVID will be dead before the new year. But even if COVID continues, I don't see these stocks dipping much further than when I bought (around the Mar-May dip).

To add to that - I don't believe COVID has wiped out between half and three quarters of the value of each of these companies.Thanks for real advice! I did my DD after purchasing AAL and I think I'll get out while I can.Because I panic sold back in 2008 and have only dabbled a handful of times by putting money in and not being patient, eventually losing money. S&P 500 index like VOO?Yeah... I could use some guidance lolIts a bag holding stock isnt it?Ahhh okay. This is a great portfolio! My recommendations would be to trim a position or two (probably one of your many semis) so that you're able to track all of them without quitting your full-time job. I also do not see any REITs or consumer Staples, which might be a good idea to add more diversification. REITs are typically have low correlation with the rest of the market, helping to decrease risk in downturns. Consumer Staples can also help to decrease your risk. Growth is good when you're young but as you get older, you will want to have more conservative bets! Just my opinion :)Diversification recommended. Leaving your fate to one sector and two companies is a bad long term play.How
Many different companies was that? 70? Also I’ve been using Robinhood, I have maybe 22 stocks and I keep wondering to myself how many different individual stocks can I own? Do you know the answer to that?I did something very similar.Would you suggest Robinhood to build your own portfolio like this for a super beginner or something like Stash which has some fun ETFs and automatically recurring investments?I have an IT background, and I see these companies in  totally different sectors, so it is diversified in a way.

For instance MSFT is a big cloud player while APPL is more on the consumer side. Both NVIDIA and Qualcomm are semiconductor companies but their audiences are different. So if mobile market slows down maybe bad for Qualcomm and Apple, but there is Sony, Nvidia, and others for home computing. For this portfolio to go down completely there needs to be a global recession or some other catastrophic event IMO where electronics become irrelevant.This is a valid assessment, and you might miss out on the benefit of a recovering retail and travel landscape. I might mix in a few ETFs in other industries (banking/energy/retail/industrial/biotech - NOT travel), but not more than 15% of your portfolio. And I wouldn't sell any of these current positions, just expand your portfolio little by little.Jeez. I'm 46, and just started investing. I'm happy for you bro. I guess if I save $6k I'd take the risk and buy 2 Amazon shares for the long term.AMZN over 2900 today! Just crazy.

And yeah I'd probably combine those. VOO has been very kind to me so I'd probably go that route but there's so many etfs out there it can be hard to choose.not sure what you mean by better than nasdaq.  


only suggested it as a hedge against your holdings. you're currently tech heavy  (im assuming this was your strategy all along)  so QQQ could help broaden your diversification into the other tech companies and give you some balance. Also serve as a hedge - if tech continues to grow but into other companies other than the top tier ones, QQQ might be able to bring in some of those gains for you.QQQ it's just a professional selection over Nasdaq, but Nasdaq can be a good choice tooNet is goldenGet rid of OXYWell damn.Impressive! I'll speak for everyone and thank you for being a member here. I'm sure you have learned so much from your experience and success. 

Any thoughts on the current health situation? Surely there will be some big losers and huge winners in the Healthcare industries coming post virus. Anything you're willing to share is greatly appreciated.For your sake I hope it’s up. But for me I want it to drop so I can buy some.Got it. I own all three in about equal proportions, I was just curious about your take on it. My best guess is that LMT will be the best performer over 5-10 years due to the F-35, but I own all three because I don’t see the US government cutting defense spending significantly, no matter who wins in 2020It's like a basket of stocks that gets traded based on what it holds. You will have to pay and additional fee to hold it. But it has good diversification inside a theme they are aiming for.It’s a big gamble but as long as you’re comfortable with the risk, I wish you the best of luck. Particularly since we have 10 investments in common lol.Yes, it is, I agree. I would prefer for it to pull back to the 50 DMA. If I was to move into it today, I would size in very slowly and on a DIP, because it is extended which increases the risk. So, since we don't know if it will keep going or correct, sizing in slowly would get you in the stock without risking too much capital. Also, in my suggestion above I said to nibble it, once again because it is extended.The ARK ETFs are not diversified enough to compare with QQQ. Lots of high risk growth stocks. It's also an actively managed fund unlike QQQ. I can't argue with it's great returns in the last couple years.Don't say goodbye to it. Watch it grow while eating tapas in Spain or an Omakase in Japan. Or whatever tickles your fancy. You've worked hard to get here. Time to enjoy it. I'm on these subs daily so one day I can share a portfolio like yours lolYes that’s partly how I did it. I realized the economy would crash and pulled out. Then after the Fed did the Repo in March I reinvested it all.A quick Google search says the average income of a “healthcare lawyer” is 200k. How do you manage a salary over 10x that, especially for 37 years? Not being a dick, just curious.You just know. Take NKLA for example. They have nothing, but their stock price is quite high. If you want to be more technical then you could check price to earnings ratio.You referring to the real estate investments?Hold on to BYND. You've got it right.BYND and SHOP are two of your best holdings, especially if you bought in late March. Good grief. Keep them!SPY did 30%, So you are in the bad shape.  
But to be honest, your portfolio will provide you with negative return in the next 2 years.Saw that article too! But as long as you don’t take out a loan for $16,000 you should be goodI suggest diversifying with different sectors to your list. As of now, it is too IT heavy. Amazon, baba, shopify, apple, amd, msft, uber, norton, these are all largely IT companies (although of course all different in subgroups). It's definitely not a bad thing, IT is clearly number one sector of our generation. However, one sector does not flourish forever as history tells, and it is necessary to do some risk management by diversifying. I think you could easily do this by just increasing your ETF's, or if you know some good stable stocks in maybe Industrial (MMM/WM/HON...etc)/Healthcare (JNJ/MRK/ABBV/PFE...etc)/Cosumer Staples sectors (KO/PEP/etc....), picking out one or two from them would be nice. I personally don't think finance and REITs sector will be good for next few years so personally won't recommend but up to you! Hope this helps :)I can beYa if you're 50. They are growth stocks for a reason. Salesforce for instance will give a much better return that a dividend stocks. And btw dividend stocks are terrible right now. A lot of companies are cutting and suspending dividends left and right.Definitely understand! I do have hopes for Berkshire in the very long run. I mean look at the price for A haha. I have a very very small portion of what I like to call fun money where I throw into whatever I think is the next big thing. I’m going to go heavy when I can get Draft Kings for a decent price for sports to return to!Not sure how buying corporate bonds necessarily helps CAT or X but I see what you’re saying.

Companies smaller than ~50 billion.Small to large market cap. Roughly 1 billion to 50 billion.That dude is wrong DKNG will continue to run. I'm heavy in to sports betting as well. Check out GAN it may be a safer play than DKNG if you don't want that risk. GAN is the backend software developer for online sportsbooks and has the necessary patents to force any offline casino who wants to build an online presence to use their software. They IPO'd about a month ago and have deals with MGM, Penn, Windstar and many others.

The main risk I see with GAN is their contract with FanDuel makes up about half of  their revenue. If FD backs out, which they did last year but let the backout expire, GAN could take a hit for a couple months. I still strongly believe in the long term outlook tho.I'm a broken record on this but I strongly recommend benchmarking if you can. You are clearly beating the market now but what if your returns slow down? Would you want to know if you're trailing the market over an extended timeframe? It could only be a few percentage points which may be hard to see with the naked eye.

Yeah, TDOC is one of my favorite positions. I made my entry  in May 2017 and added shares two more times in 2017. It went from a small position to my 3rd largest position at just over 5%. I like my current doctor and the staff is great but I agree, I've had some dumpster fires over the past few years lol.

I hold TDOC, SQ, V, LVGO, ATVI, MTCH, and AAPL. (I counted DOCU before but it's still on my watchlist actually). I didn't have a trade journal when I entered those but most have a pretty basic reason for me getting in. AAPL (2016 entry) is just a powerhouse and even with a gradual decline in iPhone sales,  the services side has a lot of upside and their cash position makes them almost bulletproof. ATVI (2017) is just my play on video games. I liked them more than EA or TTWO. SQ (2017) and V (2017) were my plays on the war on cash. I just like V as a company more than MA but MA is on my watchlist. Similarly, I chose SQ or PYPL for no major reason. Just like SQ more. LVGO (Jan 2020) is my most recent entry and man, did I get lucky with my timing lol. I did just buy more shares a couple days ago. Even at ATH, with a market cap of <7B, this company has so much room to run. MTCH (2019) was my play on the dating scene. i liked the fundamentals and the future of dating will continue to be mobile-first.I was trying to give honest advice since I thought that’s what this thread is about. I wasn’t attempting to insult you. 

And I just kind of glanced through, should have realized the percentages didn’t add up.

Since you mentioned it though, I’m up a much higher percentage than that over 3 months. I’m glad you’re up though.

I’ll move onto someone actually interested in feedback.The return on tech stocks has significantly out paced the earnings growth of the sector. I think there's a bunch of positive speculation on tech stocks bc of the sentiment you say above which has inflated the tech industry's returns.

If you watch the tech industry's returns, from 2010-2016 and 2016-2020 it's basically two upward lines. However from 2016-2017, the slope of this line changes significantly, and I argue this is not coincidently when Trump was elected to office and cut cooperate taxes from 35% to 21%. Growth stocks like AAPL, MSFT, and AMZN have benefited from a historically low tax environment. If you're investing in information technology you should ask yourself - do you think Trump will win re-election?AMZN depends.  It has gone down $100 or $150 before every earnings call, so be aware of that.  I also remember it correcting hard in late 2018 (though it did rebound).  So even though everyone loves Amazon, corrections are possible.Many people have moved away from Facebook. I get they own Oculus, have the new Facetime in your room sort of thing (can’t remember the name of it), and other products and money spread out, but Facebook is their main product/service in my opinion. Younger people don’t use it much anymore, many people know about Cambridge Analytica and what happened there with the 2016 election in the US and Brexit, Zuckerburg’s a coward for not standing and Trump, etc. I think there are much more valuable services and Facebook will lose its touch (as it already has some) a lot in the next few years. Just my opinion though, I think it’s a decent stock as of right now. These are strictly opinions not based on the stock and how well it does/if you can make good money off it, but just how I see the company as a wholeno problems, I'm jealous of your SHOP though. haha I missed the boat when I had plenty of money for it. Might jump this morning even if I'm late.made a post about ams ag might look into it

&#x200B;

also lenzing as an austrian  is pretty undervalued if you ask meThere are fees associated with ETFs, but you do not pay them out of pocket--they're taken out of the share price.  Anything below about .45 is considered good, obviously the lower the better.  They do add up, but you only really need to worry about them if you have a significant amount in stocks.It still has room to grow, and DIS @100 is a good priceThe market is bound for a crash that long term investments like ETF's won't survive. I pulled out all of my long term investments before COVID really hit.Definitely. I would keep the travel stocks to <20% and mix in PG/JNJ/LMT along with your VTI/O/KO. You have some great picks otherwise.I’ve been letting RCL go as it spikes here and there and buying long term investments that are still hurtOr you could get into AMD, they're supplying the processors for both PS5 and the Xbox.No they won’t go bankrupt, however their share price will go down a considerable amount due to cancellations in aircraft orders as well as aircraft orders not being put through by big airlines until the demand is exceeding that of pre-pandemic. I agree that they won’t go bankrupt, however I think their share price will only go down for at least the next 3-4 years before coming back up when the airline industry has recovered.Thank you! Will look into it this weekend. Check out VRTX for healthcare. They're my pick for that sectorWould you put another $500 down on it if you could?I think with how low interest rates are right now and how low the fed has projected them to be in the next one to two years, putting a portion of your savings in the market makes sense. I would argue this approach only makes sense in a broad market index - like VOO you mentioned earlier. 

Individual stocks are volatile and there is no evidence to support an average retail investor can project the future returns of any single company. You hear stories about people who double their money on AAPL or AMZN but you rarely hear about the people who lose all their money. An important property of a broad market index like the sp500 is that it represents approximately the average of all returns on the market. So when you invest in VOO you don't match the highest return available in the market but you avoid the worst possible return. If you go the other route and invest in a single stock, I argue there's no way for you to know which investor you'll end up as in terms of returns relative to the market. A interesting fact I a friend told me once was 2 out of evert 5 portfolio managers beat the market in one year. Only one of those two will beat the market two years in a row. If you invest in single stocks and try to beat the market, then you are no different than these professional portfolio managers (who frankly have more information than you). If you want this investment to last 3-5 years, there's a low chance you'll beat VOO.

If you want to treat this investment like a savings account, I strongly recommend putting the money in a broad market index tracking the sp 500.I like the tech, can't go wrong with those guys.  Disney  is a good long term hold and I think RTX should be too, I also own MSFT, DIS, and RTX.  Can't really speak on the others, I have no idea honestly.Read up on SRNEI would keep moderna due to their potential vaccine for COVID, but SRNE should be a good long term hold with multiple analysts saying 100% buy and potential to reach 24$ by the end of the year.It has a very large base! So growth isn't easy.. Their online presence will increase esp. with partnership from SHOP etcDude this thinking is a loss. Could be months before break even and meanwhile that same money could be earning elsewhere every day.When I said be aggressive and don't diversify, I didn't mean just invest in one stock.  For example, I'm in the process of starting a separate brokerage account for my daughter's savings.  She'll have $1300 to start.  With this account, I plan on going long on everything, so I'm just buying and holding.  I plan on the following:

1 share of each of these indexes:
VOO $295 (500 holdings)
QQQ $260 (100 holdings)
XLG $248 (50 holdings)
DIA $267 (30 holdings)

1 share of Disney DIS $120

Then fractional shares of:
MSFT $30
GOOGL $20
AMZN $20
AAPL $20
BRK-B $20

So, in my example, the most diverse is VOO, but then I put more weight on certain holdings by purchasing the other indexes which are less and less diverse.  Then I purchase fractional shares of some top stocks, which obviously is the least diverse.  The share of DIS is in there because I'm saving for a child (and it's a good long hold.)  

As I add more money into this, I'll add more into the indexes I already have, add in some more diversity with ETFs (incl. VT, VTI, SCHH, VO, VBK, etc.), and continue adding fractional shares to specific stocks.I would just add.to the other positionsI was only commenting on what he hadDoes Apple need to release a streaming device?  
Seems most of AppleTV is software.  
If it becomes a gaming device…I have Air Canada at $17.66 so not too bad but unfortunately price was decreasing since there is a talk about second wave of COVID 19If you are eyeing EVs why not Tesla they are and will be the leader for many yearsVery true but in the future I feel like it will go up that’s just my opinionAlso ty for the recommendation on the lithium batteriesSo hard to tell, but I've also heard the opposite. Lots of investors going with JETS stock in anticipation for bounce back due to lots of panic sales of Airline stock. And JETS wouldn't be as risky as individual Airline stocks.UNH just added in there as a potential option of healthcare giants. However, these stocks have potential to continue to grow 10 years out. People feared that Apple would drop when it hit new high at 200 dollars. I feared myself, and we know what happened after...It continued to grow and it's now at 300 dollars.. missed opportunity there :/. In terms of UNH specifically, life expectancy continues to grow and needs for meds/health insurance will continue to grow. I personally don't own UNH though...I'm instead in Pfizer and Johnson n Johnson.Thats fax but if theres ever a huge pull back/correction decay’s gonna kill you. Leverages aren’t meant for long term.Nice! I’m late to the game but still considering it right now. I have Boeing too, so a little hesitant to double down. But I think it’ll be good in a year or two. Sometimes I wonder if I’m just better off putting more money into Apple though haha.I like you're thinking, however tech stocks "book value" is essentially irrelevant since it's mostly comprised of intellectual property (not much physical "stuff" to sell). I typically evaluate tech stocks based on the PEG ratio (Price to Earnings Growth). Generally, here's how I look at the PEG ratio to evaluate stocks 
<1 Undervalued
1-2 Prices about right
2-3 A bit spendy
4+ Hard pass for meWhere's the innovation and growth? All these boys are last decades stocks. Oil is dead long term. Intel basically giving up competing with AMD. Daddy warren aint gonna be around in ten years and is too shook to make moves, and got cucked by the fed. PFE peaked in 1999, like a viagra pill worn off. And physical retail less profitable every year.You should be good with Nvidia then. NEM  is a good choice too. But it is commodity and depends on lot of macro economic conditions to keep rising.Well, you aight to hold if you're down on share price, and valuatrbeach company using your favorite three metrics, look at management,stable ten year history, and profit margin “moats”.


You have to hold else you lose money; if you hold, the only way to lose long-holding is to sell short, or chapter 11.  So hold if you’re experiencein losses.


Likewise, and more important than my advice is this question: what’s your goal?  What’s your risk limit?I would never buy this companies in the first place.   
What you have to ask yourself what is your strategy?

How do you choose companies for buying?It is a good company and a sticky product. Used to own it. Sold it at highs of Feb. Planning to get back in after some correction. (Do your own research before buying)Interesting, thanksUCO looks appealing to me but how long do you plan to hold? With COVID numbers rising, more states putting further travel restrictions in place and there being so much oil in reserve it could be a couple of years before oil gets back to 80-90 dollars a barrel. 

Looking online I also saw this about UCO “UCO is designed for a one-day holding period; it’s not appropriate for buy-and-hold investors.” What do you take away from that? I really do love the idea of getting this ETF at such a low price since it has sooo much growth potential when things return to normal though.

Also, I’m new to investing and own no ETFs so I’m trying to do my DD and learn about them. It seems that this leveraged ETF shouldn’t be held for long periods of time but it sounds like that might what you’re doing and I want to understand where my misunderstanding is.Gotcha! Sounds like you're in a good spot. 

I'd look into ETFs and Index funds through Vanguard, Schwab or Fidelity. They have the lowest expense ratios. ETFs/Index funds are great because they're a bunch of companeis in one fund which decreases the risk since it's spread across a bunch of companies. You can find all sorts of ETFs too. One that focuses on specific sectors or funds that are balanced across multiple sectors. A lot of mutual funds have minimums and higher expense ratios because they're actively managed by someone. 

There are the ETFs I have right now: QQQ, VDC, VXUS, VTI, VYM ICLN

If you do invest in options, make sure you do your research. I'd recommend reading the investor relations material on the company site and news about the company. 

I catch a lot of interesting comments on this thread and it doesn't seem like a lot people read the investor relations material. It gives you great insight into the direction the company is going. The info level-sets you a bit because there's a lot of hype on this subreddit.nice. I never thought docusign would go public. you're lucky to get stock options from docusign.niceNeither of those things make you money, they just make you look poor. Answer the question!If you are 30, I think your portfolio is rather too well balanced. You could tilt towards smaller cap SaaS names like SHOP, TTD, SQ or CRWD. I am bit split on dividend. On one side the principal may not appreciate and divide t returns are low. On the other side the income stream is steady. You take the call :)JPM. Not many companies have 35 bil in profit at that valuation.Should add some QQQ as wellYou can't lose by just holding it. Maybe you should make for yourself a a buy and hold account and a separate smaller trading account. Do you just want to rebalance this every quarter or what? Great that you're getting in the game so young. What got you into stocks, parents or just reading?I personally think MSFT will out-pace VOO overall market, but I could be wrong. So I'd just sell some of the VOO and put into MSFT just a couple more. MSFT is a boss.I’m not sure what chart you’re looking at — ARKK is up 66.xx% in the past year, and up 55.xx% since Jan 1.VOO is a great ETF to keep investing in :)ARKKNo not at allSorry I should have said college schoolsNope, ATH is 115, it’s sitting at 104.5 right now.Some investors have said it could go up to 200 300 a share. And they have almost zero competition. Some have gone to say it could be the amazon of healthcare.I’ll probably buy more just to average it in. I like GAN a lot.There's a monthly fee?No advice... really. I had a 15 stock portfolio when I wasn't working... dropped it down to 5 when I started working, now I have 2 stocks and absolute conviction in my picks.

I sleep better at night this way.You have GEVO as a medium term medium risk stock, even though it’s worth 59¢, has a massive downtrend, and has an extremely low market cap. HTZ also looks very close to bankruptcy and has had a horrible downslope over the past few years. The government is going to bailout the airline companies, but they will be hard-pressed to help the non-essential car rental companies.I’m not an expert at all btwWow hahah congrats!! I did mean buy shares of them, not options, but I guess it worked out for you. First off, you probably shouldn’t take advice from me because I don’t really know that much compared to some people. I get the feeling though that Ford is a pretty weak company right now, so I’d probably get rid of those. Also, tech earnings are coming up this week, which means you may want to consider taking profits or selling your Apple, QQQ, Twitter, and VGT. I would predict that after earnings there will be an IV crush, so the value of these options has a good chance of going down (unless these companies do really well for earnings, but take a look at netflix after ER). Take that with a grain of salt :).Did you pay off your student loans yet?There is definitely room for growth, but you specifically said you want to reach financial freedom as soon as possible. Per that goal, there are more ambitious stocks to be had is all I'm saying. 
  
I think those are both great stocks, but they are not ideal for what you say you are looking to do.Buy fast today before Q2 earnings release at closing bell. Tsla to the moon 🚀can you explain what a call option is in laymen terms?Well I know that but a cheap investment could
Be thatSo you are saying just get rid of coca cola all together?Picked mine up at $56.56 the day of the spike, sold for $90 flat as soon as market openedI didn’t know that, I’ll look into it a bit more. Thanks for bringing it to my attention homie 👌How do you feel about NIO current price?I learned this a long time ago, you never let your love for one single brand dominate your portfolio. Remember, its all just a big numbers game. If you're diligent, patient, and methodical you'll have success. Maybe even get lucky a few times ;-)Wow, this is actually a really functional concept. Anything like Lisa's in the US? I know we have 102b's, is that our comp?my man!well if ur familiar with the holdings, then don't listen to me hhaha

i'm new myselfWhat makes you say that?Woulda made some serious cash if you dipped big in plug earlier this week 😁Because of your choices, I think your portfolio actually will lag the performance of NASDAQ index and possibly provide you with negative or almost flat returns in the next couples of years.

1. Because stocks market are overvaluated right now.
2. The biggest companies in the market will underperform the stocks indexes.For how long?Not bad, but it could be better.Lol I am an auditor at EY and people act as if I should be on par with Goldman Sachs traders sometimes.buy the DIP means to wait for it to move down a little, then buy. Most things are a little overbought at this time.good luck buddy.I will get into the semiconductor space as well it's hard to choose .. I found smaller.comoanies but tsm has so much market space.. have you looked at AMKOR or ASXWhen it comes to choosing a stock over another they are essentially competing yes or no ? Both in semiconductors so I wanted to see if he saw financials or technicals that made him feel like amd is going to bring him more.momey than getting tsmNope.. I would hold / add on dips MSFTWhy not go for some retailers where you might not lose out on principal amount and still keep stable dividends.. Btw wells fargo WFC is attractive for long term.Do you think Apple is in the same thinking here?You can see my results in my personal page,   


And I'm thinking, regarding your portfolio, you will get negative returns in the next couple of years.

You have to learn more.Nothing wrong with that plan, I'm holding 60% stocks myself. I just wanted to load up some cash for companies like NVDA, TSLA, SEDG, etc. which I really want, but probably would only buy if they drop hard. 

Didn't really want to sell my AMD shares, but they're very overvalued and if I had to choose between them and MSFT, LVGO, NET, RTX, OCFT, etc. to make some room, my choice is made.I don’t know anything about sports betting but my friends do and they all say it’s the best platform.  I def see it going up long term. My first buy was at $42 and today I bought another 100 to avg out at $37. Plus sold a few covered calls so around $35 avg price nowMy thinking is that you would hold QQQ and tech stocks individually because you want more of your portfolio in a certain stock AND you want the diversification of an ETF.  Let's say his whole portfolio is 100K. Yeah, he's investing about 14,380 in QQQ but within that ETF, he's holding $1,662 in MSFT. Adding 6.85%, or in this scenario, $6,850 to MSFT is not a bad strategy. It just depends on what you are bullish about. I have this strategy in place as well.NAS.OLIt's going to tank. It's purposefully riding the coattails of Tesla, exploiting the FOMO investors who felt they missed the bandwagon TSLA but the reality is that there is no there, there. There's no product and they're already walking back on their initial promises. Maybe they turn themselves around in a year but as it stands Tesla is Universal Studios and Nikola is Asylum Films.Tesla actually had a product to sellNot wanting to take a loss or wanting to recover losses is a really bad reason to hold onto shares in a company. It's not like you sound bullish on the company. It sounds like you'll be selling at $71. The primary question you should be asking is "is there something better I can invest in?" Who cares if XOM gets back to $71 in the next year. Maybe you could have put the money instead into TSLA or DIS or BABA or a new position that ends up returning better than XOM does from here on out. Then you didn't make your losses back in XOM but instead missed out on better gains.Thats what I'm doing with aurora cannibis ACB, there at  $12.31 and I payed $13.44 have 1,067 shares, really hope they bounce back buncha people are smoking with this pandemic. Just got a new ceo though hope he changes shit for the better.😅The broker I use doesn't do that brahRight on! I'll look into that, thanksthey may, But in order to conduct contrinuity of business, many of these companies may choose to raise capital through the issuance of equity (new shares). Your stake would then suffer from dilution.

This is one of the primary ways investors are gonna get screwed on some\* of these riskier companies. Just thought I'd throw it out there because all anybody ever talks about is bankruptcyIf you are looking for another airline to look at which has a high ROI potentially I saw suggestions of DAL as they have cut costs to minimal levels and have enough liquid cash to sustain for quite awhile. Although, I would wait a few days as the last time I looked they were currently on a downward trend after the spike from the news of positive vaccine results for covid. If business returns to normal they also have the potential to double in priceIt's 84. And that's after moving a couple to a purely dividend fund. I'm not really sure that there is a limit on owning individual stocks.In the end they both do the same job really so it's really up to you. I just like the UI on Robinhood. I don't use it for charts though.Also know that that's  not exactly going to happen 
Qualcomm makes chips for 5G 
Nvidia makes processors for Tesla Semi autonomous driving carsAppreciate the insight, my friend! Happy investing!Excellent advice! Much appreciated! 

The next stocks on my radar are Nike (**NKE**), Mastercard (**MA**), Home Depot (**HD**), and Costco (**COST**) along with increasing my positions in my top performing stocks such as Microsoft (**MSFT**), Apple (**AAPL**), Netflix (**NFLX**), and Salesforce (**CRM**).

I'll have to do some more research into ETFs. Any recommendations?Thanks. Yeah I don’t think amazon is going anywhere. MSFT is also a good bet for the long term. Good luck!Lol yeah well im actually ok if it goes down because I'd love to buy about 40 more shares around $13. I dont know if we'll see it that low thoughI agree. Instead of NOC I own GD for better value.Thanks! I’ll look into that.Oh I'm not OP lol. I do have similar investments though.

And I am ok renting forever. I love my city and if I can't ever afford to buy here so be it. I do want my money to be doing something other than losing money in a cash account though. Whether that's in the market or in a house, only time will tell.That’s such a nice reply! Thank you very much ❤️I get it. So what would typically be a good P/E ratio?which spy😂😂 get it. 👏🏻Just messaged you!Thanks broI appreciate the advice, and I’ll start looking into doing it. And sounds like you have a pretty good handle on things.I appreciate your well reasoned response. I think the risk is certainly there due to some of
The reasons you mentioned but also expect tech will include some of the best performing companies over the next decade.Will have a look tonight :), always looking for the next good companyyayyy <3 thanks for encouragement :)))
my best is TDOC for long term :)If ETF won't survive none of your stocks will, sorry for the bad news.[deleted]Thanks, I’ll check them out!Bought 1000 initially and 200 more today.  There’s many other things I’d like to do with $500, and at the end of the day it still feels pretty gambly (yolo I suppose!).  I have a long time horizon and truly believe psychedelics should be used therapeutically.what do you recommend i do with my WFC investment then? just hold for now?**I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**

The stock is still beaten down significantly, but thats my impression, I might be wrong. So proceed at your own risk.I agree. I will try to come up for a screener for tech. I agree I am underexposed and will increase gradually my exposureAll good points. Oil still has a good 20 years to go given the rate of electric car infrastructure being built.

The account I just opened and listed my initial portfolio numbers about was Fidelity. I guess by not having Roth I skipped a few steps lol. I am going to look into that now. My company 401k is with Voya. Should I/could I transfer that into Fidelity? Should I look to open a Roth with them as well? I did buy one share of QQQ today. Thanks for the notice on the others. I do understand how some of the ETFs have different investments to spread out the capital. I did notice that most of the Fidelity mutual funds have a $1k minimum investment. Maybe I will look into those in the near future. Thanks again for your input.I make $65,000 a year working for a tech company in San Francisco.

$20/month if your account is under $2000 for inactivity. 
$10/month for accounts over $2000 for inactivity. 

You can avoid the fee by paying commission from your accounts. Meaning, if you had $2100 in your account, you could avoid the $20 fee by trading enough stocks to generate $20 in commission. That's my understand anyway.Also...
https://www.investopedia.com/interactive-brokers-review-4587904Do you mind if we ask what are your conviction picks?All true but here is my thinking and maybe I am wrong about a few things here so let me know what you think. Currently everyone is pouring money into EVs but eventually when they become more prevalent in the consumer space investors will realize that we dont currently have the infrastructure in terms of electric capability for everyone to charge an electric vehicle at home so alternative fuel sources and ones that can help us in the short term until we can build up that infrastructure will bump. In addition, until the main OEMs convert to EVs they will increasingly become harder pressed to find ways to improve upon ICEs to reduce emissions as government regulation tightens. This will be especially true if Biden is elected in November. Also, yes HTZ is incredibly risky which is why i limited the overall investment and labeled it as high risk. If things improve, the rebound and ROI could be massive but the downside is I lose a small investmentDidn’t go to post-secondary (yet).What do you suggest?Tough for me to give a high level explanation but I’ll give it a shot.

They’re contracts that give me the right to buy 100 shares of NIO, AMD, and WFC at the agreed upon strike price on the the expiration date. Im making the assumption that months from now, the stocks i want to buy, will be more expensive than the strike price I agreed upon. 

*I would never suggest doing any type of options trading until you understand what they are.*I would look into using M1 Finance they offer fractional shares so you can buy any stock as long you have $10I don't want to recommend. Just giving you facts. Coca cola is good for dividends. I think it is more suitable when you look for steady income every quarter or so. Given that you are young you can take some risk as you have good years to recover any small losses. Checkout some tech names that are growing revenue above 30%SQ betterI think the stock will stay above $12 and probably be in the $20-30 range by the EOY.no idea sorrySo would you recommend investing in small cap or what are you thinking?They’re in totally different parts of the semiconductor supply chain, but yes you can compare anything. It’s just hard when they’re not similar.Sure! But again, I'm not saying it's a bad investment, but it's still a rather conservative pick. There's low risk of significant downside, but also a limit on upside.Would you mind telling me why my investing strategy isn’t good? What is wrong with each particular company/ETF?LVGO is my number one buy. I think they’re going to be hugeI plan to continue to add. Going to be a rollercoaster ride for sure, but long term I think it’s going to hitWise words.I agree. you'll learn but i've learned the hard way. If you think you have a better investment now, move at least 1/3 to 1/2 of it immediately and likely you'll be glad you did.Cough PCG CoughThat's a good point. Do you think any of these companies would require such a huge amount of funding that the dilution would be significant?Are you using robinhood with those 84?
after a quick google search it appears Robinhood does have recurring investments and ETFs. All that and $0 in fees. I feel like I should switch over from Stash because I pay $1 per month (and expense ratios on ETFs) and that is probably gonna add up. I wonder if there's a way to move my portfolio over as is... Would it be crazy to just sell everything and re-buy it immediately after? tesla is making own chips and dont use tegra in their cars anymore, [https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/22/18511594/tesla-new-self-driving-chip-is-here-and-this-is-your-best-look-yet](https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/22/18511594/tesla-new-self-driving-chip-is-here-and-this-is-your-best-look-yet)Do your research. Each industry has a different P/E average so it depends on the stock. Good luck **SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)** 

It is mostly know ETF of SP500 index.

It kind of the index for everybody to look and compare his performance. 

If the investor doing worse than SPY (and it is without reinvesting dividends, so it possible smaller than actual performance), in a some big time frame, maybe he need to change the mode.They'll survive but they're going to take a big hit.They could return! But there’s a chance they go bankrupt, which I wouldn’t want in a dividend portfolio and especially wouldn’t want at 40%. And that’s trailing dividend yield - I would be very surprised if they don’t cut the dividend for the foreseeable future. If they pay it they would be taking out a loan to pay it with, which leads to other problems.Thx for the info!Hope you soldYea who knows.here's growth for you: Cloud computing, 5G, clean energy, electric vehicles, e-commerce. Imagine the world in 2030, not the world in 2000.It's really just a matter of preference. My money is spread across so many different accounts I need to consolidate at some point. 

I have my 401k through Vanguard with my company, company stock through e-trade, my personal investments through schwab (because I like the website and app the best), roth IRA from when I moved my old company 401k from my other company with Fidelity, high-yield savings account through state farm.Makes sensei see you don't understand how actively traded ETFs workYes they are a growing business in learning with plenty of study help, teaching lessons, book rentals, etc. They have over 3 millions subscribers to their site. As technology continues to grow online learning will continue as well.Good point on innovation. I think i'll buy more of them now.$TSLA and $MSFT.

Not recommended for the feint of heart haha.All of those ideas sound reasonable. Penny stocks are just really sketchy and usually turn for the worst. To your point, I feel that EV production will only increase as we go on, and energy production will be increased to meet that need. Biofuels would likely take the same or even more energy to produce than EV power, especially with advancements in solar panels. Take all of this with a grain of salt, as I just started investing.Disruptive tech — any of the ARK funds (or any of the companies they hold). SQ, CRSPR, even ADBE are all stronger growth stocks than goog and amzn.thanks man..yeah, I don't plan to to option trading for a looooong while haha. just stupid penny stocks for gambling here and there, as well as my investments in ETFs and individual stocks. do wanna learn option trading a bit here and there thoughSquare seems rather overbought, wouldn't you agree?You are looking for the simple answer, but it is not.

In the market conditions we have today there is only two choices for prosper investor:

1. Gold ETF - GLD, IAU,
2. Very carefully chosen undervaluated stocks. Because growth stocks, which are mostly overvaluated, has a massive flaw inside, especially when markets will fall.Makes sense. I’ve been looking into low cost stocks with high dividend pay. And should also have some room for growth. Never actually been a fan though of the idea of the whole idea of ‘dividend investors’. And on a separate note, I’m thinking NIO is set for a takeoff.Your portfolio concentrated in Chinese company and SP500 ETF's:

1. First issue - don't trust any company coming from China, Russia or other  autocrat  ruled countries. You can't be sure if their financial data is true or not. After a while that will blow up with a big noise.
2. Second issue - Why are You so concentrated just in one company. Do you believe even yourself that you made a right decision, when you bought it?  Maybe you was wrong about this specific company?
3. Third issue - According to my analysis, Indexes in the next 2 years will provide negative results. So your portfolio will provide negative results.   
And I made a nice money from 2018, when indexes lagged me so much.Same. Very confident they will be a $100B company one day.I can see just about any of the airlines and cruise companies doing so. Delta is in a better position than most of the others, with AAL in a particularly precarious one. I haven't read all of their balance sheets but I would suggest you do. Remember that just because the company is doing fine again, doesn't mean they didn't have to burn the shareholders in the process. Look into what happened to owners of airlines following 9/11Hell yeah brotherYou could do an ACAT transfer I think which moves all your positions directly to a new broker but I believe there is usually a fee that comes with doing that.You’re betting on there not being a vaccine by years end... data leans toward vaccineRCL likely will not go bankrupt. I bought them at $29, lucky timing, and plan on hanging on to a few for a while.  I sold a couple for Nikola’s IPO and some for Boeing when they were down below $120. It’s been pretty lucrative so far.[deleted]Yeah, but which companies are going to lead in that? 5G is an unneeded tech. Clean energy is already here. There's only 1 viable electric car manufacturer and that's Tesla and it's overpriced. e-commerce is 20 years old. What's growth?Sorry i’m just being sarcastic, i’ll keep being a retard and putting money in tsla tho and maybe some voo i’m too young to give a fukGood picks! I've been a fan of Tesla for years, drive a Model 3 myself (and will never go back!), and believe the stock, even now, will be at 5000 in 3 to 6 years.Fair enough, when it comes to lower end stocks I agree and I only trade NYSE or NASDAQ stocks because of their requirements compared to manipulated stocks on other markets. I'm accepting the loss of investment in my overall portfolio due to the large amount of potential ROI. I work in fuel systems and thats part of the reason I see so many people going wrong with pouring too much into EVs at their current stage as most OEMs aren't predicting a huge shift to that market. I think GEVO could be big in the long run and HTZ is entirely a gambleAlmost everything is overbought at this rally. But SQ has better opportunity for bigger growth.Agree w/ NIOI bought two shares when it was $20 and sold when it hit $70. I didn’t think they’d grow this fastYeah I just checked and the fee for an ACAT is lower than the amount I'd pay in taxes to sell and re-buy. Unfortunately, Robinhood isn't accepting incoming ACAT transfers at this time, so I'm stuck :( 

I think it's fine. I went back and checked and my selected ETF's are all very cheap.. (Expense ratios Below 0.1%). The $1 monthly fees is about 0.48% of my total portfolio and that changes to 0.25% once you invest 5k in the app, that doesn't seem crazy expensive. Correct me if I'm wrong plsI realize there could be a vaccine by the end of the year and that would be great for cruise lines. But I’m not comfortable investing 40% in a company that’s partly banking on that.Shit I didn’t realize I was dealing with a professional investor here, I apologize. You’re right, burning through cash and making no money means that there’s no chance of chapter 11 bankruptcy. Carry on.i just buy them all.If you think Tesla is overpriced now, just wait until the next 2-3 years. It's extremely volatile so buy on the dips and hold. Ive been buying since $400 and everytime i say i want to sell, i cannot bring myself to doing it because there is not really any other stock i would want my $ in right now. Already holding all the MSFT, AMZN, APPL, FB that i need.Nice. After this run up I was tempted to buy my family a bunch of tesla as a flex for getting Cs in high school... 

Still might hahaMaybe you sold to me, I bought at $70 haha. Bought about 20 shares though, made them my 2nd biggest holding after MA.Yeah $1 a month isn't much to worry about.That makes one of us. 50% in nclh with limit buys at 17$. No other stock down 3x sitting on 3.5b...?I came to offer my opinion and advice, it’s exactly that. I can tell by your sharp comments you know more about investing than me. 

What is your opinion and advice?  Please leave advise rather than leaving deconstructive remarks and maybe I can learn something.Good luck to you, I'm currently not skilled enough to do such a strategy. Is it a proven strat to just buy an entire new industry? I mean, look at how marijuana stocks turned out, it turned out the entire industry wasn't viable. If you want to be an early mover, why not just wait and see if the industry is really taking off before investing. Investing 5 years after the start is still really early. Even if you invested 10 years after Amazon went public you would still 30x your money.Very nice. I just sold my AMD and bought two shares, I’ll pick up some more AMD in the near futureMore power to you. FWIW I like Norwegian best out of the cruise lines.I left my advice and reasoning for OP before you came in with a non-constructive argument.no strategy is proven and no strategy is inherently better than any other. Most DD is priced in so you have to out think the market. High P/Es are high for a reason. and low P/E's are low for a reason

my picks are aapl, alb, amd, amzn, baba, cci, goog, msft, nio, nvda, qcom, sq, swks, tsla, z, rdfn[deleted]Yeah, honestly a big fan of the portfolio now despite my RCL hesitations.Stocks only go down so they can go up more, but other than that stocks can only go upMarket goes down like 1% for 2 days and people talk about the bubble bursting and start selling stuff lolTesla is going down harder than HeatherideepthroatMSFT under 200
AAPL under 370
NVDA under 400
SPOT under 265
SHOP under 930
ZM under 245
AMZN under 3000
ARKK under 80
NET under 36Been taking these past few days to get in on some MSFT.With AMD overvalued now, y'all think buying the Intel dip is the move?Wow amd 😻 where the intc bulls at? LosersI understand TQQQ is 3x the daily performance of QQQ, but when does it rebalance? Or, in other words, 3x the performance from when -- market open to close?AMD is killing it!Fucking hell is real red out there, I'm staying indoorsWith AMD expecting to do great on the earnings call where do you think it will end up sitting around? 67? 70?Is GOOG a good buy at 1490-1495? I\`m thinking of buying a stock of GOOG and one MSFTrip nkla CZR keeps getting hammeredI really don't care if it effects volume/liquidity/robustness, the stockmarket needs to remain open 24/7 on weekdays. I am sick of 99% of reports/news taking place during pre/post market. 

Between premium discords, bigwigs getting behind the scenes information before it is released to the public, and more, there are many players that get to take advantage of news when it benefits them the most. 

There are wayyyyy too many high volume positive trends occuring with no public news. SEC either needs to get on that shit HARD or allow access to the market when news comes out.AMD is siphoning Intel's life force right nowI get that today is "red" but the magnitude of the fall is really small today compared to yesterday outside of a few specific stocks like Intel. 

Going through high-rated stocks the biggest dips I could find were like 5%, and this plays out on the macro level with tiny dips on the S&P and DJIA of like half a percent. 

Overall today is too boring for me to want to buy or sell anything.Your Weekly /r/stocks Recap

I often see toted that they have a +25% return on their #1 rank stocks (as in "Strong Buy"), but seemingly offer nothing to actually back that up.

Anyone have any experience with it? I noticed it has a 30-day free trial, so I may give that a go. Otherwise it's $250/year.**Subreddit:** /r/stocks

Financial data provided by [finviz](https://finviz.com/).Does anyone believe this could be the beginning Of the stock market tanking againIB just gave me a notification that GAN has another analyst suggesting it will outperform. I know that analyst targets are hit or miss, but I love seeing it. Even though the "Average Target" on there is $15.65, I'm starting to see more and more suggesting it's a buy. 

I'm really interested in GAN going forward, and I want to add more shares. My hope is that it takes another dip, down to under $22 so I can grab more.

My portfolio leans more into the technology sector (specifically NET and MU), but GAN is the one I think has the most promise in the next year to two years.sold my novavax wed, market dumped thurs, looks like fri will be another red day.

im not buying back into nvax even though im thinking its gonna skyrocket back up after this small dip.  i need something cheap and dank to buy into todayApple calls ?My complete I fucked up yesterday move was not dumping INTC and going in on AMD and TSM.

I can't seem to express my question.

Let's say I have 10,000 in a stock, and I have a crystal ball that says it's going to decline by 10% next week.  How can I **easily** figure out whether it's better to sell and take the tax hit or keep it and wait for the rebound?TGB saving my dayWhat\`s the difference between me purchasing  VUSA (Vanguard S&P 500) on my freetrade app vs Signing up online to the Vanguard VUSA ETF from their website?

Freetrade has no comission or costs for VUSA as it\`s a GDP price, so can I negate the 0.07% Vanguard comission this way?

Cheers guys.Do we think AMD is going to enjoy going up for a while due to everything going on? Finna hit $70BNTX a buy at $83? I got in before they spiked earlier this week but news of their offering (at $93/share) pushed it down quite a bit. A lot of the positive vaccine progress was probably priced in but the reaction to news earlier this week still tells me there is upside to be had with more progress.What to do with Hyliion? I guess what I can do is just average down, hold and wait for merge huh1) For anyone that's intending to hold long term (10-15 years) is there any reason at all to worry about any of current spikes/dips of stock in S&P 500? 

2) Also - I bought TSLA at it's high: $1710

Is it worth just holding onto it for a long term or sell it at a loss? ( am more inclined towards holding long term)I am new to selling put options so I am a bit lost placed a put option at a strike price of 15.50 for MGM 2 weeks ago and I see that today at 10am it hit that price point. So i should own 100 MGM shares now no? But when i log into my account it shows the option contract as still validDo you all think buying Monday is the right move? Or are we going to continue to see red all next week?Everything is red except for my Amd and cruiseline stocks 😂I’m thinking of selling my whole portfolio at a massive loss right now talk me down from this ledge, is market going to March lows?Red day means buy day, got some good deals!Tsla bulls shook. Is this really worth 200b+? I think notGot some Spotify at $260for almost 2 decades of trading i've seen quite a lot that went down and never recovered. as a matter of fact, it's a common thing for a company to simply become not-as-relevant or lagging behind the market, or having competition popping up and the stock simply sinks into a endless downward cycle.   


Very common.   


WDC, GT, M, VOD, BBBY, and latest - TRIP  


Wide range of businesses and yet they stocks go down, some for years, and probably never will return to past prices.To be fair most people are focused more on the specific impact to tech stocks which are down as much as 10-20% this weekI’ve never panic sold in my life and I’m ahead about 150% over my ten years investing which is better than the average.NiceLooks like a lot of tech is dropping. Not just Tesla.Cash gang got our back. They been waiting on the sidelines for this.Once again no one mentioning ADBE for whatever reason. That had the best discount out of all of these not too long ago.Intel will probably drop low and stay low for a while due to their chip delays and amd moving into their market more and more.If AMD has a great earnings call, Intel will probably dump againGet fucked ShintelI think someone broke the AMD cash printer it won’t stop giving me moneyThe appropriate meme for this would be:

y'allgotanymoreofthemprofits?.jpgAMD did nothing to earn this spike lol[deleted]I'm regretting not getting in around 50I said in here before it would never hit 50 again 😉I think it might touch 69 before dumping, 60 was too recent. But my advice might be BS because shit is crazy right now and in this market it might fucking hit 80.Nobody knows. To put it in perspective just last week the complaint here was AMD can’t break past 55. Yet here we are, morale of the story go with what you thinkXbox just revealed its new system and I think it’s going to have record sales looks goodMy put made some money. Wish I had bought more than 1.I feel like that would fuck people even moreForex is basically 24/7 if you’re interestedI just bought INTC callsAMD is gonna get all the government work if intel can’t produce. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀Take out a lower interest loan against the equity in your house.Sell higher calls against themCan VIX please hit 30+ so I can sell my calls for a nice profit?I think AAPL and MSFT are.As someone who bought AAPL recently at $387 and $371, and MSFT at $209, they are both looking more attractive by the minute.The signs are not looking good in terms of housing evictions and bad stimulus news, I think a pullback will happen but not on a March levelMaybe but maybe it’ll pumpWho knows but i did sell a few shares to have cash in hand to get a better deal on stocks bc at least for today i feel stocks will tank a bit morei thought this too.  im starting to see the top of the hill, then the gradual downward slope..  if it is.. oh fucking well, imma just ride it out and buy at the bottom again.

its gonna dump, but not as hard as march, go back years and you'll see these small dumps on the way up..  this will come soon enough.  probably next week.NopeIs GAN considered tech or consumer discretionary?I love GAN. Have a cost basis of $18 and am waiting for it to go down more. This and DKNG were big hits latelyI got one, I’m not expertI was going to buy more AMD yesterday when it dropped 4%. I missed out.AMD up 12% how is that badVI wishWICLNI bought it at 36.8 and will be holding.Huh? You don’t pay taxes on losses.I’m holding mine until I see record breaking console sales in 4th quarterWhen is the merge, end of 3Q?At that price I don’t know if it’ll ever get there again but that stock doesn’t make any sense so it mightIf your interested in holding for 10 to 15 years you don't have to worry about selling. You will make a profit if you pick well. I personally like tesla and the products they make. However they our way overvalued at this point and I feel they may crash again soon. I bought them at 450 and sold at 1300 a while back. I would sell tesla and any other stocks. I have sold 95 precent of my portfolio only keeping 1000 dollars worth of "lspd". Everything else is gone. I believe the market will crash soon. Especially Tech stocks. I don't know how many tesla shares you own but I would sell. I see this being the highest they will be for awhile. Good luck to you.You only get assigned the shares if the price is under your strike at the close of the market.  Then it takes a  day or two to see them on your portfolio.It's only a loss if you cash out, don't look at it for 5-10 years./s?Nobody knows man. Just buy more and average down your cost.Sell Sell Sell, buy again on monday at the decline :) GLHFIt's going lower over the next few weeks, especially tech. Go to gold, silver, and crypto which usually go opposite market.I spent my kids college money with full margin and bought at 1794 and panic sold at 1372. Should I buy back?Overpriced bruh. It’s a freaking APP!!? Which tech stocks are down 10-20% this week? Even memes like zm and spce are not down that much

Edit: oh I see Intel is hemorrhaging.everything but AMD. Of course the one I sold covered calls..Yup,  but 10% is a pretty big drop.  Watch it be at 1800 by the end of the day with the way things are.Couple this with Apple dropping them, things are not looking spectacular over at IntelLmao loses 45B market cap just like that. AMD only 70 B total.The cash printer must have an Intel processor rofl!lol not their fault intel sucks assI guess you're right, that would be awesome. I think AMD has great stuff and hope we keep on climbing.Word. I was going to hold my call until the earnings but with the p/e I almost want to chicken out.Not a bad move. I'm long AMD but Intel hemorraghing is a bit of an overreaction right now especially since they had pretty strong numbers this quarter apart from the 7nm delay newsRip money furnaceUsername checks outThanks. I’m only going in small while I’m still learning. I’ve got 4 (buy) calls 1600 and 2 (sell) calls 1650Thanks, I'm looking to pull the trigger, just wondering if we have another few days of drops.Not sure why nobody's talking about ADBE. The stock fell to like $416, and nobody was even talking about it then...I’m planning on holding till Monday. if Monday comes around and we’re still burning Im taking profitOn IB it's under Tech, but I consider it consumer as well. It bridges both, but I could be swayed either way.Agreed. I don't have any DKNG, and I got GAN at around 24.I didn’t say that right. I held onto intc and did not buy in on amd.Yeah, losses actually count *against* taxes on whatever capital gains you may haveHeheheheYup, speculated on end of 3Q but anything can happen, right?It's not really money I rely/depend on, when I bought it I went for 50/50 risk and I assumed loss.

So I guess it's worth just keeping at this point?Ahhj ok yea at the close of the market it was above 15.50. Damn it i was excited to get those MGM shares haha.What else does your crystal ball say? really hope your joking, but your post history suggest you really are that stupidYes asapNo. Wait another week or two. Many earnings our coming out next week and especially Tech stocks. This could majorly affect Tesla's price.It’s the best music platform on the market that’s breaking into podcasting. I believe in the company a lotNetflix is an app too brothaDon't make the mistake of looking at the present moment with growth stocks. Its all about the story and where it leads you.You’re right, compared to last week most things are fine. I should have said the impact of the last few days (MSFT, INTC, GOOG, Slack, Spotify) is what people are stressed about.That could all change on the 28th with the earnings reportSure, it's a volatile stock so it'll swing pretty hard, but the fact that it's going down in conjunction with the tech industry means this isn't due to a failing on Tesla's end.My Intel position is still up 94.38%, sorry that you're 19.Those are my thoughts exactly. 

The 52.50c for 10/16 should be a pretty safe bet at less than $2.50.The calls are only at 52.50. I think today was a bit of an overreaction and should creep back to that number. I'm just looking for a 10-20% gain on them.That, btw, is a call debit spread. 2 of them to be exact, with 2 extra long calls. Buying call debit spreads is how I started too. I've learned that there is a better way to place this exact same trade though. 

A put credit spread sounds like the opposite, but it's actually get similar bias wise. So, imagine being the person who bought/sold you those calls. They have $5000 held for collateral and are hoping your contacts expire worthless so that not of it is used, but they get to keep your premium. So buy selling a call spread  you are being for the stock to go down below the lower strike. Now imagine it's puts instead, puts are opposite of calls and so you would be being that the stock price will be above the higher put strike. 

Why would we want to do this? Because option prices decay over time. When buying options, you have to be right about the movement, but you also have to be right about WHEN it will move. If you sold the option though, and are eventually going to buy it back to close the spread, the time decay works in your favor. 

Added perks: 
Puts usually are more expensive, and you're selling them, so that's good. 
You have to lock up collateral but you take in credit to offset a good amount of that immediately. 

The only con I can think of is that the collateral requirement in selling a spread tends to lock up more money than buying the spread. In my experience your increased chance of actually turning a profit, mostly due to time decay (theta), more than makes up for the extra up front capital.

You'd think you would lose more per trade this way, I did too. But when you set them up correctly, high probably debit spreads cost more per profit potential, if that makes sense. 

Pro tip: selling a single credit spread is alright, but you can sell the opposite spread on the other side of the stock price using the same collateral because only one can possible lose at one time. This is called an iron condor and they have been making me a few thousand per month for a few months now, in my under 25k account.

Have you heard of tasty trade? Look em up on YouTube if you haven't. They tailor advice for small (under 25k) accounts.I don't think it matters. If you want to invest in them, now is a good time. I don't have the funds right now (IB takes forever to clear deposits), but I would be OK with MSFT at 210 and AAPL at 370. Both aren't going anywhere.you can’t time the market. what’s your time horizon? if it’s forever, just buy more and buy more over the course of the futureWhat tells you they have more room for growth?DKNG started at around 17 or so but I bought in when it kept going up. Still think it’ll hit high 40’s soon. GAN is going to be huge very soon. Hopefully it gets to $22 this afternoon or Monday.Well it’ll probably recover somewhat so at least wait until next couple of Green Day’sI see you, surrounded by shiny objects in the near future.Community college it is... sorry kidsyeah i like spotify, it has the advantage like roku of being the middle ground between the whales who hate each other (amazon, google, apple)It’s a great app.. I use it very often but I do think it’s current valuation is accurate. Before March lows it was trading in the 140 range. 

Now it doubled in price? For what? What has it done?And Netflix is overpriced too lolI bought MSFT today and also INTC callsI just bought callsKeep holding lmaoWow, thank you so much for taking the time to write this. I’ll be sure to look into everything that you mentioned. 
Thank you, enjoy your weekendShit... if it gets under $23, I'm getting more. $22 would make me really happy.I knew the aliens were gonna come and probe me!Joe rogan deal and the kardashian deal show it’s serious about the podcasting space.MSFT is a steal at any price if you buy for anything longer than 1 year. INTC is a risky play.RipIf they have time travel, I wanna go back and unsell my ETSY shares. Let me know.and Michelle Obama now.The calls are only at 52.50. I think today was a bit of an overreaction and should creep back to that number. I'm just looking for a 10-20% gain on them. Definitely more risky than MSFT.The calls are only at 52.50. I think today was a bit of an overreaction and should creep back to that number. I'm just looking for a 10-20% gain on them.Apple has free podcastSmart I wouldn't hold it long. Intc is a slowly sinking shipSo true, I almost panic sold yesterday but instead I was able to turn my $700 loss into an $8000 loss!I don't feel so good Mr starkThe dow is down one half of one percent.  Do people really start freaking out if stocks do anything but double every day?In some good news... It looks like AMD is leaving that resistance line behind.

Which is cool but it's probably just because of the Intel chip delay news.You make too much sense, panic sell it is.


EDIT: First time I’ve ever received an award on reddit, actually first award ever, I am honored.Instead of panicking about money lost, I'm panicking about whether to buy more during today's little dip or wait till Monday.

But hey, as long as we're panicking, SELL EVERYTHING!lols do you guys already forget the 7% daily shifts in March?!To me, 3 days of red is hardly a sale after a month of green, imho.AMD killin it thoGoing to try my best to just not look today. Bought apple yesterday when I thought it bottomed out at $370 but looks like it continued to fall overnight.

Emotions blur logic, I'm choosing to not watch for for nowSPY down a whopping 0.5% at the time of writing this, in an extremely volatile time.

“SEA OF RED, STAY STRONG FOLKS”

HahahahaI got paid today and it's the 2nd day of a niiice pullback.

This is like Christmas to meI love Tesla, I believe in the company, but damn I had trouble believing in the price and sold today. Decent profits still, but wanting to stash my money somewhere safer for a bit.

EDIT: Safer = MSFT & APPLI hope it drops more so I can buy moreProblem is... A LOT of people don't believe in their stocks.I'm actually happy it's red today. Been holding on to some cash, so now might be the right time to buy some stocks!Always hurts to see red but as long as you don’t sell you haven’t lost any moneyMe looking at my 390 aapl call now worth .01

Hmm, I think I'll holdWhen should I buy in to take advantage?
Monday morning or sometime today??I don't understand people panicking right now. So some stock dropped a few percent recently. Now what? Your personal price target didn't change, e.g. if you personally believe that TSLA will be trading at 3000$ one day why does a temporary drop from 1,600 to 1,400 scare someone? If anything, it's just a good opportunity to load more.Lol this sub is hilarious. The market is down like 3% the last couple days. 

It was almost back to all time highs. 

Rela> **USER REPORTS**

Maybe everyone should relax a little when the market goes down less than 1%Elon Musk bring us back to $1700.

Amen.stay strong...just buy more buy more.

time to be greeedyyyyyyMan, i Really want to sell my Tesla, but not sure if I should or not. Last time I did it, I kinda regret itTell that to my INTC position :DRIP my hydrogen stocks.

Also RIP my other stocks, except of AMD.


But honestly, take any successful stock and zoom out. You will see how many times the stock went down but still has recovered and beat ATH.

Make some tea, relax. Everything passes, this will pass too.I'm selling. I don't have confidence that Republicans are going to put forward a big enough stimulus to keep the market afloat, let alone excite it.Lost another $1000 from TSLA today when I bought after earnings on Wednesday. LolMarket down 0.65% is sea of red now? Sheesh. What were you saying when we had 5-10% moves?Considering some AMZN calls...pricey but on a steep discount for sure.Looks like I chose a good time to switch brokeragesBut is this really a “sale” ?Im holding onto my Tesla stocks, i want to take a powernap but im afraid i’ll wake up in a nightmareThis was the top, fellas. Hold if you’re planning on holding for at least 5 years, otherwise now is the time to sell snd hold cash, precious metals, and bonds.Yes we know how the stock market works, thanks dad.Fucking rediculous these posts. Everytime the market drops a bit you guys lose your fucking minds.Do we really need 500 of these posts every red day?

If you get that scared because of a red day you shouldn’t be in the market.Are these posts on this sub all made by teenagers ? Dow down less than %1 we need a stay strong hold post?WHERE THE DUCK IS A SEA OF RED?This is the gayest thing I’ve read all dayAmen.  Best to log off for the weekend.  Gonna be a bloodbath today running into Monday.  Then buy buy buy!I have a put credit spread on Tesla and Amazon. When I placed the trade Monday I felt like it was the easiest money. Now I’m sweating a bit.I saw 2 articles come up saying stocks are falling oh woe is me! Then I look at my percentages and they are down 2% so I shrugged and kept everythingAMD skyrocketing is keeping me green.New day to buy in, love it!Grow some balls people. Stay strong. That's what I learned this year.
Never stop going big dick!"...spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered, a sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!..."

- King Théoden

I always think of this quote when it's a red day$SLB was a decent gain today.Week straight of red. Could this be the .2nd stock market crash aka repeat of March?i thought i bought at a dip. but it keeps
dipping :)How the fuck are people panicking about companies like Microsoft and Apple???? ChillFucking Intel. I don't have any shares, but they fucked up. Delayed their next gen chips at the same time AMD introduces their new chips. That's no bueno. Down 15% at 10:27am CST.Well said.  I knew, and even commented, that I should have sold my stocks last week to lock in the max gains.

Now it's too late, so have to weather the Red Sea until the next  high tide rolls in...💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽This post just stopped me from selling at a 22% lost.  Thank you for the encouragement.AMD says, not today!Holding onto NIO...any thoughts after a week of losses. It's one of those companies I just bought a few shares of and slowly am building over time. Worried of the future though.As someone who just started stocks the drop now is actually pretty helpful to me. I’m buying in. :)If the S&P being down by half a percent is a panicky day for you, you're going to have a very rude awakening in the future...The main indexes are down less than a percent. This is not a sea of red. This is a raindrop of red.We are really gonna get a post like this every time huh :(This too shall pass homies :DThere’s literally a post like this every red day. SheeshI like red days. More opportunities to buy more. If you’re in it for the long haul and manage your money right there is nothing to worry about. 

The only reason to worry is if you’re treating it like a savings account and it’s money you need access to soon."A sea of red". S&P went 0.6% down and the Nasdaq about 0.9%. Every stock you believe in is probably already overvalued. If you're ready to hold your stocks +10 years then hold it. If not, think twice.$EVRI and $UAVS to THE MOOOooooOOOOOoooooooOOOn *Auto Tune Voice*IM PANICKING BECAUSE I DONT HAVE MORE MONEY TO INVESSSSST!!!!!Only lost some money in intel and amazon, everything else is still green <3Another low quality postNext +700 dow day imma post this same thread for shortsIts simple, every time SPY gets close to 330, get puts. When it gets back to 300 buy calls. Literally can call it every fucking time like clockwork.Lmfao SPY has a -0.5% day and you're over here saying "have some balls". Jesus fucking christ, the risk tolerance of a 114 year old Chinese woman.Instructions unclear, dick stuck in Aurora Canabis and Occidental Petroleum.A lotta red today but what on earth happened to Intel? I thought they beat expectations. A drop? Sure. But over 16%? Did not expect that..Is the automated trading going haywire?  The numbers are jumping around so muchI need your words of encouragement. I supposed to be long on my position in a large cap ETF. im at all time low right now at -5% portfolio...Fuck wb Tesla any day indications it will go back up ?Smash Market Sell, got itIAU options with ITM calls for August a popping Big time! Makes me worry about market as a whole.I'm a long hauler. Must be in the wrong place. 

“Sell, Mortimer!  Sell!”even tesla?Idk what you're talkin' about. TSM up 10%. God I wish I didn't sell at $63.I thought we no longer wanted posts like these?Enough red to start buying maybe? Or not yet...What are stonks?Days like this is when you start initiating a position or add to existing ones. I am looking to start buying SHOP at 800$. What do you guys think? Earning on July 29th.Whew, overall only down 2.7%... but it is only 10AM...Buyers market. Really wish I had more cash laying around to jump in. Everything's on sale.Sold about 30K of Tesla between Monday and today. Now we wait until next Monday to jump back in.I held through yesterday’s downturn and for whatever reason I am up across the board so far. Idk what’s going on but I’m scared to do anythingWas it way worse this morning? I saw this thread and though oh shit. Logged into my acct and was like. Wtf? My fb down a bit but overall it just looks like a typical down dayWelp my trailing stop triggered for MSFT. I no longer have MSFT ughI've closed my app and battened down the hatches.Just gotta be in the right sectors. Energy is doing great this morningNot sure what you're talking about but I'm up! 

Still  shopping though.I had a little bit of cash that just cleared into my Roth. Was planning on DCA, but WTH might just throw it all in today.CPE is keeping me green today so far.How do you anticipate a red sea today?  What things are looked?I'm just annoyed i don't have more cash to add :(AMD and TSMC holding me up today!True. Just buy good stocks and you will sleep better. Watch this! [Large cap stocks](https://youtu.be/b50k46U5tDA) and this! [Best performing stocks ](https://youtu.be/BOsxgKk2tXY)Bought more tencent today. Sad to see the red sea but glad to know it'll hopefully jump back up soon...You can believe in your stocks and have zero faith in this market.Sweet! My limit order on MSFT went thru! :DBought intel at a really reasonable price today. I love red daysAll me oil/energy stocks are up. Even carnival. We'll see how the day unfolds thoughLol what redI cant wait to see what gdp report actually is thats forecasted at -34% in 6 days!Oh look, it's that post again.AMD omgggg just when i sold it!!!!I love it when market goes negative. I get stock at discount. Also I don’t own any option or leverage so I am not worried. But I see what you saying, if you are a trader in this market you can easily get whipped offSLQT down hella low. No bad news just bottom dropped out 🤷‍♂️ I bought in and it keeps sinking. See y'all at the food bank later!Let it drop further I’ve been waiting to buy.I've been in the green for two days, my portfolio seems to be holding up for the momentYou say this... and yet my Stop Losses that I never imagined would trigger... triggered in early morning.  


Bye bye money.I have 340 shares of Intel and I sold AMD at $54.

Hold me.Dude I just bought some gold, I used to mad trade it around 2009-12 
I totally forgot how boring and lucrative it is.
I just bought it this morning 1887? went to sleep closed at 1901 when I woke up. Free money
Gonnabbuy some more when it drops back a little
Forgot how boring it is. Cheers gold bugs and doomers.I bought KO this morning, figured it was about a safe a play as any time makeI’m holding my stock and my balls.I've been selling for the past 2 weeks and have a 40% cash position. I'm waiting for more opportunity than just two red days that if we're being honest weren't even that bad.Yesterday my friend sends me an email about investments that make me question my entire portfolio.  Today I have to just remain calm and realize I've already committed, and focus more on bargains and resign myself to the fact that I can't just do a 180 on my investment strategy today.What are you buying with this dip?What do I do if I don’t believe in any of my stocksSimple but practical & good advice. Unfortunately, no buying power left so I cannot take advantage of saleS&p 500 isn't even 0.5% down.Orange man must be shaking right now, his deflection tactics on Chinar just backfired on his precious stonk market.Bought MSFT 8/14 $210 this morning, already up 15%.  Scared to hold through the weekend though.😵🔫 Don’t know what you’re on. I’m up .02%!!! better than my savings account.I must be well diversified, I’m only down 0.75%Buying the dips 🥴Big discounts todayI'm doing pretty good today.  Only down $17!  But I don't have much tech exposure.Not to be pimping stocks here, but KHC is one of few ( and a couple of other staples) that have survived this two day sell off.Ok, I’ll check it out and see if i qualify. Probably a slim chance, but doesn’t hurt to ask.This is probably the best day I've had in the last 4 months.  AMD is lifting off.This is the first day since march that my entire portfolio is red, every single stock. So I had quite the "what the fuck happened and why". I hold both defensive and offensive stocks. Usually they don't drop together.

On top of that I added to one of my favorite stocks today just an hour after open, and not even 30min after that it dropped 5%. So fuck me sideways, I won't sell though. But fucking hell, is my karma account that echausted?LAC is green. NAK will go up.Almost sold my calls on RUN but realize the up trend is still strong on different timelines. 

RUN is my bitch, not the other way around.K12 in the green, thats all I care about.What would be some great mid to long term pickups today? Right now I dont have much besides about 2400$ liquid.I just bought my first stocks. And im happy to see them down. Now I can buy moreShould you buy any today?Market goes up more than 10% on a day, no one blinks an eye.
Market goes down a few %, everyone loses their god damn mind.

Based $AMDWe're down less than a percent and people are panicking?Hold me plz But I was told stonks only go up?HOOOOOOOOOLD SPARRRRRTAAAAAAAANS!I guess were going to find out who's a real investor and who's gambling with their moneyAm I the only one making money today? Just sold $SAM at $792 after it gained over $100 today. Where do you think the correction is going to stop?Sold right when it started to drop yesterday and bought back this morning. Got 36 more shares now than I had. Win some lose some.Ay mates don’t worry it’s just some China USA tensions it will blow away.I dropped my balls upon Intel 15% drop..Perfect buying opportunity!Amd and Gld saving my ass todayWaiting to see how the market trades during the last 30 minutes of trading.  Hopefully we get some buying momentum going into the weekend.

I think this week a lot of big time traders and market makers are taking profits, or allocating their funds away from tech into something else - probably gold and silver.Unless of course the stocks you're buying are quality names that became overinflated pieces of steaming trash and you kept buying out of greed, that is. Every minor red day is a sea of panic now, like people know the gig is up. I think once institutional dumps start happening this fear is going to cave current valuations in a brutal way.I just sprinkle on a bit more into my stocks and call it getting a deal on my normal stock investmentsI'm just salty that AMD is finally breaking out, but it is doing it on a sea of red.Has anyone owned NVAX?  Any thoughts?We need more stimulusWtf stocks are supposed to go upThe problem is it seems most people on here don't care for valuation metrics. Instead it's 'Me see stock go up so me buy'. Or 'Me like this company so me buy'. How can you have confidence and believe in your companies when you made your decision on less time than it takes do buy a pack of cigarettes? It's geniunely shocking to see how lacking in knowledge the posts on here are.lol AMD GANG NO RED DAYSI had a lot in amd so I'm Gucci 😎Im green amaSell so I can buyMeh, all my stocks are in companies that are highly unlikely to go bust, and I bought them when they were already low (covid recession lows). I'll just wait it out, whether it's a few months or a year or more, I don't mind.I was planning on increasing my cash on hand and also wanted to rebalance my IRA and Roth. I sold yesterday morning but didn't invest it back. Looks like I got lucky but now I don't know what to do. 

I had a list of stocks that I wanted to buy yesterday most of them are down and I want to buy them but my mind is saying wait, lets see what happens on Monday.

I don't want to time the market but the urge is so strong.

Please help.My broke ass deposited enough to scoop Microsoft on the dip. Be confident people!!The world is crashing!!! While in California House market is in the all time high!? How is this possible when everyone is unemployed... 🤔SPY is down less than 1%. What am I missing here?Yes today was a great day 


https://imgur.com/gallery/DEdHM4VI was deep in AMD calls and intc puts, 170% today. Got aapl and arkk calls with the money from the intel putsI make the most money day trading in days like this! Better bargains to buy.I got some long INTC calls, and SWBI calls.  They were at a discount.Directions unclear. Still holding ballsWhy are people freaking out so bad?It's okay all my stocks are red but I was rescued by amdGlad 60% of my portfolio is in AMD. Started taking profits but Wanted to wait till closer to earnings. This growth seems unhealthy.I only have shares in AMD lol100% of my portfolio is AMDI sold my apples today. Still not sure if I made the right call.I’m poorI sold and for 57, f me but I only had 10 shares anyway so not a big hit.

Bought 1 at 66 though lol.Good day to own AMD.NIO and ARKK ! 💪It’s a couple of red days after months and months of green. What’s with all the “stay strong” bs? Some of you guys really shouldn’t be putting money in the stock market if a day or two like this one wrecks your nerves.Incoming bear marketOh god damn it....this hurts :,(Thanks just sold $100kLooks like you guys are not used to markets going down. Must be RH tradersJesus take the wheel, this hurtsSo Tesla $3000 calls aren't going to print money by next week I guess?Time to sell man, this is just the startAppreciate this.  Thanks for the reminder.Same damn post every damn time stocks go red.Literally the same posts every other dayOnly down 1% currently and only have about 1.2k invested but damn looking at tesla... some people hurting. I’m still relevantly new at investing but I would say hold.There are posts like this every time there’s a red dayI remember when my friend was dollar cost averaging everyday for the past 6-8 years into VTI and VTSAX, and says that it’s a good method. I did the same, but I averaged only very minute amounts because I was still cautious. Then when March hit, I threw the farm at VTSAX and VTI, and while my gains aren’t equal to my friend who has been in it for the past 6-8 years it’s pretty close to it.

Moral of the story - know your entry point. You can’t time it, but sitting on cash is never a bad thing.I believe in the company's i have invested in, i just dont believe in the us economy as a whole at the momentThat’s cuteBad advice. Stick to your stop sells.These kinds of posts make me want to leave this subreddit. Stay strong for what? Nothing is happening.Lmfao these posts are fucking ridiculous.These posts are fucking stupidThe state of this sub... the DOW is down 0.7% and there’s posters hunting for karma telling people to stay strong. If you’re upvoting this shit and you’re struggling not to sell on a -0.7% day (especially when we had multiple -7% days in March) then investing really isn’t for you.Believe? Stocks are not religion. What to fuck you have to believe?
You need to know fundamentals, read prospectus and reports,  analyze company from every angle.
How many of morons buying sticks today are doing homework?
Idiots are thinking it's only winning game and stocks will go only up.
Well they won't.
Remember: guys on the other side ALWAYS know more about particular stock from you!
Plus: you are actually trading against powerfully supercomputers and highly developed algorithms. 
No chance to win.Is there any point in selling now, waiting for the full dip, then buying back then? Or does any money I've currently lost make re-investing the dip with less money not worth it?I'm in it for the long haul.. my £100 will make me a billionaire one day......Ah yes, the sage financial wisdom of Belief.

Y’all make tent revivalists look rational.Imagine posting a thread like this when stocks have recently posted ATHs lolPanic sold 10 TSLA.  Realized my mistake.  Bought 12.sea of read? im still 2 euro in the greens :)**I think this is like Feb, 2020. Market will be Up for sometime. But March like Dip might be on the way!** **#prediction****Don't stay strong guys**. Have a f\*cking stop loss and proper risk management and stick to it. Don't hold forever then lose even more. Market fundamentals are not pointing to a speedy recovery anytime soon.
sea of red lol? This isn't even a "dip", it's just normal volatility.You guys are crazy to hold anything"Sea of red."  SPY is down like 5 points today, but up nearly 7% from a month ago, despite a consistent drum beat of apocalyptic economic news, that has simply been ignored, so far.  If you think today is a blood bath, wait until schools don't open in a couple weeks and white-collar layoffs and overall unemployment start growing again.Ideas about "staying strong" are bull shit.  The stock market is a gym workout.  If you think this is temporary, hold.  If you think this is a real decline, sell.  I already sold a few days ago because I think the market is held up by nothing but money printing and the fed has been decreasing its balance sheet for a few weeks now (with rise from last last week).This thread is laughable, the fact that a 1% move in the market is even worth talking about, to the fact that this is considered a “discount” opportunity to buy more, and then the fact the half of the people here can’t even hold a position for more than a week just so they can pay a ton of taxes on short term gains. good luck “investing” for the long termStay strong, the market is down less than 1%.... patheticit's less then a two percent drop today for tech who the hell is freaking out if they are then they need to invest in something other then stocksThanks for the pep talk dweebYou guys are absolute pussysEvery red day we have one of these posts from some hero we don't deserve or need. I wonder does anyone actually think about selling but then reconsider because of post like this?not "sale" when the  stocks are still way too parabolic even after this dip lol.Thank you but no thank you

That's a sure way to convince yourself that things will be green again, all the way down to huge losses

Selling the moment the market starts descending then buying back in once it starts recovering is much safer and elads to healthy profitsYes panic selling is not good, but also remember the market is about to tank. Another round of stimulus very likely. Unemployment could be extended, also more PPP loans very likely. Just be careful and always secure profits.r/wallstreetbets fashion says you only lose money if you sell.This comment triggered my American Airlines PTSDF*unrealized loss 🙃This is the wayI almost panic sold my banks calls a month ago, then I realized how stupid that would be. Now they've lost 80% of their value. Hell yeah!!Try $50k~ over here unrealized gains wipe offYou are not listening to OP's advice properly. Now if you have bought stocks on sale yesterday, you could have made $16,000 loss instead of measly $8kMe with my $50 SPY call loss turning into a $300 lose todayBuy high sell lowI was able to turn my 3k loss into an 8k loss by not just cashing out options at open; I feel ya.What stock did you lose on and why the fucks didn't you set atop loss?8k isn’t anything to cry about*Mr stonks

FTFYI don’t feel so good Mr stockyesWhen I saw this thread I assumed that the S&P fell 10%+. Then I checked and realized its currently down 0.34%. if anyone needs a reddit post to tell them to not panic over a 0.34% drop then they should not be investing.You must be new around these parts.thank you for another voice of reason... it's actually annoying me to see these kind of posts every time the market goes slightly red after another week of pure green.This is how you know you are in a bubble. Insane valuations, the prices have to keep rising or the herd begins to panic.If you own TQQQ then that's more like 1.5%. 
Bankruptcy court, here I come.Well yeah, all these people argue for active trading by looking at potential gains between minimums and maximums. Every red day could be a maximum so they flip their shit lol.there are still a lot of folks anticipating another big crash so as soon as you get any kind of slide you see a gaggle of folks assuming it is the next big one. to be honest I kind of wish it would you can work with big dip but if anything i suspect it is more likely that we will see a year or two of lackluster growth on the market as a whole when some of the knock on effects of the shutdowns and stimulus catchup with the market. but who knows at this point there is too much uncertainty for anyone to predict much of anything.Noob gamblers/stock-pickers on Robinhood watch a few Youtube videos that lead them to believe they'll be millionaires in no time, then have no ability to cope with seeing red.  It's hilarious.  I eagerly await the bursting of this bubble, because it'll crush the Robinhood crowd.You didn't see the post yesterday asking if a bomb went off?People are real retards.bro, ramen doesn’t grow on treesHaha me> The dow is down one half of one percent. Do people really start freaking out if stocks do anything but double every day?  

Even keeping in mind retail is only roughly 20% of the market. If this many people are panicky, that should have us all questioning just how strong of support 3,000-3,200 S&P500 really is. If people are panicking over 1-2% dips, whew. A 10% dip would have people running toward the exits.Haha yes. For those of us that aren’t here to earn $4 per MSFT share, this is the part where you sit back, buy the dip and reap the rewards in 5 years.Honestly this made me worried for a second lol. Expected to see a massive crash. Nothing out of the ordinary todayAs someone who very recently started, it does freak me out a little. Actually very reassuring to be told it’s normal and not because making a complete rookie mistake.The problem is most people are invested with no idea whether the price they've paid is of fair value, so they have no conviction when things get choppy. Reddit is home to the Nikola chasers and Genuis Brands Dumm dumbs.People are surprised that stocks can go downA lot more red ahead of us unfortunately....what a time to be alive. AMD carrying my portfolioThank you TSM and also basedgodStill holding my AMD I got at $2.46 when they announced the PS4 chip contracts....Wooooooooooooooo back babyIt's a mix of AMD actually doing good and what you said of Intel chip delay. Seems like the perfect storm for AMD to riseLol fuck that aint good news i sold it at like 55 thinking it was too slow ;-/Would've caught huge profit if only I had stuck to my strategy and held my shares since I had a feeling this would happen. By any chance do you believe earnings might also be priced in or will we see an even bigger move once they release?Goddammit I almost bought in at 58 yesyerdayWhat do you guys plan on doing? Holding or selling now to secure some profit and then buying back when it dips? Just want to gauge everyone's mindset on AMD. Thanks.what's a good price to sell it at? you think i'll be higher than intel or nvidia someday? should i hang onto it long term?Do as Barren Wuffett does: buy high, sell low.Hahaha love itin true r/wallstreetbets fashion, buy putsYou now speak like an award winnerThe award means you made the right decisionMe too!This broke boy added  2 more shares of Microsoft 8DWhat’s Monday? 
If I see red I pick up a couple to add to a new position.monday gonna be a huge green day, welcome to the kangaroo marketWhat dipI remember a lot of 17% shifts, not too many 7sHey guess who bought a couple MSFT instead of a couple AMD yesterday afternoon, after staring at both for a bitDamnnnnI made this exact play. Nice.I did the same with MicrosoftI feel you. I bought it at $390 thinking it was gonna keep going up with the new iPhone launch coming up..your good broIt's impossible to guess what the lowest low will be. You could have bought at the peak. I bought some netflix after their earning at 492 thinking it was bottomed out too.I bought this afternoon at 369.77. Looks like we're both down a few pennies on this purchase at the moment. I've been holding apple for a few years now. Just adding as we go. I wouldn't stress over the short term with this company.

Are you day trading or investing? 

If day trading: I hope it makes a sharp turn on Monday so you can make some cash.

If investing: What was your time horizon and investment thesis when you entered the position? Has that changed as of today?Never try to catch a falling knife or you will have blood on your handsLike how did these people survive march? 

Let me know when we're hitting breakers again.Must be sarcasmBruh I'm down 8% on AZN, down 11% on BCRX and down 4.69% on fucking SE. Yes, SE. What the hell is going on?As someone who only buys on red days and also got paid today..you’re not the only one celebrating Christmas in July :)I did the same. Finally sold some Tesla, not that I had a lot to begin with and bought all MSFT. Thought about getting ARKK too not enough love to go aroundSomeone on Reddit sold TSLA? Holy crap I'd better load up on puts! FOMO is over!

Edit: I don't know if I'm sarcastic or 100% serious, honestly.If you don’t mind me asking what do you plan to pick up? I’m new to the whole scene and was going to buy PLM a few days ago but didn’t and missed out.And seriously, NASDAQ 100 is down 0,69%. I don't see a reason for this post -- And I say this as someone whose biggest individual stock position still is INTC.Expiry?😅🤣😂🤣🤣New stimulus package might be approved Monday so today might be your dayDepends on what you are buying, and your overall buying trends. 

Could be a good time to get a slight sale, but I'm not buying any extra right now.

This drop is "significant" but most things have changed 5-10% at most, so it's not a huge deal.

It could drop a whole lot more, or shoot to the moon. Fuck if I know.Thinking the same. I don’t think today, trying to catch a falling knifeyou buy when the thing you want is at the price you want...VGTMaybe because the psychology that it will continue to go up or this is the top starts to enter peoples minds as soon as the price changes. Happens in extreme ways at market tops and bottoms directly after peak fear/fomo. 

Also if you want to make money then opportunity cost does make a difference. You could sit in cash which may do better over the next 20 months and not see your purchase drop 70% in value. But of course everyone who bought Tesla at 1700 already factored in the potential for a drop in price and weighted their position accordingly right? Right guys?I'm with you there. This is such a small dip specially when the markets have recovered to unwarranted levels. I wonder how the people panicking now would have reacted in March.Uh, the dollar sign goes before the numberCan we ban himWish I could, but My paycheck comes next Friday..I’m in the same boat.

Just waiting for wdc to do something... Anything... 

Really kicking myself for not selling off like $50k worth of wdc back when they were at $100/share and dumping that into amd ($12/share at that time) like I said I should. I'd be living a completely different life right now if I had followed my gut and did that. *sigh*Was looking for my fellow TSM believers.

I knew this day would come.Holding mine from $5.19 and wishing I bought more than 30 sharesSold all AMD and TSM way too early. Now they are up over 10%! Even XLNX is doing good.I just cashed out yesterday when it jumped to 64.50 in after hours...🤦‍♂️Hard to say with the way the market has been. 

Maybe they'll announce that they're developing a solar powered processor and they'll shoot up 500 percent next month. lol. 

I do think it has plenty of potential to go higher in the long-term. There still might be a pull back in the short term.All holding for me. I'm super long and bullish on it. I was buying it at a target price between 47-52. I might have to up that to buy at 55-60 but that's just me. I think it'll definitely be worth even more eventually.I wouldnt risk selling.  Atleast not until closer to Q2 earnings.I'm long on it. I believe it could easily go to 100 within the next year or two. I hope that Intel becomes an afterthought and they start focusing on taking more market share away from Nvidia. If they do that, who knows where it could go.

I bought Intel at $60 thinking it would go up but now it's 13% down at $50 a share.


Fuck.I did.I sold my AMD at 54 a couple days before the boom. Then thought about rebuying yesterday at 59, but bought MSFT at 202. It hurts. Had 600 shares of AMD.I bought one share AMD yesterday for 60. Big gains $$$Msft will be back up by end of next week. RemindMe! 7 daysJust lowering the average slowly. I'm fairly confident the stock price will ctne to drop, but as long as it does, I'll keep buying shares. Stocks like these will definitely rebound. Stay strongAnd I TeslaIsn’t it down due to the 11 being delayed? I’ve been holding AAPL since early 2012. I’ve seen it tank way worse than this. It’ll make you money, just don’t follow it everyday.You bought it within the last week and week bad that it isn't up yet?

Just depends on how fast/long!Yeah that 1% off sale really enticing.The opportunity cost of active trading your account vs holding index funds is monumental.

I spent all I could today and going to eat bake beans till I get paid next weekDelayed their next generation of chips.Referring to value, didn’t sell. This shit better rise or I just might have toSeems like the US and China both thumbing their noses, questions on when we see stimulus, and concern about the NASDAQ tech stocks.Personally I think the stock market is catching up with the economy so to speak. We’ve been through bad earnings and the market yawned, but now we are going to see lots more bankruptcies and small businesses going under. The business my wife works at is going under thanks to the second round of quarantines. Wouldn’t have happened if the supposed stimulus program went to small businesses rather than the Lakers and Kushner Cos, and if states hadn’t decided to reopen too early.Personally Im hedging cause of the unemployment bonus drop, China relations and no stimulus at least until Monday.  That's a trifecta of shit topping the cake from yesterday.

Swings gonna swing.What was the catalyst for the last 4 months of gains? Up until now, you had to look back a month to find back to back losing days on the S&P.China/US relations.  
Economic recovery is peetering out.  
Idiot robinhooders.Look at the charts, look at the numbers. If you’re a long-term investor there is nothing to worry aboutYes im in long term, but im new and dont have long term mentality.

I go on vacation for one week and the whole world has turned NKLA from darling to demon.Nope. Dollar cost averaging into NKLA because it’s one of those asymmetrical bets that can pay off in the future. However, don’t go head on and buy 1,000 shares. Buy a few at a time and see where it goes as it progresses.Agreed. This reasoning is why I believe TSLA will soon retest the $300 level, it's just not a good stock and its valuation is way overpriced.

Period.
















I have never thrown thousands of dollars into something without spending a great deal of time researching it. 










If someone can't even comprehend that they could lose 1% of their investment then they haven't even ever google'd what an investment is and should liquidate all their investments immediately. And then, never invest until they learn the literal basics.I don't think they were invested. And I do think these market highs frighten those who bought in recently with the prospect of a crash.I'm 15% in cash ($100,000), and long ETF's the rest ($600,000).

And the rest of us high-net-worth investors with dense portfolios will pick up the pieces at a discount.  I love it.They will keep driving up prices for a bit longer.

Barron Trump: free gameOwwwww

Hopefully they’ll turn it around though. I don’t want to see AMD get lazyGuess who bought a shit ton of Pfizer instead of AMD after staring at both and doing my DD 

This guy 🥺Honestly don’t kick yourself too much for that move. I think it will be back to $60 before too long. I might even go buy more now that it’s in sale. In fact, I’m going to go buy some intelHurts but hey, market gonna market. Better that we bought a couple instead of a couple hundredI've got a similar amount of shares. Been holding AMD for years with a $9 avg price. 

Struggling to find a good exit. Part of me wants to just sell half and see what happens with the rest.Oh yeah, it’s pretty much already come back. Just had a selloff or something in early minutesOuchAnd I Tesla Apple and Amazon...so much redStill higher than last month, and all of their businesses are doing well. Investing isn't a day-by-day play for most.Payroll tax holiday is NOT happening thoughTotally. With that mindset, when things drop, you can just get more of the things you like on sale.

Dollar cost averaging is boring but also somewhat foolproof.It’s an ETF.  They don’t have big swings.  And it’s down 5% from less than a week ago.Sure I agree if you are part of the DCA gang but many people over the past months are new lump sum investors that will get burnt.?what's the differenceThe difference is the result of subtracting one number from another.AfterThat’s not r/iamverysmart material though. I get your point but I think you may have missed the entire point of that subredditYoull be alright september 22nd is battery day. anyway  who is buying tesla for their cars(even tho they are really nice).. i ain't im in it for the world change that elon musk is bringing   :) and obv the bank account ill gain along the wayDcaMy family owns brick and mortar ice cream stores, we have about 5 stores. My dad has applied for assistance for about 5 loans. He’s only gotten a payroll loan... 

Government doesn’t give a fuck about small businesses. But guess what? My dad doesn’t give a fuck either then. He’s always open and since people aren’t going on vacations, we been doing very well, texas is one hot state. 

Sucks that a lot of small business are affected by the virus but at least my Dad is hanging on and tbh, sales have increased this summer compared to other years[deleted]Even if you're in long term, you can be smarter about the most extreme market volatility we've ever seen, by diversifying into defensive positions.

Diversify and hold, 2-5 years later put more back into the market.Keep your powder dry, it’s definitely happening sooner than later.

Just cahed in my 30 put options I bought when it was at 90 dollars. The strike was 70 and each costed almost 200 cad and had a month were they could be used.I didn’t believe the hype, so I refused to buy in. Although I’m really regretting that... I didn’t account for all of the other people buying in, and driving the price up. Coulda made some quick money off itTrue. I have 10 shares from before. It is sitting at a happy -$270 so far. Very hesitant to dollar cost average on this oneAnd you bet your ass I will be buying lolI wonder what Elon has to say on Twitter now holding his short shorts lolNo you’re a damn moronFollow the leader 😂They're in options or leveraged to the tits.And now they’re all invested in these crazy ass volatile stocks but still have no risk tolerance 

That’s why we get comments saying I lost 9k today, when the market was down  less than 1%. We know you don’t have $800,000 invested or a 1% drop wouldn’t be news to youNobody cares bro.Is it cause an investor handsome and wealthy?Down voted by robin hood usersThe discounts are what I'm here for!High-net-worth Investor you claim to be...LOl...you need to be humbled there little buddy!

Although their revenue is hecking high they continue to make shitty business decisions that keeps bringing them down.Thanks.in @$9... sell a portion to cover your initial investment, hold the rest as free money.You say that... with the same guarantee that I say "the 2nd stimulus is NOT happening" tho... neither of us ACTUALLY know.!was about to say the same thingGlad to hear that things are still running well with your dads business. Yup, the govt isn’t providing tailwinds like I thought and glad your dad has persevered.  A lot of small independent business are what make up the economy.If sales are up why is your dad applying for loan assistance?I'm being downvoted by the unemployed robinhood gamblers, lol.IPO  is a rigged game sadly, by the time its open to public its 200% up if the stock really is good enough.I'm not disagreeing whatsoever, it's just kinda ironic/funny. I go on vacation and it was sitting around $65, then today a buddy of mine tells me it fell down to $30. I had to confirm about 3 or 4 times. That's just an insane drop.

(I'm not holding any bags, but was keeping an eye on it prior to my vacation.)Average turnaround for companies take a long time. Tesla was sitting on $20-$40 per share for 3 years before breaking out to the $200’s for 6 years before going parabolic. They’re also a company who is very insolvent and ass in debt.Options as effective leverage?You mean like those people whose answer to everything is “buy Tesla”. Strangely, they seem quiet now. I own two Tesla shares and am glad I didn’t give in when it was surging prior to earnings call day.If you're a Robinhood gambler still buying shares, you'll care soon enough, friendo.That's fine.  Soon enough they'll be standing around with their dicks in their hands wondering what happened to their Robinhood "portfolios".Exactly. AMD is growing like crazy and taking advantage of the opportunity, and I really like what they’re doing. The worst thing that could happen is Intel continues being quite dumb, gives AMD a huge lead, and then AMD does the exact same as Intel and squanders their lead! Punctuation is important ? Don't know why anyone would think otherwiseYup, so true, and i think it doesn’t make much of a difference if my brokerage firm can get me in before trading day.Don’t you have internet during vacation or is that away from civilization type of vacation? Anyways, I want them to succeed too, I have 10 shares but still it’s a few hundred bucks in a hole alreadyWell, ya. That stock price was powered by pixie dust and rainbows. At $65 it’s got a market cap of over $20B. For a company that had $0 revenue and opex of $34MM last quarter, and no significant assets, and negative book value (for a manufacturing company, no es bueno), all the sudden investors just decide they don’t want to be a part of the charade any more and cash in those profits.Tesla was a business that had a real product. Nikola is hot air and pure speculation. It's a joke company that was pumped in order to wealth transfer from imbeciles to smart people. Don't confuse me with saying the company will never be a success, but the valuation it had and has is laughable.True, but how many of them can repeat the success story of TSLA? Nikola look like a cheap copycat. Also, their technology is questionable. So far photoshop pics and ambitious plans but they have to show even less than TSLA.Whatever it is, it’s risky and they don’t have the tolerance for it if they’re losing that much and panic selling.Yeah I think I'll call it quits with Intel after I get my money back and buy AMD.Ok well technically your second sentence shouldn’t have a question mark as it’s more of a declarationWell, if you are one of those lucky ones to get in before the IPO day then it will be a winning deal for most of the tech stocks.Not everyone is glued to stock prices on vacation lmaoFor the most part I was in the mountains and when I did get service, it was pretty sporadic. I'm more of a long term hold guy anyways so I made the decision to not try to waste my time or energy trying to get my TD app working up there hahaYes. At this point it’s basically a yolo stock for me. I do expect it to go to $0 at any time.Curious as to your thoughts on the video Nikola's CEO posted a few weeks ago.


https://youtu.be/7LSrvRMgIqwTheir website litterally seems like a scam.Not that many can, a company can merely try to imitate a Tesla and if they are half successful then I think they’ll still do mediocre, which was all I was expecting anyway.Their CEO posted a video of a fully operational fuel cell semi about a week ago. Just curious as to your guys' thoughts on that.

https://youtu.be/7LSrvRMgIqwI think there will be a rush for the exits, once the supply of suckers dries up.Yea I confused myself with my backwards grammarThe same way I wonder what do you guys think about this video saying that this technology is not feasible at the moment:

[https://youtu.be/hg-0LAirZPk](https://youtu.be/hg-0LAirZPk)Report posts that are low effort or break the rules. We remove them but it's hard to keep up, we are volunteers with jobs and families and can't spend all day here.

Automod and our mods catch a lot more than actually make it through to the sub, but it's impossible to have rules that catch everything without also accidentally removing a lot of solid posts with trigger words. We are currently removing dozens of shitty posts per day and dealing with the ensuing complaints of the users who posted them.

Tldr: report bad posts and downvote them, it helps more than making another post to complain.I’ve noticed this as well. I used to love this thread but over the past month you can tell it’s 99% newbies. Which isn’t a problem but it just no longer provides any substance or information that is worth the large amounts of time I usually spend on here. I’m not getting value like I used to. Over the past week I’ll find comments of people scolding or using condescending points that are completely factually wrong. But seem legit based on the confidence in which it’s written and no it isn’t sarcasm. It’s scary if you aren’t versed in enough knowledge to know what is BS and what isn’t. There’s always been BS on here but now it’s overwhelmingly so. But then again people should probably not trust reddit for their financial decisions in the first place.Don't forget the "i am 18 and have $5000. What stocks should i invest in?"Agreed. Wish there was a way to limit the amount of threads per stock. Seems like there has constantly been 1 or 2 NIO topics on the front page for weeks straight. Is that really necessary for a relatively small $10b company?I completely agree. I constantly see people making a post about asking how to start and any advice people have for them. All they have to do is type in the key words in the search bar and they get the endless posts of people asking the same question.Yeah, I miss reading some interesting DD posts on here. Content got pretty stale with the influx of noobs/wannabe daytradersCompletely agree.  I am tired of seeing posts like you mentioned or the S&P drops 2% and:

"Don't panic sell this is just a correction" or "The market has crashed should I buy this dip" or whatever other stupidity there is.

I used to pursues this sub pretty regularly but not anymore, I get little value and it's 90% "should I buy x" "is x overpriced" (where x is pretty much always TSLA)SNR here is awful. The most vocal crowd seems to be ignorant beginners who think they know it all because they blindly invested in March and rode the wave up. It's sad.We need to impose a character limit minimum on posts, otherwise we’ll continue seeing these “I have $100 AMD or Tesla?” shitpostsThe people who post about "bloodbaths" and stocks "plummeting" after going down like 2-3% are the fucking worst. Like jesus christ, stfu. Not to mention there was usually a giant run up right before it goes down...The only reason I stay subscribed is to revel in the tears when the bottom really drops out.I agreeI also see posts from straight beginners who don't know the difference between being short or long and asking for advice. It looks bad in the sub if a large minority (say 20%) of the subscribers are beginners not knowing what they're doing. You can find out more by reading. Be inquisitive. Use Google for godsakes.Hey,  I left the house for an hour and TSLA was down almost 5%,  not 1% like you said in your post.Sure, I mean remove all comments about Tesla or Microsoft just like N.IO and wk.HS.

It’s so incredibly difficult not to sort by new or popular comments.

C’mon: don’t be lazy and expect the world to change because r/stocks doesn’t have content that makes you personally happy.

Definitely the rest of the world’s problem that you can’t filter. Let’s just censor more. 

Perfect universal solution to an individual problem. 👌🏻

What you find “irritating” is not the world’s issue.

Most of the US market is controlled by 30 primary stocks. We gonna quit discussing them because you don’t wanna hear about them anymore?Sir, this is a Wendy's drive thruThis is /r/stocks, not /r/investing, but yeah... agreed. Hopefully mods see this post.I'm eagerly awaiting the next crash. I really don't want people to lose everything, but so many people are investing beyond their means and being far too risky because they've literally only have memories of a bull market.   I see time and time again on this subreddit that people are trying to help the new investors limit their risk and do their DD, but it's simply not sticking.  If you keep driving past all the warning signs and ignore them, there's not much anybody can do for you.I agree with what you’re saying the quality of posts has gone down , ‘ Hey I’m too lazy to do my own dd please tell me how to be rich ASAP thanks ‘ ...
maybe the mods need to modify the rules so we can weed out low quality posts with the auto mod upvote/downvote option . Works well on other subsSame, like yeah I’m gunna play AMD when it comes on down. But right now I’m investing in KO for some long term holds.Or implement robinhood level moderation where anything less that useful discussion gets shit on by the masses.its a bunch of 20  year old kids buying TSLA.   that's about it.

&#x200B;

The again, because of COVID, i have made some plays i NEVER would have normally and was successful.

&#x200B;

So even i made a post or two about Cruise lines before the rocketed to $26 range and crashed again.  i made a 100% gain and almost doubled all the cash i had to my name.

Never would have bought cruise-lines otherwise.  so the market crash is part of the reason so many dumb stocks are discussed here lately.Regrettably I'm one of the new guys but I've done my best to limit my posts to information that might be useful to *other people* as well as myself.

Not just spam "hOw dOes MY PorTFoliO LOoK?!"I agree. I'm new here and new to trading but so many posts, and specifically the ones you highlighted and made me question even being here. They'd pointless and silly. To the point where I'm asking myself if this sub is mostly 15yo's playing trader and commenting on every trivial thing out of excitimentIt's Reddit. It can't be taken seriously anyway. It's not going to turn into a serious discussion overnight.Why do you have 2 bring negativity when you finally do post?> Over the past couple of months though, since the market rebound, the quality of content here, in my opinion, has massively declined.

It is much easier to be thoughtful in a steady market. When the afflictions of mania, chaos, and uncertainty strike, I think it should be expected that the rags of the day mirror the same.

This is why it is so important, imo, to look at how you might act in moments of gnashed teeth. When the shit show comes to town, what sort of tickets are you going to have? Of course, you can't predict everything, but *the market* has a pretty binary state of UP or DOWN.You think that's bad, wait till the election heats up.You’ve been on Reddit long enough now to know all good subs eventually turn to shit.Thanks for writing this. I've also noticed the same. You also get brutally downvoted if you write anything critical about the "favorite" stocks. People aren't interested in reading longer write ups. Also a lot of "I have $1000, what should I buy?" threads (again, if you respond, "buy these and these books" you get downvoted).I'm a newbie only doing this since may, but I've already made mistakes and I'm currently in the red but I'm ok with it and feel like I'm in this long term.

For others that are new but can't deal with being in the red maybe they will give it up and leave soon after realising that actually stonks don't always go up.Then unsub or keep scrolling. No one is forcing you to be here. You really think complaining about it is going to change anything? Or did you just make this thread for fake internet points? Get off reddit and go for a walk.No one ever blames the Users who upvote the bad stuff to Hot. Can't stick it all on volunteer modsOn another note, what if we had username flares connotating our self-assigned experience or years of trading experience?

That way we could easily discriminate! I mean, evaluate and sympathize!Apologies if this seems like a rant at the mods - it’s not supposed to be. My point was rather that from the rules it’s not really clear that shitty posts aren’t allowed? 

I appreciate all the work that the mods are continuing to do in this time of growth in popularity of the sub!I have also experienced bullying if you state your honest opinion about stocks that are overvalued. I have been called "Idiot" and "Retard". I reported the comments but they are not deleted. If anyone is posting a cautionary opinions on stock that are being promoted here and then getting insulted, then what kind of quality discussion one can expect?EhhI’m in agreement on all points. So what should we do about it?I agree I've noticed the same thing. It's kinda sad tbh.I'm a newbie and I can also tellI’m 12 and have $1.34, which stocks do I buy?Hopefully this will change when unemployment fallsI mean I feel that one is okay because the person came here to learn to some degree right. They probably have no mentor to teach them. Let's not roll all posts together as the same.My favorite question yesterday was “Should I dump MSFT?”I was going to do a big write up on the fintechs and my theory on how they will perform in the coming years, but frankly im not sure how valuable the responses on here are going to be. Ive already done most of the research I would just need to set a couple of hours aside to do the write up, but it feels out of place given the types of threads I see.SNR?Yeah, I feel like there is actually like no good subreddit for good read ups these days. It is all just crowded with the top 10 traded stocks.We have one and have been discussing increasing it lately.Ah yes. Apologies, have edited.Exactly. One young guy reached out to me and I’ve provided him some advice in a few personal messages.  So as a fairly experienced investor I’m glad I could at least impact one person. Those 90% of people will get smacked with reality at some point.Well, they are also focusing on the companies that have the best gains over the past 3 months, and just automatically assume that keeps upWhat election?This is a big thing too, the posts are on the front page of the sub because people are upvoting them.It's been discussed but no way to verify without a ton of extra effort on mods. And if self assigned it's really just a joke as anyone can say they have 10 years experienceWe are rewriting rules and should be out shortly. Simplified them as we found people just weren't reading them at all. Low effort is definitely something we remove as much as possible, unless it gets good discussion in comments in which case we may leave up.Spend less time on Reddit unfortunately 🤣Prevent accounts that haven't been subscribed to this subreddit for at least a year from making new threads.I’m a fetus and have $100 in gift cards - what STONKs can I buy?I'm just saying not to forget those posts since he was categorizing all the posts. Those kinds of posts are indeed welcome but after you see a few of those everyday you get tired of replyingI don't mind those, since, if they gotta ask, the answer must always be yes. I suspect they're buyers high, sellers low, and so yes, always yes, turn that paper loss into a real one.Honestly, even if it's mostly BS responses, there are still plenty of people who read the information and get value from it without ever leaving a comment (like me).I'd be interested in reading it! Hopefully readers can downvote the useless responses and upvote the thought-provoking ones.Never comment myself but will read it.Yeah, I get what you're saying. I didn't mind posting DD when looking into companies I was considering investing in, but to format it to look good on reddit and do all the little stuff always took a little extra time, and I felt like as of late it'd be drowned out in all the low effort posts.signal to noise ratioYeah, if there is one, I haven't found it either.Please do! And perhaps require a ticker symbol in the submission to prevent vague, general questions about investingPlease do.Suggestion: I don't see a rule clarifying what kind of posts belong in the daily discussion thread. I use a "Belongs in megathread" rule in my sub so people can report and flag posts that should be removed and moved to the announcement megathreads. You'd *think* people would read the rules and announcement threads before posting but most people, especially new sub members, do not. 

There's enough users here that they should be able to help the mods out with identifying some of those posts.

*edit spellingTrue, but you could just have things like "beginner" - "novice" - "some experience" "experienced" "expert" "pro" kind of thing.

Not so that people can self label as pros, because you're right at least 5% of them would just be catfishing, but I think at least then as you're scrolling you can filter out posts by self-identified beginners.

At the same time I don't really care though so either way 💁

Ohhhh I just thought of something! What if you made flares for your brokerage? See where I'm going with this? 😉2nd thisI’m a 2 year old in potty training and I have a nickel to invest - where can I get low risk 400% returns by Wednesday?True. Is there a wiki page for here that automod could auto-reply with?But what good does that do him?Why would you use such an esoteric abbreviation instead of just typing it out?Good ideaWe try to be brokerage agnostic and don't want any brokerages to be getting traction from our sub. Could see webull or Robinhood sending spam users in with their flair to increase.

Self identifying isn't really an option here bc of the possibility of catfishing as you said, and folks calling themselves pros to then try to sell their advice, or push pump and dumps.  Mod verification is the only way we'd be comfortable with it to stop users from being preyed on and fall victim to pump n dumps from "pro" users, but we don't have the manpower to verify users in quantityInvest in POO, IN, and TLT and I'll give you a quarter.Teaching is the best way to learn
. But other than that nothing lolMeh, I'm an engineer, it's a common abbreviation. I don't always remember that what's common for me isn't common for everyone before I type something.SNR is pretty common vocab for anyone stats/eng/cs/analysisMan you're thinking about this whole thing a lot more than I was.

I guess that's what mods are for though... All good points

Can we at least get favorite stock flares or something?

Favorite candy?Deal
  
  
Edit : fuck i missedIronically, by using crappy abbreviations like SNR you are contributing to the noise.It's kind of a useful description of a sub actuallyYour getting alot of heat for using an abbreviation people may not know which makes no sense to me, but also gives an interesting view onto why the state of this sub has deteriorated so much.

Instead of people being curious and interested in learning something new, they are angry they didnt have the answers handed to them.Also candy would be sweet but starbursts or gtfoLol yeah sorry it's been brought up before and we've discussed but can't find a good way to work it. I'm thinking of addressing again, a self flair more around like day traders, long term investors, swing traders etc. To identify trading styleJesus. Go take a stats class or something. Maybe it's your level of education that's the problem. Even the marketing wanks I've worked with over the years understand it./r/snrequalszeroRight? I'd use the fuck out of it to evaluate subsHey that would be a really cool way to add context to people's posts! I like it!I thought you were referring to a ticker symbol."I'm in a field that .05% of people are in"
  
"MaYbE iTs YoUr EdUmAcAtIoN"You sound fun at partiesDon’t be a cuntI get it, SNR = Zero because there is nobody in that's sub! Brilliant.I am! Super fun. I'm a happy drunk.Too lateMaybe you should stick partying then..that would be 13% gain, very safe and promising with good growth rate. cant loseI keep telling people **MICROSOFT IS THE GREATEST COMPANY IN THE WORLD**. If I had to YOLO my life savings on one stock for the next 30 years it would be MSFT. The diversification of revenue, the management, the importance of AI and cloud mean MSFT will be the greatest investment in big cap tech over the next 50 years. Short at your peril, because MSFT will outperform all of big cap tech, AMZ may get close but the others aint got a chance.Can't agree with you more.Arrived a little late to the party. Started building a position a couple weeks ago. Yesterday hurt but I bought a little more on the dip and have a $205 average. Long hold for me so if it drops more I’ll buy more.I bought some yesterdayWhen everyone says buy....Great company but I feel like there will be better buying opportunities down the road. I don’t think a 13% increase in profits justifies a 50% increase in share price.>The growth drivers remain strong. 

One worrisome item was that Azure, their prime growth sector, lagged last quarter in terms of growth.

>And the valuation on MSFT stock remains tangible relative to the company’s long-term growth prospects. 

Depends on your valuation method. Mine has them at a fair value of ~177 with a 10% margin of safety. Doesn't mean that's "right", but it's what I tend to use. I have a position in MSFT and added a bit today at 198, so I'm willing to bend my rules sometimes, but I wouldn't say it's clear cut that their trading at fair value right now.

>No way this does not hit $230 in the next few months.

Never be that confident.Well, I wouldn't mind but I could go for a bit of a pullback to load in 10 more shares first.Microsoft is always a buy.Jumped out of Apple to hop into MicrosoftBought a bunch today.BUY BUY BUY!!Bought some as well i think xbox series x launch will be better than xbox one and everything else everyone said might buy some more monday or TuesdayMsft is one of the largest holdings in my portfolio. This company is in numerous different industries and still highly favored amongst institutions that utilize their products and services.. I'm always adding more and more shares of this stockI was all set to buy 5K at $200...but then Intel shares dropped 15%. Couldn't turn down that bargain.I bought 205c for October. It looked like to be about the most sure thing available. No way these things don’t print.Please buy the dip. 

Buy the dip 
Save my call spread.Already got a lotDefinitely. Microsoft is a good company. Watch this! [Best performing stocks ](https://youtu.be/BOsxgKk2tXY)I lost today about -$850 on MSFT credit spreads as market went down. I agree it’s a good opportunity to buy low but no more funds left for that. This will probably make me sound dumb, I’m a beginner and have been trying to learn as I go but I still do not fully understand MSFT and why it’s at the price it is given everything everyone says about it.When they stop the additional $600 a month in unemployment in July, and we enter the 2nd wave of the virus, will this affect the numbers too? People can't buy if people don't have jobs? Unless the printers keep burring?Yes everyone please buy msft. Pleeease!Better yet sell short strangles on MSFTYou just don’t want it to tank...Tell yourself whatever..Bought 10k before earning, still holding.Very confident with Msft!  When they dip I never worry. Holding 100 sharesI've been holding MSFT since 2004, I bought 125 shares at just under $30.  I've had it DRIP since 2011.  I'm up 480% overall.  The best of my initial purchases is up 645%.As someone who is up 2 million for the year, despite the virus selloff, Microsoft is too boring for me. I’ve done some option spreads but otherwise this is something you buy in retirement coz you can’t sit and watch the markets as you are shaking your dick for 40 minutes to drain every drop of peeWhat About Slack making allegations towards Microsoft for illegal activities, Going under an EU review?One of the first stocks I bought when I was able to do so myself. So many things, and I don't get the hit from the earning call. (I do but don't think it's warranted.) I see the decline in cloud from the closure of so many businesses and the new barrier owners must hurdle getting a company going in this economy. But the fact azure FOR THE 1ST TIME grew sub 50% and they still blew past expectations shows a wide most that still supports the business. I see 250$ by year end. I'm long MSFT thoughIf we're talking long-term, don't forget also that MSFT actually pays dividends, unlike some of the other tech big boys.  Building an income stream can be a huge difference if you're truly looking long-term.I would take TSLA over MSFT. If anyone wanna wager who get better return in 10 years, let me know.Just goes to show how important leadership is. Microsoft was pretty irrelevant under Balmer for most of 2000s up until Satya came in an shook things up by deciding to focus on cloud.

Kinda see the same thing happening with Intel now only in reverse. 

The problem with owning a single stock for 30 years is that you never know which way company culture will go long-term. Things might seem good now but might not be in the future. That's why diversification is always bestYou should never YOLO your savings on one stock, even if it is MSFT. 

But I agree, MSFT is the king of stocks going forward.What you're saying is essentially cheerleading. But all that is subject to change, so check your emotions when you invest. 

(Not saying you're wrong...)It’s not just a single company too. It’s pretty much 100s if companies that’s diversified in many sectors of tech. AMZN is cool too, but threat of anti-trust is much largerMicrosoft charges so damn much for their corporate software licenses, and it’s getting worse. All it takes is a shift in software (Word, Excel, etc) in the future with a new generation of younger people that support open-source options, and Microsoft becomes non-existent.Not as good as $AMZN Amazon is every where where msft is in cloud where msft is not everywhere amzn is - self driving car, robots, retail, delivery supply chain and logistics 

$Amzn is far superiorIdk if you guys are bots or not. 

Apple has gone up ~60% since March, Tesla has gone up ~399% since March.

Microsoft has only gone up ~47%

To me Microsoft sure as hell is definitely not the best company to invest your life savings in if you actually want to make money.Agreed but is this place represents everyone ?Down the road... When exactly? When coronavirus is no longer a thing after the US election?Love to know your valuation method that has them at 177... somethings wrong with it. Do you take into account an inflated market? Surely if your valuation on Microsoft is that low it’s low on all stocks like itYou seem like you know what you’re talking about. What else you holding?

Edit; what made you break rules for msft?Azure lagged because of the global depression we are in, without corona it would be growing 55%+Yeah... If the whole market moves, who knows where the bottom is. Broad market forces are powerful pricing mechanisms. 

But, that’s why dollar cost averaging is a beautiful thing. If the market goes down, just buy more. 

I’m about 25% cash right now. May pick up some MSFT on Monday, especially if it dips any more.It was down to $197 earlier today. Just out of curiosity, what PT do you have as a buy-in price?You risk missing out on a run to save potentially $10-30?I just saw this posted, unsure about the veracity.  But makes me wonder if it matters which you pick.

https://imgur.com/0mAtNuDI'm with you.  This time last year the stock was $140 when everything was sunshine and kittens.  Now the world starts to end and its $200?Long term does not matter, companies make allegations all the time.What's a slack lol? I don't even know what they do or why they even exist when I can utilize msft teams for whatever reason slack thinks it can outperform msft atBuying both.Well we have satya for 10 years and I hope he appoints someone competent, so we have a solid 20 years for sure. After that, I don't know.I think balmer used to sell calls at 40$50% JNJ, 50% MSFT. Sprinkle dividends into SPAQ.You forgot TSLA. I even sold my kids to buy more. Who needs them? I can just make more, right?The problem with changing software is it's super fucking sticky. Once you build on it unraveling is near impossible. So you're stuck with what you got. Especially when your talking about base infastructure like ERP or CRM.People have said that since 1985.  Microsoft built everything off DOS.  It still lays underneath almost every computer system on Earth.  People and business use them, not because they are always the best, but that's what everybody else uses so you can only swim upstream so long before you just go with the tide.I think Google is a good hedge with Microsoft for this reason. They have the potential to really disrupt some of Microsoft's largest revenue streams with things like a more polished Google Suite or expanded Chrome OS. That being said, Microsoft is still fairly well-diversified, other than Amazon, no other tech company I can think of comes close. While Google poses a threat to Microsoft, a mass spread of free adblockers could wreak havoc on Google's golden goose overnight.Talks of life savings, only looks back 4 months.

LOL.lolTesla is a bubble, the other two are not.🤨Idk if you are a troll or not.Then in your opinion what’s the best company to invest in? TSLA?Only cuz the robinhoods know what apple and Tesla are.No it's the most elite of retail traders who know what the other minnows don'tOnce the financials start catching up to the share price. It’s currently at 11x sales which I feel is very high for a company as big as Microsoft. Could be a year from now, could be 3 years from now, could be never. I get that it’s a fantastic company but historically all of its valuation metrics are higher than ever. At its current market cap it’s not a stock that’s gonna grow 15%+ indefinitely so I’m okay with putting my money in other places until there’s a better opportunity.It's a pretty simple DCF. Getting the assumptions about growth right is the tricky bit. 

 Like you said, doesn't provide much opportunity in tech, especially right now, which is why I broke my own rule. Was great in March though.I like msft quite a bit, have been investing in them for since they started embracing open source and Linux. We'll see how it works out, but I feel I have a bit more room for error with them than most. It's also tough to hit buy points using a DCF with tech companies. I scooped up a ton in March.Before earnings the everyone was saying that COVID will benefit Azure because of the increase in WFH and need for remote tech. Interesting to see how the narrative has changed.I likely got my starter position at 200 something based off what happened during the opening few minutes.

I'd prefer at least 180 really to lump sum, but I'm looking to add 10 more shares to have 20 for more exposure to the cloud for me.You’re extremely closed minded by this statement my friend. Look beyond the pandemic and what they are going to evolve the world into.It's a business communication platformWhy JNJ?The same could be said about any tech growth stock.Madness to bet against MSFT, COVID is short term, in 20 years AI and cloud computing will be lead by MSFT.My understanding was always that businesses wouldn't approve new contracts during the pandemic while they scrambled just to convert their staff to WFH via existing systems, but it served as a strong catalyst for the approval of future integrations. It's possible this is priced into the share price to a degree, but I think the actual COVID upswing is totally unreflected in the recent quarter's earnings.It did in other respects (teams and gaming). Companies are not eager to take on huge cloud contracts atm during the pandemic. Cloud is still relatively young.MSFT gifted out teams and azure growth was slowed in part due to the fact the physical data centres were at capacity. Due to the massive amount of cores spun up for teams. New azure subscriptions and core requests were getting restricted to health care. 

Teams is sticky nobody will be rolling it back, it will lead to to more Premium azure ad licences long term and cross selling opportunities.$180 ain’t happening lolMy point exactly lol... I work in finance and tech.. I've never seen anyone mention slack too communicate anything over their platform it's always a msft product.. 

So that should tell you how mighty msft isWhich is why I’m not holding too much mega-cap tech right now. I’m being very selective with the tech I hold because I feel much of it is overvalued. But I can see why people like Microsoft.I think all that is true, I also think much of that is priced into the stock already.Maybe not anytime soon, but you can't pull it off the table entirely unless you're in fantasy land where you don't think another correction is possible (sadly that's going to most likely be wrong). 

If it doesn't I'll most likely be happy with holding 10-20 shares as more exposure to the cloud.Tech is the future. It isn't going anywhere..

We will literally be human cyborgs in another 100 years lol. (I'm kidding of course, but at the same time not really).

We are so integrated with technology and it has only just begun. I like investing in companies at the forefront of that innovation. Microsoft is the type of company to invent something that shifts generations. They've done it before and they will do it again.I agree with that. The thing is is that everyone in entire world agrees with that and is buying Microsoft accordingly. Will Microsoft be a strong and innovative company for the next 10 years? Yes. Will its stock outperform the market in that same period? I’m not sure. People were saying the same thing about Microsoft in 2000, and in fact they were totally correct. But Microsoft still underperformed the market in the period up until about 2016. Believe me, it’s a company I’d love to own, but its strong run-up this year isn’t sustainable long term.No one is arguing that these big tech companies will continue to do well. The question is whether they are fairly priced right now.You should go with an index fund. Significantly lower fees.

Here's a blog if you don't believe me. The guy is solid.

Best of luck.

https://jlcollinsnh.com/stock-series/[deleted]Better off with FNCMX. Very low expense ratio.You want them gambling with you’re moneyIndex funds are typically optimized with a good risk reward ratio, have less paperwork in tax season and are beat many fund managers in the long term.

I was in mostly index funds, but Covid left clear winners and losers that were not reflected in the averages. I switched to all equities. I am looking to get back into index funds, now that the market is close evenly priced again.I voted you up. This is the best investment solution I read all day. Good luck.

All the best.I'd rather gamble with my money than have somebody else (the mutual fund portfolio manager) gamble with my money.

If you want something completely passive then you would probably be better off with just a boring index fund of the S&P 500 over a mutual fund.Since you’re on fidelity I would look into these. FXAIX, FTEC, FUTYI think this is a good idea but you should still take a small sliver (<$500) for active investing because some opportunities are obvious and worth taking advantage of in the momentyet he goes all tech... lmao.What’s the difference between index and mutualWhy are you always spamming this blogIt's not get rich. It's build wealth.

Quite a difference.Haha thanksThat’s a third of my portfolio. I’m only 18 and have only saved up a small amount so farFeesIndex funds *generally* are spread across the entire index, but that’s not universally true and most commercial mutual funds are diversified enough that there’s no practical difference. Except, well, the fees lol.I'm not spamming it 

I'm telling people how they should invest.

Why should I spend 20 minutes writing a post to educate the uniformed about index funds when I can link to a blog where the person knows what they are talking about and has spent years writing about it?Put your $$ in the SPY500 on dips.  Reinvest dividends.  Buy regularly at least monthly or quarterly.  Put this on auto pilot.  Just DO it.  Here's the important part.  Spend LESS than you make.  Good Luck[deleted]This.

Now read the blog.

(Thanks for answering their Question)Why would I not. the point of this subreddit is to talk about what we are doing with our moneu[deleted]I said what I did. People gave their opinions and I learned from them. That’s a discussion. And you’re an asshole[deleted]The point of OP’s post stands whether or not they are investing $1 or $1m.

OP is correct, you’re an asshole.You're the reason there's a bunch of meta posts about the state of this sub lol.Then unsubscribe.Or we can ask more of each other for quality content over shit posts.
  
  
Your comment is basically "if you don't like the country then leave" tier nonsense.AMD up 14% and INTC down 14%, what  a dayAMD is single handily making my portfolio green today. Them and LULU are the only things positive for me and I’m up a ton today (about 1.2% positive)Both AMD and TSM Today. Intel missed earnings and said it's delaying at least 6 months their 7nm chip. They were down like 18% last time I checked.

So, people are picking AMD as the current winner and growth potential, and TSM is likely the manufacturer to help Intel do their 7 nm chips, they already work with AMD and Apple.  That, and Apple moving to their chip design, using TSM,  and how much support the tech community is giving to AMD, how much shit Intel has been taking from them as well is the right equation, for now.  Intel led for so long it looks like they have been taking a nap.

I'm so happy I didn't give up on my AMD and TSM shares all this time.I sold half my AMD holdings when the stock hit 62. up 170% from the share price I bought in at. When everything else was red in my portfolio. 
I just wanted to make sure I had some profit from it. I'm excited to see where AMD goes.Do you guys think there will be a dip after earnings? I wanna increase my holdings in AMD, I hadn't bought a lot since I have NVDA tooand here I sold amd two days ago because it wasn't moving.$66 was likely the limit here but what do I know. Got out of some Leaps at a profitYesterday would of been a good day to buy a call lolI should've never sold any of the shares I bought in when it was at $52Sold at 68.7. will probably buy back in at the next pullback.Damn up over 11% todayINTC falling hard right nowSounds like a little rebalancing may be in orderIf you've been holding amd shares for the last year we are winning right now! I hate that I sold my $55 call that exp next week but still holding my 60 and 65sold my 60C @ 400%
 
I didnt want to lose it like I lost out on AAPL. it was up as much as 450% two-three weeks ago. now it's down some 70%KThe whole market is tanking, so don’t worry about this specific stock. AMD is a good company. Watch this! [Best performing stocks ](https://youtu.be/BOsxgKk2tXY)Perfectly balancedYou must have a lot of AMD and Lulu then.Thanks for this info. TSM wasn't on my radar at all but ill keep a close eye on them as well.I'm wondering if it's too late to buy shares of AMD now. Thinking of adding shares to my Roth.MU over here dropping.*INTC beat earnings by a bit but lowered future guidanceSame thing here. Sold half today at 67.Why sell a 100$ stock?I’m up in the air on it think that even if they miss expectations their forward guidance will be strong with this news of Intel along with the new consoles coming out later this year using their chips.It was exactly 69 when I checked and I was like "haha funny sex number should check reddit"Haha ya, the upward trajectory stopped just as I finished making this post. Oh well, set the trailing stop loss for today anyway. If it hits then thats that.Last I checked some are up 9600% since yesterday, absolutely bonkersI bought my first shares about 10 months ago at $31.93 share. Bought some more in June at almost $54. My only regret is that I didn't have more money back at $32/share to buy even more.I sold at $52 and I deeply regret it.I hope there will be another one because I want to get back in too.Honestly, I think the Intel drop is a huge over reaction. Give it a week and they should start steadily climbing again. I probably going to move my AMD gains over into Intel when AMD starts its inevitable pullback and then just go back and forth.Ive got weak hands too. Sold at $69 because I got scared and seems to be holding throughout the day. I may just jump back on Monday after the morning dips. At least profits are locked and I can play the wait and see game.. . . [as all things should be](https://youtu.be/Vx5prDjKAcw)Yea...my biggest two holdings(due to their growth though). They combine for around 25% of my portfolio. Because of them I ended up 1.7% today with just those two as my green holdings with everything else redDo you know the reasoning for MU falling?Why not? Honest question.yeah reddit simps think a number matters more than company fundamentalsCould be like Microsoft where they hit their expectations and plummet anyway lol.I have screenshots of nvidia at 420 and amd at 69. Gonna frame them.Yeah I don't believe INTC should be down 16% today, but what do I knowI've just done exactly this.Same idea here brotherAs all things [are](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/016/212/manning.png)Not a clue. Should be fine long term.People's expectations are too high.I wouldn’t doubt it either just gives a price to buy in at thenI’ve got a screenshot of that sweet sweet Nvidia “$420.69” price pointAlways have beenI agree. I am not really worried. Just was curious cause I dont really see the connection that would reflect badly on MU.Neither do I. Could just be people selling and going over to TSM and AMD since they are going up?Buy the run up, sell to the gamblers right before100% in  agreements.Great post. I just want to add that if you really want to beat the big boys, Wall Street does have certain blind spots. A retail investor is more likely to “win” a trade where the typical data sources you outlined are unavailable or unreliable. That’s why Wall Street seems so clueless when a company has no real competitors (like Tesla), no real supply chain (like Amazon or Microsoft) or breaks away from prior strategies and business operations (like AMD and Apple). Notice the pattern?

The best chance to beat the kings is to focus on those companies that require an outside the box perspective, and more qualitative analysis. 

I’m not saying to just immediately buy those companies, I’m just saying that’s the area where the professionals are most likely to be incorrect.But I am still gonna bet on apple and amazon, I don't believe they will all drop after earning like msft.It’s not that the price action is wrong, it’s that people don’t know what big money care about. Saying something bear earnings is meaninglessLet’s be fair, you have no idea if this is profit taking or a bubble popping. 

It’s still up 40% in a month...let’s not discount the bubble theory just yetHow come you can tell the future and I can't? That's so not fair...I'll buy in at $250Can anyone justify the value of the share/company? 

I love Tesla, but they dont seem to be producing enough cars/profit to be the largest automaker by market cap. 

I think a reasonable price is somewhere around $700-$1000/share. 

Looking for info, not arguments.I'm not a professional charter by any means, but this looks like a classic double top and we're well below the support line at 1500.Niche luxury automaker worth $1700 a share based on future tech promises that don't exist yet. Definitely not a bubble at all. People should be very very wary of a stock the destroys earnings the way tesla did and then drops almost 10%. Their earnings showed a significant decline in demand for preorders that was not the fault of the pandemic. Their profit was so large because the majority of their labor force was on unemployment for most of the quarter.Tesla is worth around 264b right now.  Its P/E ratio is over 700.  Toyota's P/E is less than 10.  Tesla may very well be the next big thing if it doesn't hit any competition, but its effective market valuation is literally 18 trillion when compared to other automakers, bigger than the DOW itself.  The global car market isn't even that big.

(of course take this with a grain of salt, its P/E ratio is so low because its margin/car is low - for now, but its stock definately does not reflect the company value or even market conditions)Holding and adding more, I expect it will drop quite a bit more before surging again.Its to volatile for me to keep for long but I cant deny that the swings between $1400-$1600 have been very good for day trades.Bubble!!!If this dip below 1k, maybe that is the real buy in chance.I don't own any shares either. Definitely buy the dip everyone. I'll take the discounts on better stocks.Tesla also cooked their Q2 books.

Tesla = EnronThis. Finally someone is making some sense. I’ve been lurking around these forums and everyone is overly optimistic. None of us have an idea of what’s going on. History tells us that we are headed towards a market crash but that does not seem to be the case (yet). I expect everything to go to shit really soon.yeah 40% growth in the biggest reccession in a century, something makes no sense at all...100% its a bubble.Use that money to buy glasses (;I'd be shocked if it ever fell below $500 a share again, there's just too much long term strength in TSLA & belief in the company for it to sink that low again.https://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2020/01/an-ode-to-luck-revisiting-my-tesla.html

This professor is called dean of valuation and has appeared numerous times in CNBC. He values Tesla at ~$500.I stay away from buying TSLA. I also like the company but its value on the stock market is just ridiculous. 

They might become the leader in the future but for now I don't see a justification why I should spend more than 1000$/share and yeah, I know it is about predicting the future value of a company but there are just way too many uncertainties Tesla has to face the next years.Look up “meet Kevin”’s recent tsla video on YouTube right after their earnings in which he breaks down projected numbers a few years out in which he quantitatively justifies the price, if you want to see a level headed buyer who actually knows the market more than random tsla Hypies like myself lolAnyone who knows the fundamentals of this company can justify the value, the problem is that it's an incredibly complex company to understand and as long as a lot of people don't and wall street keeps letting automotive analysts instead of a team of , it's gonna be difficult for them to stay at these levels.

No offence, but your comment is the perfect example. Saying something like "they don't produce enough cars for this kind of market cap" when talking about a company that is about to completely disrupt energy, freight and ride-sharing industries while introducing software-level margins into the automotive industry with a ridiculous market share sounds incredibly stupid.I think $1400 is a fair price. $700+ if there’s a major crash to the whole market.What does that mean? More cratering expected? Consolidation? Mooning?ThEy ArE NoT aUtOmAkEr!!yOur SCiEnCE iS FlaWEd mR. maNDude they lowered the price on their cars and will continu to do so becouse they still feel like its to expensive for allot of people. It has nothing to do with a demand problem they are not like any other company who like to see massive quarter profits. They want to continue building more and more giga factorys and keep selling more of them they wont have a massive quarter profit but rather just like this one just 100mill gaap profit it could be so much more if they didnt invest continously in new innovations. Btw did you even listen to there earnings call? Checking spreadsheets how this one compared with other quarters?  There automotive sales were 5,132,000,000 Q1 2020 5,179,000,000 Q2 2020How much down would you even consider buying?
I am a new investor so curiousAre you talking about that they report in non gap?Every crash has a recovery, question is can you HODL & DCA? Not everyone can.Agree. Got to look left and find support with trend lines and then price resistance when a trend is broke. Many stocks do no have anything to the left as of late and resistance is a huge drop. I saw aapl break the bottom trend line yesterday and it kept going. I thought it was going to 360 before yesterday's close. It finally made that mark some point today even though it reboundedAt $500 Tesla's P/E with current profits would still be about ~250. They still have a long way to go and when Ford, VAG and other big manufacturers in a couple of years enter the market they at the moment dominate, Tesla better be ready to compete.The financial fundamentals have to eventually match the stock price otherwise eventually people will tire of their performance. Tesla would need to sell more cars than Ford and GM combined at the moment to do that. Or alternately they will have to raise their price significantly to increase profits.Cool! I'll check him out, thanksCan you explain the fundamentals then?

How are they going to "completely disrupt energy"? 

Has congress decided that completely autonomous vehicles are allowed to operate on all roads? 

Has the liability issue of autonomous vehicles been settled?

You're selling me "hype" but youre not telling me why that hype is deserved.Being certain that they will "completely disrupt energy, freight and ride-sharing industries while introducing software-level margins into the automotive industry with a ridiculous market share" sounds stupid too, they're not even in the lead for developing autonomous vehiclesThis \^  


Also i like to mention all there patents on Batteries who gonna be in all cars in like 10-15 years when all have changed from Diesel/gas to Green energy.>talking about a company that is about to completely disrupt energy, freight and ride-sharing industries while introducing software-level margins into the automotive industry with a ridiculous market share

Tell me in numbers? what are assumptions?Buy it as much as you can right now! it is trading at its fair price.It's generally a very bearish indicator that precedes a sharp drop near term.Can't tell if serious or not. :fry_squint.gif:Yeah Tesla hates profit, I agree.Lowering their price will destroy their profits.Well this comment proves my point for me. ThanksHonestly, I have no idea. People who study this stuff all the time say between 500 and 2000. The average seems to be 1000. It also depends on what you want out of investing. If you want to make a huge profit, that's going to come with more risks and if that's the case, wait til under 1000 and pray that it goes back up. If you want to invest in the company because you like what they do, just invest whenever because you believe in the company. You'll probably lose money short term but will gain money long term. If you just want to make money, I'd avoid a stock like TSLA until Price/Earnings comes more in line with car companies (obviously it'll be a little higher, but it's way out hand). If you are new investor, keep an eye on stocks you like to learn their trends, and by a total stock index fund in the mean time, since the odds of you beating the market on your own is extremely low. 

You should also know that the market in general is insanely overvalued when comparing historical price/earnings of the entire market. On top of that income disparity is growing, and housing is at all time highs on costs while wages remain stagnant. On top of that the us currency is being devalued by a lot of this stimulus (which is necessary and I think a very good thing, but is bad for investing). I think investing in the stock market with a healthy ratio of bonds to stocks, is a good idea, but you should be aware that the market looks extremely scary right now. It could keep going up 20% or it could plummet 40% in a week, it's hard to know. Last bit of advice, this sub doesn't like it usually, but diversify outside of the stock market. Probably want to keep at least 10% of your investments in things other than public equities since it's tied to a single place. I can't discuss some of them here because it's banned, but just keep it in mind.I’d consider buying at $700. I’d definitely buy at $500 but idk if it’ll ever get there. Would take another lockdown basically and the whole market crashing, and California closing their Fremont factory to happen, which doesn’t seem likely right now.Personally I will wait until it drops to $1000. Even thought I don't think it worths $1000 but I will definitely jump into TSLA since I don't want to miss out the $500 to $1700 train again.Is it better to HODL while it drops 50% or to sell right before the crash and buy the dip?Lol, don’t worry, we’ll be ready!> Can you explain the fundamentals then?

It's a bit too complex to just try to explain in a few sentences or even paragraphs. If you really want to try to understand I suggest watching the Youtube channels Hyperchange and/or Solving The Money Problem (provided this one is a bit too biased perhaps), they do a much better job at explaining than I ever could.

> How are they going to "completely disrupt energy"?

The short story is that they're now offering the cheapest solar power in the US, a unique storage option in the Powerwall and their Autobidder program that will allow people to earn money by delivering energy stored in their Powerwall and/or vehicle to the grid. If successful, it could move energy production/distribution from energy companies to consumers.

> Has congress decided that completely autonomous vehicles are allowed to operate on all roads?

Not as far as I know, but I think everyone will agree it's not a matter of if but when.

> Has the liability issue of autonomous vehicles been settled?

Same issue as the previous. Once autonomous cars are proven to be 10/20/100 times safer than human drivers, it's only a matter of time.

> You're selling me "hype" but youre not telling me why that hype is deserved.

You make a great point here and it's really the issue with a stock like Tesla. It's all about believing. Some people will believe everything Tesla announces, some will believe the what but not the when, and some will be sceptic of everything because it just seems so alien to someone living in 2020. So far, although their timelines have been off sometimes, Tesla has always executed and if you follow the autonomous developments closely you'd know they're making huge improvements, so I believe.There is a company that is doing better?But dont they just use basic 18650 cells? 

What revolutionary/innovative patents do they hold?They have never been a leader in battery technology. They have made some improvement in packaging only. They buy most of their battery from Panasonic if I recall. They pay licencing fees to produce them. 

They do have well refined charging algorithms but there is not much room for improvement there and I suspect most of the electric car companies have similar efficiencies.Gotchait is a sarcastic comment..But I believe you, there are a lot of idiots who believe them to be like Amazon without knowing a bookseller can also sell other stuff with their platform, but a hardcore tooled up car maker cannot pivot into other stuff without bunch of capital.It's best to sell right before the crash and buy at the lowest point. If it were so simple, everyone would be billionaires. It helps to be clairvoyant.If you sell then buy back in at a higher rate with less shares then i doesn't make sense.We'llThe powerwell is by no means unique.Waymo seems to be in the lead tbh. 

>In the world of autonomous vehicles, Google parent Alphabet's Waymo subsidiary is far and away ahead of any other company—as measured by quantity of vehicles operating, number of kilometers driven (32 million in the real world and more than 16 billion in simulation) and the sophistication of its technology.
In addition to camera, LiDAR, and radar sensors, Waymo cars also use microphones to detect sirens from emergency vehicles for autonomous functionality.

Among Tesla, you have GM, Argo, and Baidu as well.

Just to name a few of there patents.Or a breakout into unseen territory.Then you better sell now and buy back next March ehIs this really something that needs to be said?No no no I’m saying for example sell TSLA at $1600 and buy back at $800 (just an example) but of course nobody can predict these thingsI would think Tesla has more road hours, seeing that its vehicles are actually driven by consumers and this is set to grow exponentially.  Totally agree though that many automakers/Google XD  out there are catching up.All good things it seems, only one truly revolutionary patent, with the electrolyte additive solution, however other breakthrough battery tech exists like Lithium battery packs that do not explode and will continue to operate even after being completely punctured several times. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/scitechdaily.com/breakthrough-flexible-cuttable-lithium-ion-battery-wont-catch-fire-unbreakable-incombustible/amp/

This is kind of a bigger deal than chasing electrolyte solution additives and 18650 overcharging protections. If they do succeed in developing a "1 million mile battery" that would truly revolutionize the industry. 

Thanks for the info!Apparently it’s still being asked so... yeahThat would be a good idea.That depends on what was the original buy price?I think its autonomous driving miles though. But youre definitely right, as far as consumer miles/sales are concerned, Tesla is likely in the leadI'd keep an eye out for Battery Investor Day in September. If Tesla has any truly revolutionary patents it's going to be announced there. Keep in mind they haven't disclosed their new battery tech in over a year. It's kind of a public secret that they have the million mile battery, but there are rumours of a 2 million mile battery that would be in the Semi's that will be built in Texas.[https://twitter.com/i/lists/1280510712482332680?s=20](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1280510712482332680?s=20)

Plus links at bottom of that link. Options playbook is a good read.This is asked everyday, read sub historyYoutubeYouTubeI really like everything the CBOE offers: for free.
Google it and check it out.Yessss, hopefully we can get in <20 bln. I’m afraid this thing goes parabolic pre-market.It'll open at twice IPO priceMake sure you all set some high limit orders for this one.  I had one set at 30 for JAMF and that one got blown away.RemindMe! 10 DaysDo we know anything about what month they are thinking? Need to free up some cashHow much crossover would there be if I'm already invested in Cloudflare (NET)?!remindme 9 days!RemindMe 10 daysBeen saving money for this IPO specifically. Cant wait.Yeah I’m also afraid of that. Salesforce is going to make a killing on their equity stake...Yeah I think that’s probably a safe bet. I could see this going the way of Zoom and really taking off since it’s sort of a unique IPO.Dude, that sucks. Sorry to hear that. So frustrating....

I thought about trying to get in on JAMF, but saving my cash for Snowflake (hopefully lol).Market orders are the way to go I guessRemindMe! 10 DaysUnfortunately there’s next to no info. All I’ve seen is likely pre-election. But they’re not on the Nasdaq IPO calendar yet. My hunch would be September.They're both tech and involved with cloud, but they are completely different - Snowflake is a cloud database, Cloudflare is internet infrastructure and security.  So crossover in that they're both tech stocks, but that's about it.I've worked in data warehousing for 20+ years, and IMHO Snowflake is the best cloud database out there - Azure has tons of other features, but as far as warehousing goes, it's Snowflake all the way.  Should be a great long-term buy!If you want to guarantee you get some shares, it's the only way.Idk. It might be worth a play, it may not be.I was just having the same thoughtYes, a bomb went off in my entire portfolio.Just opened a Roth IRA this afternoon, that’s why.Stocks go up, stocks go down.I should have warned you. I bought some stock this morning. Don’t worry this happens every time.I’d say dropping more than 5% can be considered a small bomb. Today is just a really loud and smelly fart.If you are young you want stocks to go down because that means discount buying!The stock market was lower than it was a couple hours ago.  Get used to it, it happens a bunch.Heard there was a pandemic somewhere. Could have something to do with it.Great day to buy!Surprised we haven't seen more red lately, tbh.

Wasn't that long ago we were tripping circuit breakers and it's not like the world has improved much. If anything, the situation in the US is much worse.Same here just don’t look at ur portfolioSTOCKS JUST ILLEGALLY WENT DOWN

&#x200B;

can you believe this shit?i bought calls for microsoft 🙂😢Next time you decide to go for a walk please give us some heads up so we can close our positions.It's because I finally bought some shares of TSLA, sorry folks.Sentient cheetoh talking about fight with china tradeI just looked up WTH ticker like a degenerateI’m down in every god damn stock in my portfolio what a dayShits fucked in Asia and Europe right now, Armenia and Azerbaijan are shelling eachother, Greece is on their highest military readiness currently because turkey has sixteen naval vessels in the Mediterranean and China as pulled some shifty shit at their consulate in Houston because they are being evicted on Friday. Over all Asia and Europe are primed for proxy wars it seems like and the Middle East, Egypt, Libya and Iran all seem to high high tension pints right now especially after Egyptian parliament signed off on what is essentially war with Libya over a dam. All of this becoming aggregated into global markets through news and resulting in economic consequences seems to have finally come to a head today that’s my bet. In Other news I have no idea what I’m talking about.Everyone calm down, I knew this was coming.

Reason: I bought yesterday.Look at it as an opportunityunemployment happenedI'm asking the same questionStimulus news is over blown. No huge tax cut or just uncertainty. People always get out a day or two before news like this. I personally think we hit a peak for a while. I expect things to fall then go back up. It may implode during afterhours and really shake investers outWell in murica ya got two sides and they both sunk donk, ya got the blue team and ya got the red team.. there’s actually very little difference between the two - except for which voters they brand themselves to.. think 00’s windows vs Apple...

Then ya got the people stuck in between who mainly want to make bank and fuk hookers..

Then you got this here virus runnin round killing people and scaring the whole economy, forcing people to lose their jobs... 

Then you got all those people with no jobs getting paid for having no jobs and more people joining them because the virus is losing their jobs...

Red team and blue team agreed to pay those people with no jobs, which has allowed them to buy stuff pay off their mortgages and keep amzn +ve daily also contributed to wsb traffic. 

People keep getting unemployed at a higher rate this far into the virus which suggest that it’s a bad economy and permanent job losses..

Now all those free tendies those people got are gonna dry up, because red team and blue team are fighting over a new bill, red team says you are paying people not to work, blue team keeps adding shit into the bill to wind red team up.. then man in charge wants a payroll tax cut which nobody cares about.

So basically red team and blue team can’t agree on anything except for the fact they will agree one day, meanwhile in between all those people gettin free tendies ain’t gon get shit near what they getting... and more people are joining them, so nobody can afford to buy iPhones, buy tslas, eat out, buy hookers... YOLO spx 420 calls ...
So none of your stonks will have any income and none of your calls will print, people will take out money from stonks to buy shit, like food and stuff no more yolos...

So until red team and blue team agree??... 
the market is complacent that they will in time... they won’t they think it’s more sporting to damage everyone’s life in the processzIf you’re dumb like me, you just average down. Note that this is almost a guaranteed way to lose money 👍🏿Anyone still holding AMZN, Tesla or APPL should have expected thisUnemployment number posted as well.It was all hinging on the Washington Football Team namingDon't see red days as a problem. All red days mean is DISCOUNT buys. Green days are Sell/Hold days.I finally bought some stocks, that is what happened.You need to learn to invest only what you are willing to lose. Do not trade daily, but set aside an amount you want to invest every month when you get your paycheck, invest that and you will win long-term. Don't check the status of your investments everyday. Live your life instead!My wife got her period a week early today. Portfolio sank 20%. I should have read the omens.This happens pretty much every week; and often on Thursday or Friday.Idk, I have a lot of GLD and BLV. I'm lookin okay MSFT and AAPL are my only positions more than 1% down.I love these posts from the newbies lol


10% increase in 30 days.


People take profit.


I did it myself and have opened shorts, if you pay attention you shouldnt be surprised or caught of guard by this.


Also earning reports will cause some volatility.I wish it was only 0.1%. Lost 4.77 percent. I’m no baller.A believable albeit insufficient reality check

Much news today
Fairy tale is coming to an endReality set inMaybe the country figured out that...it doesn’t make any sense for the stock market to be this optimistic right now?

Ha. Silly me. That’s not happening any time soon.Market decided that NOW 1000+ deaths a day from COVID-19 is a problem.It’ll be back don’t worryim bleeding from my Orpheuses, plural.Every where, there’s blood, every where!Same damn thing happened to me! I am a bit surprised, but my analysis and projections show it will not last so no problem. Just have to wait a bit. lolFor reall fucken teslaThey took the payroll tax cut out of the stimulus bill. Lower taxes mean high stock prices. Higher taxes mean lower stock prices or at least that was a catalyst for a pull back. On top of this most of the time SPY makes a new high they will pull the rug out from under buyers at least one time before the market can move higher. On top of that tech stocks are under review for antitrust investigation, but tech is overheated and needed a breather anyway. All this is a good excuse to scare out buyers, sucker in some short sellers, all for smart money to get long and then rip the market higher next week when the stimulus bill passes.Relax, it’s a short term correction. Many companies have been beating on earnings and we’ve had nothing but Green Day after Green Day for weeks. A short term correction was needed. Don’t panic sell...It's not even down 2% lmaooooLmao it didn't even go down that much? Do you expect stocks to constantly go up every single day?Honestly why is it as high as it is right now anyways?The fact you think a bomb has to go off somewhere for the market to be red shows you are soon to be parted from your money. Walk away while you're ahead, if you are.Stonks are going on sale woooooWhat you bois thinking? Hold? I got shares in apple, amazon and google and the return is -3% rn* China / US tussle
* Unemployment numbers trended slightly higher for the first time in 4 months
* Economic stimulus package tussle between reps/cons
* Non-stellar tech earnings (note, several were good, but not 350 PE good)

In lieu of all the uncertainty -> Profit-takingMarket selloff. Seems pretty typical after a run like this. The Jim Cramer rule is that these selloffs last around 3 days. Basically, don't start buying until the end of the day Friday or early Monday.Guess the SALE just started..The stimulus package is falling apart.  Republicans can’t even agree amongst themselves, much less with dems.Unemployment and coronavirus numbers.  It's alright, take it in stride. The market will digest the news and move on over the next few weeks.It’s a freaking stock Genocide! I see rivers of blood on my stocks appUnemployment is up and deaths for the rona rona are climbing.About timeThis might be the start of the second crashMarket was getting really hot the past couple weeks. I'm surprised it didn't roll over sooner.Unemployment went up and everyone is trippingSurprisingly I didn’t drop that much lol honestly I think we’re value stocks are going to be doing betterOf course I pick today to transfer money out of my account. Ugh, several things I could have bought at the moment!The great rotation has occurred...that is until the Fed intervenes and then its BTFDYeah everything is red for me. Not really fussed though as most of my stocks have been bought at all time lows and I'm playing the long game. Apart from Microsoft. I just bought in today and now it's down 2%. Ah well.What goes up goes down. Nothing going on hereJobless claim number is up. Also the inflated unemployment ends soon. 

This should pressure Congress.My portfolio is still hemorrhaginglol for some reason whenever the markets are deep in the red my portfolio is always green and whenever stonks are rallying im always deep in the redwell, I spread a healthy amount of margin on that toast.That the time of the month for stocks.It’s the second Great Depression. Sell everything ASAP.  *Sarcasm*I went longThinking about picking up a MSFT and/or AAPL stock. Any thoughts?time to start buying!

around 70% of my account is cash and I enjoy buying more than selling cos it means money down the road.

I think I actually prefer a red dayThat was a NASDAQ dye pack. They want their gains back.I just hope my Microsoft call goes up before the 31st so I don't lose any money because right it looks horribleWhat happened? Opportunity for me to buy stocks cheaper than what I could have yesterday. Loaded up on some more Apple stock after hours.Ain’t it fun.I feel like most Monday it goes up and most Thursday it goes down.Maybe the tensions between US and ChinaDIS just anounced movie delays, waiting for the next Disney anouncement about a park princess with a coughWhy did ABUS spike today?I readjusted my 401k portfolio from 90% bond/10% stocks to 90% stocks/10% bonds after patiently waiting for months exactly to see the value decrease.Elon will tweet something soon don’t worryI bet that you saw many more unemployed people out there walking too.Yes all of us were invited to gangbang partyJust finishing the reject on the unreasonable 2+% day gain NASDAQ saw on Monday. The question is whether more of the unreasonable gains over the last two months will also be rejected in the coming weeks. The rally would have flattened out at about 9000 if people weren't doing so god damn much coke.Yeah my $Net position hit stop loss tooWell everything is red except AMD and 10¢, but still even for the day cause crypto. ETH is 🚀While I'm sad that my current stocks lost a few grand, my optimist side is thinking "More stocks for my monthly DRIP investment!"  


Some days, you have to make your optimism :pBuy the dip 😂😂😂Okay not just meShit I thought my day was bad just barely breaking even..  then I saw the market watch, holy crap what a bloody dayi feeel sorry for the bullish people who owned contracts... RIP.Just glad i am not the only one. I had to not even look at my stonks this afternoon. Red blood bath over here.Tesla had good earnings.

Also the market is coming to the realization that the Senate is about to keep 216 billion a quarter out of its pockets.Volatility always goes wild on earnings weeks for big tech and financial. This week has actually been smoother than I expected.Buy buy buySheriff of Nottingham came along and scared away the RHersJpow our of printDouble top on a speculative bubble peak.A pullbackOh no we’re right back to where we were on Monday in SPX.. the world is gonna end browho knows nothing is real anymorejust the startThe proper response is that unemployment numbers for the us came out todayI barely saw stocks go down. Hello? Anyone here in March relate?I have AMD so my portfolio took off.My sell order that dumped my BOXL when I hit 10% gains triggered, which was nice. Still holding HMHC for big gains.

But my netflix dumped q.qFunny enough, my entire portfolio, except for two index mutual funds, Uber, and DropBox , was in the green.US released unemployment numbers today. Not promising. Stocks reacted to that.Shorted Intel and bought AMD, all green baby!!!I haven't bought anything lately; With Corona Madness, Elections, Mobs, I just don't think we should be at the heels of the pre-virus high. A bigger drop than today and some 'scary' virus news and I think the whole house of cards could fall again. Keeping my eye on a few things though (T, RCL, WMT).Unemployment numbers (reported) rocketed that’s what.My portfolio got reduced by 20% which is about 4.5k in one day. I don’t know what I was thinking by not selling MSFT and TSLA spreads in the morning while they were profitable. Also, EBAY calls went down all week. Thursdays are usually shitty day for the market (from what I noticed) and unemployment report completely sank the ship of stock market today 🚢When I asked this same question, the vast majority people of this thread gave me nothing but crap.  :(TSN is up...Sorry guys, bought calls on SPYThis is how the last big drop felt like...just a number of redder and redder days until plonk, ya fucked.Grow up2 billion in SPY sold yesterday in huge orders...Just seems like normal volatility to me based on the last few months.Sale dayVTSAX and Chill unless you’re 90 and then panic!!!!We’re up from March.  Stonks don’t always go up.I bought MSFT when it was down, then it went even further down.Ended the day down 3%. But I was up like 3% a day or 2 before so. I'm up 0%?Hmm, I'm up 1% today! All green baby!It's the Chinese again. Didn't think this espionage news was gonna affect stocks this much though. Good news for gold investors I guess.While not ideal it serves up a buying opportunity. Am I happy my portfolio dipped 1%? No, of course not. But gave me an opportunity to buy more MSFT, APPL and set limit orders in case they go down even more (which I’m anticipating). Also providing me entry to Boeing, Salesforce. Looking more into e-commerce beyond amazon as wellNo pain no gainThat’s what you get for walkingMy put options printed.Stonks that's whyIt’s called profit taking.Please don’t go out for walks anymoreGold ETFs are booming though... Printer go brrrrrrrrrrrI'm pretty sure it has to do with the new jobs reporting and all the bad COVID newsAt first I thought there was a terrorist attack in  Silicon Valley- Pandemic

- US-China tensions

- US job losses not recovering

But again, these except for the last one where true a couple of days ago yet all went up, guess it is complicated.Same here, nothing my red all across the boardA beer bomb happened! $SAM LET'S GO!Crash. Nothing bigFrom what I read it dropped because of a giant spike in unemployment which is anticipating another market drop. Ironic huh?I bought PayPal when it peaked, haven't seen it in green since :).Omg Tesla went down to $1300 again, who would hVe thoughtHAHA I sold Tesla at 1700 and stayed in cash lmao I knew this was coming and gold at 2000 proved it, now I shorted Tesla to see it go down back to 1000 range or loweryes, the coronavirus bomb has gone off in the U.S.20/20 Hindsight for future reference:  
We were supposed to sell last week at peak green/FOMO.  
Then, we should have been flush with cash to wait for rock bottom/FUD to buy back in now.  


Oops, better luck next time!Maybe because COVID funding coming to an end next week?WTF dude?

It just went down 1%I’m up. KNOS making me good moneyWhat is the app?AAL went on sale, loaded up, next week it’ll go up enough to make a nice profit. Hope everyone got what they wanted while it was on sale. 👍My portfolio dropped 600 today. Could’ve been worse, I’ll take it.If you look at a 3 month SPY chart you'd see that there's resistance around 327. Today it looks like we bounced off that resistance, and if I had to guess, I'd say we're on our way back down to 300 before it breaks the 327. Couple this with mixed news about unemployment and many companies missing their earnings estimates, you get red.The fuse was lit at the end of the 2016 presidential election.China.So.... you bought tech after their huge price jumps and are surprised they dropped?Senate republicans are dragging their ass and fighting on a proposal. The market doesn’t like uncertainty. This is why it dropped this afternoon.[deleted]The tipping point into the second bear market dipPresident is now “taking COVID” seriously publicly.That’s normal. You will see some more red days in the coming months. Just make sure to buy good stocks and you will sleep better. Watch this! [Large cap stocks](https://youtu.be/b50k46U5tDA) and this!

I’m unfortunately never wrong when I say that.That’s already priced inBut Dave Portnoy told everyone stocks only go up!!!!!Can't explain that.Stocks go up, stocks go down, but stonks only go upThey can go *down*??? What the hell dude? No one told me that!!!You just can’t explain thatNever a miscommunication.but stonks only go up.No stocks only go up!!Bill O'Reilly gives stock adviseBetter hope it goes Down down. Sale is lifeStonks only go up thoughI'm a complete amateur but sometimes the posts here seem so pointless and alarmist to even me. It's like they've never had stocks before? 

People trying to give explanations and narrative's to every little change. 

Wonder what the general usefulness is of coming here as a newbie and what the experience of the 750,000 odd subscribers is like.I mean the S&P will always go up over time, it will have it's dips but should increase considerably every 10 years.I was told stocks only go upBlasphemy! Stonks only go up.Same tbh, bought Tesla at high, fml.Yep exact same situation hahaI bought a 100 dollar spy call... i broke the marketGenerally I agree, but with everything going on this year, if the markets were to drop 5% tomorrow I think there would be a lot of panic of ‘the bubble popping’ and could potentially cause an undesirable domino effectMy portfolio looked like the Manhattan ProjectThis. They are just numbers on a screen and usually don't mean that much, but the bright colours fool us into thinking that something bigger is going on. Some days market goes down a percent or two, but our banks show the same red page as if it was -40%.Yeah but I don’t want it to go down right after I dump $6k into my account 😔S&P down 1.23%. DJIA down 1.31%. NASDAQ down 2.29%. 

And OP asks if a bomb went off. 

If you freak out over these kind of dips the stock market is not for you.Oh my god my 7/31 Nikla put just went green overall. It’s been red down to -50% for like three weeks straight...but....my...money..... ..
my...stonks.....  ThEY hAVe nO RIghT!??!?!?!Doubt itA pandemic? 

 Huh.  

Must not have reached the US yet.Wait what is the pandemic thing you are speaking of?Nothing I want is for sale:(I swear y’all buy a stock that’s on “sale” cuz it’s 5% down in a day even though it just shot up 420% the day before thinking it’s a deal 🙄It's down to where it was 3 days ago.still wait for 30% crashWow down four percent. It’s a fucking fire sale!A million deaths is a statistic. People are becoming numb until an infrastructure collapsehaven't sold anything since bought in march and a little here and there on some dips, we still in the greenIs that a trump tweet?How so?Bruh same 😢😢So you are in acceptance stage now? That was fast.Same, I was holding out and before close yesterday I picked up some options. Everything I touch is red now 😂You corny“Sentient Cheetoh” I fucking love it, gonna start using this oneOofYay the retardLMAO nice :DThere's something poetic about my two airline stocks being my only two greens lol.Same.  Very red day.  Better be a goddamn good stimulus package in the pipeline to pump things back up.This is the way..Of my 35 stocks, Cheesecake Factory, Comcast, Danaher, Forrester Research, Hershey, Lemonade, Purple Innovation, Redfin, and Rosetta Stone all went up.So military industry complex about to be banking then, huh?Dont think of it as losing a brother, think of it as gaining a delicious corpse.Always.  I see red and think, I’m going shopping.  😎🤩🔥Please... unemployment happened 4 months ago. markets been going up and down everyday. Day1: "market shrugs off covid cases for rally" day2: "market recedes on increasing cases" day3: "market climbs dispite unemployment" day4: "unemployment numbers drive selloff"... i could write the market speculations with my eyes closed for the next month.It got extended?While I find your description very ho-hum, it's still entertaining to read. Thanks for the laugh sir.Blue team isn’t “adding things in”, red team never wanted to provide more support and are trying to figure out how they could potentially profit from a second round before releasing it. The PPP loans were a scam for red team to reward their friends and ignore small businesses in need.Love the Team America referenceWhat's wrong with averaging down?I average down by rebalancing. But a whole lot of people here are 100% equity which means there isn't much rebalancing that can be done.I set a stop-loss on $TSLA and took my profits. It was a fun ride!Why Apple thoughDecided to get into stocks too recently. It was holidays and I was bored. I would undo everything if I could.At least she got hers..At least you have a wife.  Half the people on here only have a hand full of Amzn/tesla/MSFT shares to comfort themselves when the winter comes.Your pull out game is clearly strong, but not where it mattersThen we can have record breaking Mondays. I swear Mondays have been hella green lately.My guess is day/swing traders closing out the long positions they don't want to hold over the weekend idkGLD makes perfect sense.  Money printers all over the world making 2008 look like an old dot matrix printer.  It will keep going up.  
  
What was your reasoning with BLV?If you know this is coming why didn't you short amazon/tesla/Microsoft/appl?

I wouldn't consider myself a newbie and was completely off guard.  I did take the opportunity and bought a bunch of shares.  Probably more than most people's net worth.As well as eurydice?The Tech was called "safe heaven". Now it is clear - the only safe heaven is cash. Why would anybody invest in 'safe heaven' that drops 5 per cent a day? it's no heaven. it's shitAmd down 3.59% :/I do. i do not buy into tech bubble. pretty much everyone else on this sub though  is loaded on techNo. Not all stocks reacted to that. Only overvalued "safe tech". I was looking to buy some other stocks like visa, pepsy or some farma stocks - and none dip, but actually , they grew. Get out of tech bubble.when I said the buble will burst on earnings day - they downvoted me and called me an idiot.Ballsy move.   

I am holding on.  The thing about TSLA is that if you have the stomach to take a 10%-15% down for weeks, you'll be rewarded with a 100% return at the end.

At least that's what I am telling myself to be able to sleep better at night. :)Is that 1% or 0.1%?A correction is at least 10% not 1.33% lolBeing 12 years old is hardIf there was a red darker than blood, that would be itProbably already boughtMaybe he should wait and buy the crater laterIts a ROTH IRA, a dip doesn't matter at all.He’s probably crying right nowHe might have said that, but he really meant that STONKS only go up.He’s a hackYou mean stonks?Damn magnetsStanks only go downA common misconception; stocks frequently fluctuate, whereas stonks only go to the moonThis is WSB way..How high?  i bought it at 1765 :(, it will take days  to get my money back.I maintain that tesla is single-handedly responsible for this drop. Its so retardedly overvalued with its stupid meme status of people just wanting a piece of Elons galaxy brain as opposed to any concept of the value of the underlying asset, that every other 'tech' stock is being treated as guilty of equal overvaluation by association.That's on youRip me, do you think it will rebound tomorrow?Yeah same bought at $1650 prior to opening after a positive earningThere was more than a 5% drop near the beginning of June... What happened? People just bought the dip, and the losses are more than fully recovered.I've got a lot of cash on hand to buy the sale so I hope you're right! 

But I also doubt it. People said this about that 5% drop a few weeks ago. And now we're at or close to ATH in every index.

1-3% dip is nothing.Then you shouldn't be investing in the stock market to begin with.

No one knows what's going to happen tomorrow. If you can't stomach even tiny dips like 1-3% open a savings account or a CD.In the big scheme of things $6k is a drop in the bucket.Dollar cost averaging is your friend, especially in this market. Attempt to spend $500-1000 a week versus all at once. You'll make smarter decisions near the end versus the begining, and in all likelihood, you're more like to save money this way than to miss out on big gains.You could take the approach to always have a percentage of cash on the side to invest in case of a huge dip. Keep it as an insurance policy. It helps when you're feeling concerned about your entry point. That way if the market goes down you can be happy to be able to take advantage of a better price. Once you accumulate more cash, then you can invest your insurance policy, perhaps diversify into something else.  

 And always think long term concerning what you already have invested.lolIf I may ask why was it such the red day, was it pretty much the unemployment numbers and spiking cases or was there more news I missed?I like how people downvote because they’re butt hurtIt JUST went green? I'm pretty new to options so maybe I'm a dumbass, but Nikola has fallen like a stone the last few weeks. Can you post your positions?I'm awaiting my stimulus.  we've had one yes, but what about second stimulus?

Wont somebody care about the stockholders of this country?And if it does, we can just nuke it.Apple 5% downThe one stock I've been trying to accumulate this month (Accenture) still refuses to dip, and I'm wary of buying at an all-time high in this environment.Prepare to wait for a long time. You must have missed the beginning of the year and 2018No crash with so much money pouring inAren't we all. I've been holding my nutsack since March 23rd.NoIf you're trying to buy low, mortgage related stocks like MFA and IVR are near their March lows right now.This is basically the last time to buy right now. In September the first working vaccines will come out and Trump will not allow for a market crash to happen before the election. If he loses it's great news too, because Biden will not touch his billionaire buddies and announce large infrastructure rebuilding projects and get on his knees for China.One percent... "great day to buy the dip bois! 1% drop when the S&P 500 is near all time highs during a massive pandemic that's only getting worse! Bargains everywhereeee!"Diamond hand.

I tried but never was able to hold on for too long.  Buying and selling are addicting.They closed lower than they opened. The SEC needs to address this immediately before investors completely lose trust in the market. Absolutely bs.I’m a big fan of ‘Mango Mussolini’ personallyYes so original...Spirit lets go... 😂Why are you invested in Cheesecake Factory 😭Well Lockheed Martin just sold 45 F-35 ll and 65 F-35B  configuration to japan on an expedited sell order from the DOD after our little covid outbreak incident outbreak on one of our marine bases there, so in short it’s popping off also China is imposing “sanctions” on Lockheed Martin over the sale of the F-35’s and the sail of repurposed patriot Systems to Taiwan. The “sanctions” only seemed to add green to Lockheed’s stock after the news broke. Watch out for BAE systems too they have a promising future with Northrop and Lockheed maybe even a triple merger into a separate devoted company just for the Airforce, Navy and DOD.Check out Rhinemetall too Rhinemetall is popping off after their billion dollar arms contract with Saudi Arabia and shhhh Israel but no one can prove Israel funded some of the deal, but it’s the general consensus in the intelligence community that they did.Aren't the Republicans tryign to end the benefits though?  Seems $2400/month less for unemployed might impact market.Yes, but its worse than they expected.Mitch laughsHo-hum?Ya see kids here’s what happens when you play red team blue team... 

Everyone argues and nothing gets done...
We ain’t playing red team and blue team hoire.This x 1000.You get fucked if the stock doesn’t go back upI believe XD sadly I wasnt in at rocket launch so no way I was joining that ridiculous rideOver 20% in 3-4 months is not a healthy market for such a huge company. Its not sustainable at all in the long runMust be nice to have tsla sharesThe long term bond index funds have been performing better when the market goes down than their treasury counterparts. That’s basically the extent of it. Bonds do well during downturns and treasuries make me nervous right now.> Probably more than most people's net worth.

The median net worth is about $11,00 (at least in US) so not sure that's as big a *$#k measure as you'd hoped.

> I did take the opportunity and bought a bunch of shares. 

After close? This isn't snarky, this is an honest question, how does one go about doing that? I doubt I ever would want to, but just curious if average joe's and joanna's are able to do so.Cus i did? Or the SPX atleast. Long from 3k. Also long on eurusd and silver, exited 50-70% positions earlier today. Entered some short.


Touching tesla is bad cus IVIdk, tech could all be overvalued cuz of the rally who knowsHOld some bond etfs. Perfect for rebalancing and reinvesting in equity during a crashAfter hours up 8.02% ;) thoMust be nice to be loaded on techpharma dipped too-- look  at Moderna and Arcturus for example...OxbloodIt made mine green, because I've been betting on this shit to kick off.Bought some but not all; won’t matter much at all in the grand scheme of thingsNo, he said when they go down, they print more Schrute bucks and *then* they go back up, he’ll be buying the dip like the rest of usHe’s buyingProbably not he’s only worth like 200 millions dollars and is his own boss what a terrible lifesports started again, he sold all positions.Dave Ramsay doesn’t own stocks, he sells $29.99 e-books to new investors - convincing them to buy more products and attend his seminars so they can learn how to eliminate their debt by paying cash for “knowledge”.He is an entertainer, people wish he was a guru.factsLove the guy, but why is he on CNBC - cmon, hes gambling with a big pocket book. Not someone to take advice from.Word.Might be more than just days.whats wrong with you guys buying TSLA at THIS price? Literally anyone, even people holding the stock, knows its valuation is just insane. I too am upset I did not buy TSLA when it was under $400. Fomoing in at this price is just stupid though. You realize if the market drops again, its the stocks that have run up the most that people take profits from the fastest, right?

Lots of people I know that have been holding TSLA for awhile are selling most of their positions to lock in gains and invest in stocks that have room to grow. They will buy it back cheaper when it nearly almost positively will be

You will be very lucky if you think you'll get your money back in days. It dropped after a profitable earnings and news that it will be included in the S and P 500....Yep, I'm down 550 for the day :/Bought it at 1600.aw man. I was upset that I got it at 1593 and then the price dipped right after buying itTesla is the next Cisco. Who knows how high the stock will go? But then when it hits that high, 10 years later it still won't have reached a new high.

It's the fate of all cult stocks that get pumped to insane valuations. If the company is successful it takes 10 years for the profits to catch up to the share price. Happened to all of the Tesla's from 20 years ago like Cisco, Microsoft, Intel ... they were Tesla back in the day.

But Tesla can still go a lot higher short term because it's a cult stock. But ti's not a buy and hold for 20 years because the valuation is getting too insane. Will take 10 years for the profits to justify the valuation. But I hope you make a million before the stock price tops out.You're not getting it back bro lolSorry i screwed you over,  bought tesla at 1550. Now it's downhill from here.Yes, I think so. Due to multiple reasons, the new factory, battery, potential spy500. Let's hope so. What do you think?Oh i didnt buy TSLA but the whole amrket was red so...y'all are insane buying TSLA at this price... Why don't you buy stocks that do not move 100's of dollars in either direction each day and actually have lots of room to grow? Not one that has gone from under $400 in March to nearly a 2k highYea but this is the stock market. Every reaction is an over reaction man. All I can say, do a lot of DD and leave your emotions out of it.Shhh, facts aren't allowed on this fearmongering forumExactly!

Know what you're buying, (even if you're scalping.)

Good companies come back and their stocks eventually do go up.I agree, but to be fair it didn’t seem like they were panicking or anything. Just disappointed to see it’s gone down right after they bought everything and missed out on a potential “discount”.Well in either case, nobody wants the market to drop right after buying in.Hasn’t lump sum investing shown better results historically than DCA?might be cuz of all the earnings that was released this week or people had some sense and noticed we r still in a pandemic**tl;dr** stocks go in, stocks go out. you can't explain that.

New cases per day are actually down, NYT reported the current 14-day trend as +27%; it was in the +60% every day just last week. However, deaths are up (which was expected, there's always a delay compared to new cases).

I don't think it was the unemployment numbers, which I remain somewhat skeptical about when it comes to what they really mean. For example I am working reduced hours at my job but also collecting unemployment that makes up for that, including the $600 from the CARES Act. It's an agreement that was made between my employer and my state government.

So, I am making basically my pre-COVID salary+$600/week at a very stable job, but am counted as someone who has filed for unemployment.

I know this is probably an uncommon (and incredibly lucky) situation, but how uncommon is it? How many people are technically filing for unemployment but are still working or have agreements with their employer to go back to work? Or are being supported by the government? It's anecdotal but I know a lot of people who lost jobs due to COVID in March/April and have already found new (and often better) jobs that are adapting to our new reality.

Long story short, unemployment seems like a catastrophe right now, but I'm not convinced. This isn't the Great Depression Part 2. Are things bad? Yes. Is it going to get worse during Autumn/Winter? Almost definitely if we don't have a vaccine. But society is not on the verge of collapse. 

Anyway, if I had to guess about the dip today it's probably just people trying to lock in gains because they're short-term investors and think we're at or near the top of what they perceive to be a bubble. Especially tech stocks. This is why I'm mostly in VOO/VTI + BLV (decent returns so far despite the hate around bonds) + cash to take advantage of any large dips in the future (today was not that day).

But I also have no idea what I'm talking about so please do not make any financial decisions based on anything I've just written.The real question is why haven’t there been more red days like this not your question.  

If you are confused then you aren’t paying attentionI'm looking forward to their new model car, the Nikola Jpeg!Isn't this the sub that hates options and think everyone should only hold stocks for 30 years though?Both 7/31, one was $40 and one was $35. I like a common retard bought while they were falling last time, so price was higher than if I’d bought while they were at 60 or something.

The thing with options is that the time value is a part of the cost to purchase. So if you buy four weeks out like I did, and then JPMorgan reiterates their $45 price target and Nikla immediately spikes back to $55, you’re stuck holding them in the red. When the price drops again 3 weeks later, you’ve also lost 3 weeks of time value as well. 

Example, I purchased these for $6 and $6.80. With Nikla now at 34.21, the same options are worth $3.07 and $6.68. The 40 is currently green because it’s far enough under 40 to make the intrinsic value higher than the lost time value over that period.

Hopefully that helps? Dunno if I wrote clearly or just confused you more tbhMost American thing I've read this morningNot nearly enoughSo it's back to where it was last Wednesday. Not exactly a saleNot for me. I prefer a higher margin of safety. I’m trying to exercise my patience muscle and not rush.\> Apple 5% down

also

microsoft down 4.3% 

after better than expcted earning report

intel  down 7% 

neat estimates and 20% revenue growth but after market because of news about 6 month delay in next chip

&#x200B;

i'm loading up on XLK first thing in the morning. (the etf's top holding are microsoft, apple, visa, intel, and mastercard make up 50% of the etf's holdings)

&#x200B;

xlk was down 2.6% yesterday

it's more than i wanted  to dip into my cash savings but i'm not gonna pass this up.I got in when it was down 2%! Shoulda waited a little longer but anyways it was a calculated “hold until profitable” move. Should do just fine unless China collapses over night. i was buying at every crashdebt sale ratio is 10-20x thanks but no thanksOh you know vaccines usually take years in the making and not months. And there was no report of any big success leading to a vaccine. This is going to get really funny when winter comes around. But let’s stay optimistic.There is a reason that Gold and Silver are going up so fast today.  The big players are getting out of U.S. stocks because the U.S. dollar may collapse much sooner than expected.  We could be at a breaking point.  Wouldn't surprise me if China called in some of that precious U.S. debt in order to push things further along.I guess I don’t know much about the stock market but I thought that prices can shift overnight due to after-hours trading.Cheetoh Benito is my faveIm partial to Fanta Fascist and Agolf Twittler. I have also heard Hair FurorI wanted a high risk restaurant stock as a growth bet. Now I'm bagholding it......

Ironically, all the other stocks I listed above have been huge for me this past month, which is not normal. This is usually my bad collection haha.

Hershey's been going through the roof, Purple, Redfin and Rosetta are on fire, Danaher's at ATH, Lemonade's up 20% since I bought in, and I bought Forrester last August when it had like a 30-40% drop in one day and it's FINALLY not declining. And Comcast has finally broken through into the low-40s.

Fingers crossed for CAKE.Might is an kind of an understatement. This will end ending cashflow for 10-12% of the 'working' population, most of whom are out of work by no fault of their own. The GOP-supported plan initially called for a $500/wk cut to benefits; whether or not they actually support that cut is a matter of controversy, apparently the GOP has been infighting over this for the past 2 months since the house passed it's version of the bill... because it's going to directly affect nearly 20 million people. 

On top of that, they aren't sending their plan through until next week. UI Benefits end today. Had this been a bipartison stimulus/relief bill I would be less critical, but Senate democrats have had no input into it. What the fuck is Mitch McConnell doing?The Senate and White House are currently negotiating with the House for a continuation of benefits.

No one wants to be blamed for a repeat of the Great Recession, especially not Mitch McConnell who is facing his first serious challenge in years this November.

There will be another aid package, I guarantee it.Cant wait... when the cares act ends the loan payment suspensions end so banks and reits bounce in 2 quartersNobody is trying to end the benefit. The benefit ends on its own this/next week depending on state. Now it’s up to the dems and republicans to agree on how to extend it.You live in a dream world.Everyone thinks this is a financial crisis like 08, not realizing the manual shutdown. Idk if your republican democrat libertarian vegetarian. I dont follow red blue purple, just green and if you can sit a top the fence and look down its pretty cut and dry. The economy will come back ask the 20 yr history of china after the first sars outbreak (before they went on an economic tear unseen beofore)There’s nothing to discuss, it’s all true. You’re either not paying attention or listening and reading shit that lies to you.For meme stocks sure, but for companies that's aren't going to just vanish in the near future it's relatively low risk, if you're planning to hold for long.I mean, if you're smart to not invest in the stupid meme stocks that David Portnoy and his ilk recommend, you shouldn't have to worry about that.Up 75% from its March lowsI bought the shares between 2 pm-3 pm so it's well within opening hours.  Many brokers let people buy and sell stocks between 7 am to 7 pm. 

11k is still a respectable amount to buy in a single day.  I bought quite a bit more than that.There are many other relatively safe companies to invest into and get dividends much higher than bonds. A little more risky than bonds, but less risky than Tech stock.Good to hear. It’s been sideways since I bought it around 51.🌈 🐻First day of a public sector Econ class I was in years ago. Pretty old and wiry Professor comes in and without saying anything to us the first thing that come out of his mouth is this: If you learn or remember nothing else from this class, just make sure that it’s to open a Roth IRA... Opened a Roth with my first employer out of college lolNo he said when the Schrute bucks go DOWN, Stanley Nickels go UP. I’m pretty sure.Even rich boys cry sometimesWalking with the prince of peace!Its not like he even does analysis and shit, he just buys what people tell him to buy mostly lmaoYou can literally tell when he’s in character or not & it’s crazy most people haven’t figured it out yetMight be neverI might have to buy more at cheaper price to bring the average down.I am still new into this. Learning with every trade.Relaxyou realize tesla drops for 1-2 days every earnings then jumpsI bought may last year, and sold for 1500 last week. I completely agree with you!I bought $5 worth the other day just so I can come along for the rideI'm upset I didn't pull the trigger when it was around 290 last year.. I could have transfered enough funds to buy at least 4 shares, but didn't want to risk it. Oh well, I ended up needing that money elsewhere. Still upset about it though.I am out at break even or a total write off for me. It can stay in my portfolio to look pretty.Who cares, already made more than that in penny stock pre market today.If the market is red that's exactly when you buy. 

Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.That’s exactly why. Because they don’t move $100s a day80% of this sub are not investing, they are trading. Traders don't have the same safety in their stocksEvery reaction is not an overreaction. That's a mindless cliche. This isn't just random arbitrary bullshit contrary to what 2020 might look like. 

Believing every action in the market isn't real, or overreacting, is like believing stonks only go up. You might as well just invest in an index fund if that's as deep as your thoughts goWell.  Not really.  
  
Look up the Output Gap.  The entire world is set to lose something like $9T in GDP this year.  That money just straight goes up in smoke.  The markets may not recover back to their previous levels for 5-10 years.  It's unknowable, but it is entirely possible that the next 5-10 years will show a net loss for your portfolio.  In which case you'd be better off pulling out now and reinvesting later.Exactly is right.

I'm not even some big player in the market, I make around 30k/year and through patience and smart investing I've made a ton of money just by buying small dips.

I will never understand why people sell when the market is down. Why would you sell something when the price is low? Ridiculous.I'm sure it has in certain cases, especially more experienced investors, but "An Intelligent Investor" states that in most environments, putting a monthly (or even weekly) sum into a stock will lead to less overall loss.But we’re in a unique case, right now where the market has these amazing days and horrible ones and ok, but it hasn’t been fixated on a clear down trend because of the pandemic overall, everything has been trying to rebound or has started to.Yeah the whole unemployment situations has been weird, personally I’m going to start filing as I’m about to quit my job and chill for a few weeks before I move to college, however if you quit you can’t technically receive unemployment but I used to be a teachers pet to my manager and I’ll think she’ll allow it if I ask her to “lay me off”. 

A lot of the FAANGs bled today, and many people were taking profits off of earnings this week> New cases per day are actually down, NYT reported the current 14-day trend as +27%; it was in the +60% every day just last week. 

This is actually still an increase since the trend is referring to the rolling average of "new cases per day." But it is an apparent deceleration of the _rate_ of increase, which is something. i.e. the car is still accelerating, but you're not flooring it anymore.Lol that guy is a snake-oil salesmanPretty much. This sub is basically r/investing. Day trading, options, and penny stocks are not really encouraged here.I SOLD $110 January $110 puts collecting $7800 in premium for each contract sold ($78.00) and today I bought those puts back for a few grand PROFIT. But, I sold them when I.V. was at like 450%. Now that the drop happened, I.V. is much less, making premiums (option prices) much less expensive

So, even though though I sold the puts when NKLA was close to $70, they were worth LESS when the stock is under $40 :)

Options are very complex. You need to know about theta and I.V. otherwise you do not know shit (not saying you, just saying in general)I want to give you gold but I'm gonna use that money to buy some $HTZWell we aren’t as intelligent as you sorryNew to all of this and trying to learn, can I ask for your reasoning in this? I see that XLK dropped as well but don’t quite understand the buying into it when it’s only dropped ever so slightly.China collapse would be worth it imhoOK, good for you. quick question depending on how big a crash you define as a market crash(and a 30% dive is up there) market crashes happen about every decade. what the hell do you do with your money the rest of the time and does it bug you that you miss out on some pretty massive growth in between(which is quite often higher than the entire decline before including dividends and compounding).Imagine being this uninformed and proud of it. Oxford will have their vaccine ready soon.He’s just fuckin with youThats a 90's one hit wonder I'm convinced.These are new and I love them lolAgolf Twittler made me short milk out of my nose. I don't even drink milk!Have to say I agree. Gotta love the narratives being pumped by the press though.You think banks will bounce with all the mortgage defaults coming?Allowing it to expire is essentially the same as ending it. Some Republicans favor that, though some want to replace it with smaller aid.Oh, I thought the Democrats in the house already passed a bill to extend it and it was in Republicans court (Senate) now.Please elaborate.That plus the 6 TRILLION that went to special debt purchase vehicles setup by the fed in March to keep multinational corporations afloat during the crisis by buying up all of their worthless debt that would have and never will pay out.  

Our government just blew out the next few generations wealth to prevent private shareholders from taking the same hit the US taxpayers are taking.  Not only that, they are using the US taxpayers funds to do it.aka STOCKS ONLY GO UP

&#x200B;

\^\^\^until they don'tYou don’t know what companies are going to vanish though, look at Enron.ExactlyAh yes, I'm thinking 2:00 my time which is market close. Appreciate the response, and again, don't think it's best to be wagging around, but you do youI mean bond etfs doesnt really drop too much during a recession (either drops few days later, doesn't drop at all or only drop few percentages) so you can quickly sell them cuz they r very liquid, rebalance it during a crash by buying a stock etf and when the stock etf soars, rebalance it again by selling the stock or etf and placing it into a bond etf. Even if its a safe company, it would usually drop during a crash.

Dividends are just a nice add on  :)Haha a good story, apparently it’s been driven home enough to me because I’m only a junior in college and I’m using paychecks from my internship to contribute. I did one of those online calculators, learned the time value of money and power of compound interest and that was enough to run, not walk, to Vanguard.I‘m from Europe. What‘s Roth IRA?Man, I wish I could have a roth IRA, but apparently my country sees no point in having such a thingKid is still in college... will do that with his first years' earnings as student lab assistant. 

They invented the 401k after I had been working a few years, with lots of strings ( open to you after a year's service, options to change annually...) I got a late start, and was grossly underpaid for a few years, too. Lesson: start early. Start your kid early. Lend them money to do it. Time makes these easy wealth builders.Is it like Alex Jones's character ?Was that personal trainer that fucked his girl in character too?probably tomorrow thouoghYou’re gonna destroy the stock market. Had Warren Buffet reached out to you for stock tips yet?Two reasons TSLA cld make another large move in the short term: 1) number of Shorts with bets against TSLA  2) rumors of potential for SPY listing.         those two reasons alone will keep this trading in a tight range.   Unlikely to bleed that deep red  imoEveryone buying TSLA is new to this, which, is why you should not buy it

and you should not be trading. You should be investingI am? I am warning all these new kids to be carefulHappy Cake Day!Keep doing that and I guarantee you'll lose all your moneyAgree. There's no point to buy when everyone buys it.Yeah, its great when it moves $200 up for the day, what about down?

If another sell off happens, which, many predict it will, the first stocks people are going to take profits from are stocks that are up 100s of %. You know, like TSLA? Why do you think tech is bleeding right now but "value" stocks like airlines are up? People are taking profits from stocks that are at all time highs and putting them in things that are still over 50% from their previous highs...

buying any stock that moves up over 10% (up or down) daily, on no news, is pure gambling.So you’re telling me when a stock goes down it doesn’t go ever go up? Or when a stock goes up it doesn’t ever go down? Check minute, daily, and weekly graphs and you’ll understand more.If you think you are timing "dips" you're just... fooling yourself.  
  
Nobody can time dips.  You don't know if its at the bottom yet, and you don't know it will ever beat where its at.cuz it's all priced in...I obviously don't know your situation but it's funny you mention quitting your job and moving to college. My employer is actually in this sector so I have a lot of information about how universities and colleges are handling this situation, and the answer is "not very well."

If I were you, I would be very very careful and prudent about what your next moves are when it comes to college, especially if that means quitting a job in the middle of what could turn out to be one of the worst economic crises in American history (probably unlikely, like I said in my original post, but still possible!). The college I work with has not yet made a decision about opening up and won't until late-August but I would not be surprised at all if they do not for the Fall Semester, which would be a financial disaster for them. 

And it would also make for a very pointless semester for students. College is a LOT more than just taking classes and you should not be paying tens of thousands of dollars to listen to some professor lecture on Zoom. You can already get that for free.

Anyway, good luck to you with whatever you do my friend! I hope everything works out well for you. Just make sure you consider the future before you make any big choices./r/investing oscillates wildly between 3 fund indexing for life and full WSB depending on the day/thread/market conditions

This is more just the active investing subTotally agreed, great follow-up :D not understanding those two will totally fuck you if you don’t see them coming and think options function like stocks doSold on margin?Instead buy some Hyliion before the mergerHuh?sure xlf is a technology exchanghe traded fund... they diversify into the tech industry and are a good alternative is you don't have the cash to buy full shares of microsoft and apple  ..i dont lol... 

XLK's top 4 holding's are

Microsoft Corp	MSFT	22.01%
Apple Inc	AAPL	19.43%
Visa Inc Class A	V	5.05%
Intel Corp	INTC	4.31%

apple is down 5% on good news
micosoft is down 4.3% on good news
intel is down 7% on good news (earnings wise. the 6 month chip delay is nothing major)

if all 3 bounce back that's a huge profit.

those four make up just over 50% of XLK fund's holdings.

 so buying xlk you are buying a fund where apple, microsoft and intel are the 3 companies that  make up about half of what the fun is invested in...


essentially buying xlk is buying a little apple, a little microsoft, and a little intel... which are all down between 4% and 7% despite good news and being the safest bets for growth of any stocks right now

xlk being down 2.6% .... with half of it's money invested in microsoft, apple, and intel....  it's a safe bet that that all 3 are going to bounce back tomorrow and continue to grow for a long time.

xlk is up 25% in the last year...35% in the last 3 months. this little 2.6% dip is the best little drop with a near 100% guarentee to go up (way up) that you're going to ever see 


arkk is another etf to look at because it's owns more tesla than another etf.. and is also invested in other solid companies so you can ride the tesla wave and not get burned when the tesla bubble pops

arkk is up 70% on the year

i loaded up on arkk today when tesla dipped

and i'm gonna load up an equal amount on xlk tomorrow because microsoft apple and intel are all dipping. 

a comparison of xlk and arkk ... both funds very smart buys. smart safe and big returns. (you buy the fund like a stock, xlk is the symbol for the fund diversified into 50 different companies... 50% of it is microsoft, apple and inte... 47 other tech companies make up the other 50%)

here's a comparison of the two funds:
https://www.askfinny.com/compare/xlk-vs-arkk

im going to buy just as much xlk as i spent on arkk today (which is still a good time to buy,,, i recommend doing the same but thats just my opinion)

does that make sense? im not great at explaining.. or i over explain sometimes lollol wutyou know nothing about risk management? are you either all stock or all cash?This is exactly how the current administration thinks. It’s just not the truth. I really at best think we will have a vaccine ready to go by January. This is not some small thing. A vaccine can’t be just be rushed in 4 months. Obviously we wish it could but it’s just not possible.You seem to live in a different reality..., Oxford said that after tests the vaccine is helping the immune system just like every other vaccine tested right now. BioNtech made a successful supporting vaccine but this is no where near an actual vaccine for Covid-19. WHO is expecting the first vaccine in 2021, making you immune against Covid. Imagine being this uninformed and proud of it. 

More than 20 different vaccines are getting tested btw. And yes Oxford is pretty far but thats nothing in that kind of market.Lol this guyI am going to go insane with you people.

**A vaccine sitting on a desk approved for release won’t magically be available to you the same day or month or maybe even year**. Needles need to be produced, vaccine kits produced, shipped all over, scheduling and prioritizing high risk people first, cost and payment problems. It won’t be free in America so can we even get to herd immunity? Booster shots may be needed since no long term study will be done on each vaccine formulation.

We are going to need **billions** of these. You can’t make those over night.

Now backing up, drug trials can take 5-10 years on average. Rushing anything *will* have negative consequences. Trials are done for good reason. Do you want more antivaxxers and problems because putting out an unsafe or ineffective vaccine will do that.History repeats itself. 2009 record defaults. 2010 record new small businesses.Plus an estimate up to 70% of suspended mortgage owners havent completely lost income/are unable to pay. Ppl are (wisely) taking advantage of the inttest free delay. Im actually kinda surprised in the market demand but then again the earnings speak for themselves.Some companies are not going anywhere.   Johnson and Johnson, Walmart, McDonalds, coke.  Not terribly exciting stocks I know.I think it’s pretty much a forgone conclusion that by the time you or I retire Americans will be paying considerably more in all forms of tax. Taking advantage right now is one of the smartest things you can do. It really amazes me the amount of people who don’t even have a fundamental understanding of compound interest. It’ll make you rich in old age if you’re smart when you’re young.Dude, awesome.  A guy today told me his secret to millions was compound interest.  It’s so boring but it’s true.  I entered late to the game (40s) and I’m kicking myself for not starting at your age.  If you just toss a little here and there at your age, and keep doing it, you will be doing so well in 20 years!I've had vanguard for years through my work, so the pay any fees 😄 I'm up to 19% on my contributions.Good for you.   I do all my investing/trading with Roth IRAs.  That way I can trade daily and never worry about taxes.  Plus I can ignore my losses when the market dips since I have plenty of time to wait until things go back up.  I even set up one for my daughter who is 15.  She doesn't have any earned income so I put it in my name, with her as the beneficiary.  She can use it to invest in whatever she likes (my goal is to get her interested in investing) and when I die she will be able to transfer it into her name.+1Cant you still open your Own Roth IRA with an American bank in a private account?

I have a Roth IRA I fund myself with TD Ameritrade. I just opened the account by myself online.Or Kanye’s characterWas it your girl who got Jeff Bagwell’d?[deleted]It's like 1489 right now*short stock to offset losses*Should I expect it to touch 1800 anytime soon?  I guess my last hope is RobinHood community. They love Tesla.Yes, that's what I am hoping and the new factory and battery. Long term, so don't mind waiting but also don't want to wait forever.As I said, i am learning and I want to be a trader. I am not crying or complaining of buying it expensive. 

And trading or investing is a personal decision. Thanks for your 2 cents.You should not be giving advice about what to do with their money.Why would I need your guarantee? I didn't ask for your assurance?. Somehow people here are happy if you loose money.  What a sorry sorry bunch of people.Sorry, I replied to this. I actually thought this post was in r/wallstreetbetsThey are on track for an S&P500 listing. There will be no sell off, only buy up.Where did I say I was trying to time dips? I don't try to time them and never have.

I said I buy when dips happen, that's it. Did you even read my comment?For context, I’m 18 just graduated high school. I was already planning on moving out, but COVID sure fucked up school itself. I’m hoping that everyone would be better for second semester, or at least for summer classes but I’m fine with first semester because the stuff actually related to my major is software stuff for my first class(ME major) so a bit hard learning online but better than in person rn.oh stop it drama queen. The VIX didn't even get near the 79 that it reached in 08' (it topped out at 66 in march). It's bad, but it isn't Lehmann brothers and bear sterns liquidating, bad.AAPL had GOOD news? LMAO. Dude, do you watch any financial news? All they talked about today was BAD news for AAPL. Why do you think it dropped so much?

I owned XLK. QQQ outperformed it and recovered quicker after the drop and pays a dividend. Sold my XLK to buy more QQQThat makes sense to me! Thank you very much friend. Definitely gonna look into both of themDo you see arkk dropping more?I’m new to this as well, how much is to much to invest into XLK? What do you use to trade? I’m currently using Robin Hood but I’ve heard a mix of things. Any help is appreciated!the point i was making is that if you are sitting around with cash specifically to have it ready for a crash you really did not achieve that much since the returns you get from having that money in the market tends to outpace the what you gain by waiting for a crash. Or to put it another way if the market gain 8% on average and the crash is for 30% after 10 years  you missed out on 115% growth or 50% growth after the crash. that is before we consider timing risks because you probably won't buy the bottom.Exactly. Antibodies form extremely unreliable and only a few of the infected got them. A vaccine usually takes 2-8 years of time. Currently every scientist whose able to work on it is working on it but stuff like this is taking time. Thats just how science works.Ah, you are talking long term. That makes sense.That’s what they said about Enron. It was a blue chip stock, Arthur Andersen was a part of the big 5. Both went defunct in the same scandal. 

Lehman brothers - huge investing bank, too big to fail, gone with the 2008 crisis.

I agree, it’s not likely but it’s also not impossible.It took me until I was 40 something (like last year, I think). My own ignorance never fails to surprise me.There’s also a sizable portion (perhaps most) of the US population that literally can’t spare $500/mo to invest. It’s not just a lack of knowledge, but a lack of capital.Yes, I mean I’m incredibly lucky to have parents that saved and can pay for my college and to have a well-paying internship despite COVID. Very very lucky. Not everybody, or even most people, have that so I can’t begrudge them. But I think it’s important to teach the fundamentals of compound interest and saving at a young age, and I think we still lack that in the U.S.Assuming markets increase in value significantly over those 20 years. There is no guarantee of that.But to have an American bank account I need to be american, right? Or live in the US?Perhaps youre not familiar with Portnoy... he chose to publicly shame his ex all over his website. He got his troll army to attack her instructor’s place of work. They made t-shirts and they had a catch phrase. THAT’s weird.

https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/the-barstool-sports-founder-got-cucked-and-its-everyones-fault-but-his-ownNow 1420...Not to put you down or anything, but I sold last week in 1500. And my good with my decision. I'm not saying you should sell, noone knows what happens, but definitely don't buy more right now.
Personally I think it will dip to 1000 before making progress again, but clearly I have no idea.90% of traders lose money. If you really want to be in that 10%, go for it. Personally, I think you're insane if you think you can beat the algorithms (do you even know what I mean when I say that?)>"That is, no single stock should exceed 5% of your capital.

>An extremely risk adverse portfolio also avoids big gains."

So, all those AAPL and KO shares just magically appeared in his holdings? lmaoLose* and no, i don't want you to lose money. I'm simply implying that if you continue to trade pump and dump penny stocks that you'll eventually lose.> when

That's timing, dude.  You don't know its a dip at the moment.I see. I'm in my late 20s and just so you're aware a LOT of us in my generation (tail end of Millennials) really regret our decisions when it comes to paying incredible amounts of money for degrees that didn't really produce a lot of opportunities. Comp Sci stuff is probably a good bet, but you also have to think about how that is also what so many other people are also doing, and a lot of them at a way higher level than you might be. I got my degree in Physics with a Mathematics minor. I was in the top 5% of my class at a major US university, a member of plenty of honors societies, 3.98 GPA, did research every summer, etc. And I still couldn't find a job in the field after looking for over a year because the job market was so saturated with people who had Masters Degrees and PhDs. BS degrees were simply not valuable, regardless of the qualifications.

I'm not discouraging you from going to college of course, but my advice would be to just be careful when it comes to student loans and money in general over the next 5 years. It's very easy right now to get into some serious debt, but you never know what's going to happen and that can hang over you for decades. I've been lucky to have been able to pay it off pretty consistently, but it really does suck just knowing it's there. I have family that are still paying off student loans 20 years later, and that was when college was cheap.

We were your age during the Great Recession and we still haven't recovered from it. Just look at home ownership, marriage, and birth rates among people in their late 20s and 30s. It's very possible your generation might go through what we did and are still, and maybe even to a greater extent. 

Just try to be smart and don't make any quick decisions. Again, best of luck.If I was coming fresh out of high school I would go this semester because you will be taking mostly gen ed classes anyways.  Just knock some of those out online.  But that’s mei'm not smart or expirienced enough to give a qualified opinion there... i honestly don't know. i bough in here because i figure if it does go down more it won't be a ton and this seemed like a safe place to buy and should swing as soon tesla starts swinging back up....which it will after yesterday's earnings report. 

thats about as much advice as i am comfortable giving .. just in case im really wrong ill feel bad because its not my money youre working with.

i felt good about buying here... i'll leave it at that. (because honestly i don't know lol)Buffet has lots cash and he never time market so you have no idea what you talking aboutIt’s just a stupid delusion imo and too many people have it. They think a vaccine is here by end of August. I don’t understand this type of logic. I thought I knew more about science than stocks anyways but I wanna know what these guys know that I don’tMy 401k and ira are longterm. Etfs and indexs i get into for decade plus are long term. Im talking 2 yearsWell yeah nothing is outside the realm of possibility.   But I cant see the aforementioned stocks going back down to where they were early march without an even more extreme world event than the covid.  We had that nasty dip a few weeks ago and that will probably be the bottom of the market for a while.Well, also, Enron and Lehman aren't even comparable to something like McDonald's or Walmart.

Lehman was based almost entirely on investing so dangerous itself.

Enron didn't even last 2 decades before it collapsed over fake budgets.

Again, no one is saying impossible, but anything like that happening with McDonald's is probably next to nothing.

If McDonald's dies, it'll likely be seen ahead of time.Better late than never.well I can’t spare $500/ month to invest so I’m not sure I see your point. Shouldn’t matter if it’s $50 or $500 the principle of compounding remains the sameNot necessarily, It depends where you live.

I would look into it man;

 Here, I posted a link that specify's the deets:

All cheaters deserved to be shamed publicly.I will treat it as a total write off ad leave it there i guess. Eventually stock price will get there.Genius, just because you're doing it for longer,  you don't have the right to judge me.  I thought I wrote it in ENGLISH that I am "LEARNING". If I lose, it will be my money, Do you have a problem with that?  

And if that only 10 % are successful,  then yes, I will be one of the 10% with time.  I already said thanks for your 2 cents.  Don't need any more penny from you.You should read my comment history a little closer next time.Buffet buys companies, not stocks.*spelling mistake happens when you quickly type on a phone. 

All pennystock are not pump and dump.

Follow news, look for a catalyst for a stock to go up and invest when there are indicators for a move.

But thanks for your 2 cents....Investing money at anything but completely arbitrary moments in time is wrong. 

Okay, thanks for the advice!Trust me I’ve seen it it’s all over Reddit. Yeah I’m doing mechanical engineering and I’m pretty confident I can get me a decent job with that at least because the Major itself is pretty broad. But I’m gonna work my ass off because as a first gen college student son of two immigrants who didn’t even go to middle school. I’m already setting milestones so I’m just trying to get rich really, but like in a good way. And stocks are part of that journey but I wasted a lot the past few months on penny stocks. I’m still learning them but I’m not stupid about it anymore and because of my class schedule I can’t have an actual job My first semester so I’ll be studying a lot about stocks as well.Buffet doesn't buy stocks.It’s Trump just lying in everyone’s faces until they believe it. Trump is the man in power but he won’t fuel the market forever. He can buy as many ‘‘vaccines‘‘ as he wants, he fucked up big time. Im sitting here waiting for the winter, quarantine number 2 is coming at least for the US. More and more people will loose their jobs worldwide. Big factories will close and there will still be no vaccine. Just wear your masks and stay inside while the economy is going down the drain. But that’s how our system works and unfortunately we can’t do anything about it.> down to where they were early march without an even more extreme world event than the covid

Or, hear me out here.  They do what is called a "market correction" and finally properly account for the extreme world event that is covid, and that is set to erase $9T from global GDP this year.  Stocks are way, way overvalued right now.  
  
Because there is so much liquidation and free money everywhere, that investors literally have nowhere else to try to hold their wealth.Even if I’m 28? Also, are we talking like a Roth over a 401k? Or separate Roth on top of a 401k? If the first, I thought it’s supposed to be better to do 401k because an employer can contribute more of a match to a 401k.Thank you, I'll look into it!Remember when you contradicted yourself simply because you're a weird Portnoy Stan? First you say it was weird that the public cared about personal issues and then followed that up with "cheaters need to be publicly shamed", wow... that was dumb.Considering you have no idea if the guy was aware she wasn't single, that logic is extra dumb.I believe so too. When I bought I was confident in a 4000$ value in maybe 10 years. That is why I bought. Seeing how it surged so fast is mere luck and caused by speculation imo. But it will get there!What's your penny stock of choice?> Investing money at anything but completely arbitrary moments in time is wrong.

This is correct, despite your useless sarcasm.  You buy a stock because you believe in the fundamentals, and you intend to hold it in the long term.   
  
You can twiddle your thumbs while you wait for the "dip".  Meanwhile, tomorrow, or next week, the stock might move above where it is today and never return.  
  
As I said, your attempt to time the dips is only fooling yourself.  This has been proven over and over again across many investors trades.If you're majoring in mechanical engineering...you're gonna be all set my dude 👌🏾 (sincerely).


I looked into that major because the starting salary is high/theres a large demand,

and holy shit theres so much math.
its like you're life becomes math for a few years just to get through that major (hours a day studying equations and doing practice problems..)

When it comes to that Major..if I may quote Oscar from the 90's Nikolodian cartoon "Hey Arnold": 

"Susie, you can keep the money."-That's awesome. I'm sure your parents are going to be very proud of you. 

But yeah don't do penny stocks. So you're going to college and your expenses are about to skyrocket. Just regularly put money into index funds like VOO/VTI, maybe 5-10% in bonds like BND or BLV, and if you want some tech do VGT. Sure, it's not a sexy way to invest, but it is a **smart** way to invest. No, you're not going to make thousands of dollars like people who invested in Tesla did years ago. But you'll make consistent returns while minimizing risk over decades. This is what investing means.

I know it's hard to accept such a boring thing because you want to "get rich" but trust me you're not Warren Buffet. Getting "rich" from the market takes YEARS of spending every single day of your life studying companies and stocks. Do you have that time and energy? I don't think so.

You're going to college, not imitating Buffet. Put some money into index funds every month and forget about it. Spend your time learning and work your ass off with your education. Don't worry about the stock market.I agree there will be a correction coming. Probably the end of this year through much of next year.  Real estate is going to be massacred most likely.   I was speaking more in terms of the next few months.   But you can always buy and hold blue chip stocks and usually outperform people who think they can time the market.  You might have to hold through some ugly times but itll work out long termDo both if you can but the employer match is free money so I'd go for that first. I actually started Roth IRA around your age and have been contributing every year since then.I'll give you one for today - ABUS (Moved crazy pre market) .

Indicator: it won a lawsuit against Moderna.So you have 100% of your portfolio in equities at all times? You hold zero cash or any other positions? 

Because if what you're saying is correct why would you ever hold anything other than equities?

I hold cash as savings but it's also there to buy in the event there's a dip. It's not money I would otherwise be investing at this point. I have no idea why you are so ornery about this. Everyone does it.

I have never claimed to be trying to time the market. I have no idea why you keep saying that I have (are you drunk or something?). 

In any case this is my last response to you, your comments are very boring. 

I wish you the best.That's not a penny stock. They are a half billion dollar company listed on the Nasdaq> I hold cash as savings but it's also there to buy in the event there's a dip.

> I have never claimed to be trying to time the market.   
  
Ok there guy.You are insufferableLol and there's a reason why you didn't answer any of my questions. 


Goodnight buddy!Thank you, I have no idea what this guy's problem with me is.Gg to the people who bought puts on it a few months agobut im wearing my magic satin shortsThank god this happened though!!!

I just want it to go down like $1100-$1200...please and I’ll make my move.That is a bit dramatic don't you think? TSLA swings by large percentage regularly and the whole market is down/sideways for 2ish years now. FWIW I bought in around 1600 as well, might add a few more shares if it drops again.COVID funding is going to be cut next week.  I think that is when the bubble will pop.The pimple on the butt of the stock markets has been popped!StopIts prob just ppl taking their profits. Ppl are still hype abt it going into s&p500 and it will be a self fulfilling prophecyGot in at the bottom. Not selling sorry.itll be under 1000 within a month then i may buyBased on? Because there is a second shoulder pattern that is starting to look like the first on their 1 year chart? When was that first shoulder pattern? March? Was there some kind of black swan event in March that could have caused that first drop that has nothing to do with the Tesla stock price?If tesla perfects battery technology  its way more than a car comlany you'll see it be worth trillionsTesla cooked their Q2 books.  Look it up.

Tesla = EnronI'm salivating to buy more.If they bought puts a few months ago their puts are probably worth -99.9% right nowyou better like it at 500-600 bucks then lolIt was at $1200 three weeks ago, why didn't you make your move then? Yeah, 'cause you're just talking shit.Short the stock if you think it'll go down then. A real investor once told me the real players make money on the up as well as on the down.Are you referring to their sale of environmental credits to increase profit?Well I meant more like the last monthI’d fucking love that - I highly doubt it will EVER go down low like that ever againLol. I wish, but not gonna happen.The whole world will be jumping in for this.A stock trading at it's ATH and a 233 P/E ratio is not the same as one that has previously seen people paying $367 for earnings and dropped to $233. A few weeks ago there was still a question of major index inclusion as well. I know it doesn't seem like it most of the time but it is possible for investors to change their opinion due to new information.It was there 3 months ago, and before that 8 months ago.

I sell when my allocation exceeds 7.5 and I buy when it drops below 7.5MaybeWhich one would you recommend is a buy now?nvda tsm amd

edit: is what I assumeI'm not the right person to ask tbh. Above, I was mainly arguing two points:

- NVidia is not necessarily overvalued (or even "fully" valued) just on the basis that they crossed above Intel's market cap because the eventual total addressable market for CPUs (within SoCs with various accelerators) might be much larger than the current x86 market (which companies such as NVidia (and others) *could* eventually disrupt, absorb and take from Intel).

- If indeed Intel's difficulties continue, then I don't see this as just 100% bullish on AMD ie it could just lead to an overall decline in the x86 market (and therefore I think we should really pay heed to Apple switching to ARM).

Nowhere am I not acknowledging that AMD also makes ARM-based SoCs, that's just not the vector that people usually use to make forecasts about AMDs future (rather, they have their eyes on Intel's current revenues).

Having said all that, my own cost basis for my NVDA shares is $139.50 (man do I envy the people who got in at $20). I would absolutely buy a lot more if we saw the stock fall substantially (e.g. to somewhere near $200). Not probable, but not impossible either given how volatile the stock is. The stock is very expensive, so I would not get into a large position at the current levels. But if I had to buy one of them, I'd buy NVDA. Important to emphasize however that I invest for the long term (think 5 years from now and longer). If you look at NVidia as a company, they've had some good luck historically, but they are a terrific company with a great track record.

INTC (although you probably didn't ask about INTC), I might still buy INTC if it falls substantially (say we see a price close to $30). Despite their difficulties, they can always turn around and e.g. Altera alone is worth a lot as a business.

AMD, I have no idea. I don't trade, but if I did, then maybe the "short INTC, long AMD" trade has some runway left still. Like I said, long term, I am not bullish on x86 servers (and certainly not desktop) anymore. But short term, if Intel's difficulties persist, who knows how long that trade could last.Seriously?  Nvidia at $139 and intel at 30?   You may have to wait for a long time, most likely forever.Either your a realtor or reading the numbers wrong.  Either way home sales are down 11.3% year over.

The rise is shocking. This is one I do not understandMost realtors now use ***eSign, iSign, AdobeSign***. There are several other products that are on free trial for real estate professionals. Docu Sign has a difficult interface on multi-personal >3 persons people use the first 3 for real estate, title signatures.

Did a survey awhile back out of 20 real estate professionals only 3(15%) paid for Docu Sign rest use other eSign signs most are paid by someone else for less.  The Docum Notary if practical is a good product.

Why is this even on the market?Nothing could’ve prepared me for a post about cauliflower in this sub todayAlot of people are clowning on you but I think its a unique question. Like anything, cauliflower could be the next big thing for food or just a temporary trend. Still a good question[removed]Buy cauliflower farmFarms won't be on the stock market. You would need to look at stuff like birds eye or other sellers and see if they are being publicly traded on the stock market.

 You could also privately buy in to something but that is a little harder often. A lot of farmers around me allow you to buy into the crops when they plant and you get a percentage of profit when they sell but that would require you to know farmers probably.Start wrestling and you can grow your investment on your ear.

But seriously, directly you can go with cauliflower futures contracts (don't even know if this is a traded commodity to be honest). Or indirectly, look at businesses that will be adding cauliflower related products to their offerings. The impact of this to overall stock price will be debatable though.

$LAND, Gladstone Land, investor presentation [here](https://ir.gladstoneland.com/static-files/2c525ba0-7dee-43a3-b13d-1f024cccd471)

It's a farmland REIT. Now, I don't believe they own any cauliflower farms directly, but they do specialize in non-row crops. So think either permanent crops (almonds, pecans, etc) and speciality annual crops (think strawberries, lettuce, etc). Basically fresh produce and nuts, rather than grains, which the other farmland REIT $FPI, specializes in.

While LAND might not have cauliflower directly:

1) tenants could potentially convert current farmland to cauliflower production if the trend continues. It shouldn't be hard to convert a lettuce farm to cauliflower if demand for the latter booms enough to offset switching costs. 

2) the value of the underlying farmland increases indirectly from a cauliflower boom. Remember much of the value of a farm isn't necessarily from the crop it produces but the underlying dirt, the capability of production. Even if Gladstone doesn't convert to any cauliflower production, if a bunch of cauliflower produces start buying up land to produce cauliflower, it should indirectly bid up the value of Gladstone's assets as the supply of farmland decreases.I grow broccoli for a living in California and this post killed me....it's a fad

Impossible Foods is privately held but $YUM may also be a good bet as well as $CAG if you want to cover production. something to consider is that the consumer market may not react well to lab-grown meat for a while, but that doesn't mean it can't be used in things like pet food and animal-based products such as makeup, hygiene  or skincare products as well.

Ok jokes asside investing in farms is kinda none existent as far as I've seen. Most farms are private, and a lot are family owned. Instead of buying stocks, maybe consider buying farmland if you have the money, and if you want to use it to farm to a lot of research and find someone who's actually well versed in agriculture. Don't do it unless you have a bit of fall back money, and can get a loan. Do note, farming will have a slow build up. It'll take time to get money back on the investment, but it'll make a lot later on.

Never said it wasn’t a good oneLOL what world do you live in where 17 year olds have cash to buy even a single share of TSLA?Whats your point? Those kids would have made a lot of moneyTo be honest I though my friend was crazy when he said people ate kale regularly now. I was a 90s kid working fast food and the only thing I thought it was used for was as a garnish or decoration around food bars. I didn't think people actually ate it.And the funny thing is that its [all the same fucking plant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassica_oleracea). Cabbages, kale, cauliflowers,  broccoli, etc.My actual kale shorts: 🩳Its picking up, cauliflower rice is starting to get mainstream in the last year or so costco is selling a pack o 2 frozen cauliflower crust pizza for $15. (regular frozen is ~$10 for 4 pack)Glad I didn’t have to scroll far to find it. I am certain TC will take off in the coming monthsTypo on the ticker (or I guess that was intentional )Right. It will not be impossible.cauli is lit, famalamCauliflower is the next hot commodityI don't know what they call it but I live out in the country and you can buy into a crop for a percentage of what the farmer earns at selling. My fil earns side income doing this. My grandmother used to earn income by selling a percentage of the crop before it was planted. If you google it you might be able to find something about it.Depends if you use headgear. I have a little bit in both ears, never used headgear for wrestling or BJJ."This will be worth a fortune past the expiration date!"I did not say "Give me a lot of cauliflower". I said "Give me all the cauliflower you have".

\- Yuppie Ron SwansonNo he was dialing the phone 500 times a dayMy thoughts exactly. Thought the cauliflower rage ended 5 years ago. We eat and grow a tonne where I’m from but don’t see demand increasing dramatically..Want to buy some cauliflower? I got myself a truckload when I heard the rumours.keto maybeketo diet.

My GF only eats pizza this way.   in fact we found a place close by that has this type of crust so she had pizze for the first time in years.

If you've ever heard of MOD pizza they let you choose cauliflower crust pizza for an extra $2. It's delicious and I get it every time. Much tastier than the thick, chewy doughGluten free pizza is higher in calories than traditional dough typically which are both really high. A slice of pizza is going to run you around 300 calories so for a normal female they could eat around 4 to 5 slices and be over calories for the full day. 

A cauliflower dough will be significantly less calories and much lower on carbohydrates which is what most people are trying to limit. Especially low fiber high carb foods like dough.Which is amazing 😃You ever hear about that start up Tesla? My neighbor got the car and it’s greatWhatWhen I eat kale, I feel like someone has accidentally left some product's paper wrapper in my salad.Its just a broccoli variantCauliflower is just broccoli's shittier cousin.I have a tortoise, and he loves itLol ok u tell me how to exploit a fad vegetable as an individual investorUsername checks out.the type of ice they're on?Yep, AGM is Farmer Mac. AGM offers a near 5% dividend yield and has been achieving 10+% CAGR over the past decade. Their delinquency rate never even went above 0.1% even during the Great Recession. Their loans are as solid as they come. An added benefit is that the U.S. government has always subsidized farming and made sure that farmers can afford their loans/equipment/machinery and make a living because it's such an integral component of our economy. I think AGM is a great way to play the financial sector if you want to minimize riskWhat season and episode number?Is it a newer episode?

I think genetics play a big role.buying calls on literal cauliflowers hmuAh, makes sense. I'm gluten intolerant for some reason (happened randomly in my late 20s) I hate those cauliflower pizzas! Believe it or not, tapioca is where it's at for gluten-free pizza crust. Nothing beats good old wheat though... I miss itBut can you imagine pineapple on cauliflower crust pizza? Pass.I found the secret — very finely chopping it.

Then you mix it with mixed salads or spinach.

You can also use it with soups (finely chopped) or pan grilled (the problem here is the water it releases).Can’t eat Brocoli pizza, Cauli pizza is tastyI'm growing 10 kale plants in my back yard.

Can you?"Wait, It's all cabbage"

"Always has been"Cauliflower pizza was ok.. I guess I could develop a taste for it if I wanted too. However, the nutritional info didn't seem to be that great so I thought it was probably better to having a smaller portion of a regular pizza than the overpriced cauliflower one. Then again, I don't have a tesla but still have their shares since 4 out of 7 of my close friends have one.Thank you. I do believe it is cropshare is the word I couldn't think of.Have you been training since February/March?

Yeah i am not a fan of the Cauliflower crust either.  

But i did try it and told her it was "pretty good" while she was enjoying it LOL! 

To be fair it was better than i thought it would be.  i just dont like cauliflower persaonlly.

ther place put so much galric and butter in it you could barley taste it.I dont think I would enjoy cauliflower pizza tbh so thats a hard pass for sure 😋And Kale is excellent in smoothies.Kale is so easy to grow more people should do itYou were the person that used the word "dumb" not me sirWait.  Did you set up this account just in case you ever got the opportunity to tell this joke?That sounds like a massive downgrade.You have to get a special co-sign from your parent or guardian, but yes you can.yeah and you can't drink alcohol before 21 eitherI think the move is against the gluten/carb industry. Not towards cauliflower. Like buy tesla not because its tesla and its all the fad, buy it because the car industry sucks and fossil fuel is old news.I have been training. I already got Covid so I'm immune to catching it or spreading it againWell, liquefied kale opens up a wealth of opportunities including vegetable broths, smoothies, sauces (especially with roasted pine nuts, olive oil, & garlic), and for use when making pasta (instead of water, use kale juice).Actually no, just an amazing opportunity lolThat's because it is, tried every damn version of the shit I can find at the grocery store and have even made my own. 

Just like all the 'meat substitutes' that one annoying vegan/vegatarian friend everyone has that tries convincing them it tastes JuSt LikE tHe ReaL tHiNG! Fucking lies, the only way you'd think it does is if you haven't had the real thing in forever and forgot what it tastes like.

Tastes like shit, has a shit texture and cosplay cauliflower just ruins whatever it's in.

If it's anything like how long it took to get Beyond Meat we're gunna have to wait 20-30 years before we got a cauliflower version of food that doesn't taste like licking a glory hole.I didn’t have to do that back in the Etrade days. 16 and investing in Elan.much like the dark side of investing; it's only illegal if you get caught. ;-)Why can’t you?You can definitely still spread it FYI, and I’m pretty sure no one knows wether or not you can contract it a second time. Correct me if I’m wrong on that last partIt's the law and if it's the law it's impossible to do itIt won't survive inside the body because of the immunity. It dies outside of the body relatively quickly as well. 

My father is a medical professional and works in the Covid unit at a relatively well known hospital. He's told me they haven't seen anything other than anecdotal evidence that suggest you can catch it twice.You can get shipped away for war, but you can’t even have a beer or a cig.Sorry, but while your father is right in the short term, he is overall incorrect.   We know some can "catch it" twice, like every virus.  What we don't know is how many, and how long antibodies last in those that develop immunity.  It could be that antibodies last forever, or it could be that they only last something like 90 days.God bless americaBut this guys father who is a medical professional at *one* hospital says *he* hasn’t seen anything other than anecdotal evidence. You must be wrong

Alaskans don’t want it and it’s right next to the largest Salmon run in the world, which makes up most of Alaska’s industryI heard some smart guy say “why would I hold a mine with all the overhead and liabilities when I could just own the mineral” he was taking about gold specifically.

Often, the best content is free. You just need to know where to look for it. I follow some market technicians on twitter and have learned most of what I know from them. It might seem strange, but having a good following list on Twitter can go a long way.

SeekingAlpha is a pretty great website. Some articles are behind a paywall but there's always some good free reads too.

I like that their covid vaccine is trivalent and may be flexible enough to cover mutations but at this point we don't know how effective these later COVID vaccines will be.  Their Hep b vaccine will prob be good for them as well. I've held since it was less than 2 bucks a share.Hey thanks for the reply, appreciate it. When do you think it will start picking up again, perhaps in august when they give readouts on some of their vaccines? I’ve seen some people here and there saying the stock belongs in the teens and 20s, but to me that seems a long way away. What do you think?I bought a sizeable portion of amd  10 minutes before the news hit. Better to be lucky then skilled I guess.It really hurts to hold Intel today. I understand the bear case but I never imagined that I would see it drop below my cost basis. Despite the headwinds, the selloff seems a bit overzealous. Hopefully investors see value and buy up some of the dip.I picked up a sizeable portion around 49.90, leveraged too so a bit jittery.Nice drop. Bought in at 51.Got in today at $50But... their data centre revenue is going through the roof by the looks of it. Maybe Intel will just pump more resources into that area moving forward.GreatCurrently I don’t own any shares in Intel (have positions in Nvidia, Skyworks and Lam Research). If the stock drops below $50, is this a good entry point? Do you guys think it has the potential to grow in the next 5 years?Giving up on manufacturing their own chips is kinda scary. I don't own any INTC but it's weird seeing them fall so hard today after being the market leader for so many years. 

[https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-shares-dive-apparent-manufacturing-165335985.html](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-shares-dive-apparent-manufacturing-165335985.html)I feel like I married this piece of shit now 

I took a shot yesterday and grabbed some, I don’t even want to hold them - maybe I’ll sell it and eat the 15% lossHmm 16% off seems like a bargain - but the commentary I'm seeing says that they've got broader problems competing with AMD's products and so forth so I'll mull it over and decide whether or not to buy todayAmd 65 strikes just went in the money 🤑🤑🤑Yeah. I got a lot of hell yesterday for not being bullish before they reported.They wiped out my whole week. Dammit.AMD is standing on Intel with a bootI guess AMD would react positively to this news. It’s time to hop into AMD I believeBought some shares today. Long term investment in Intel sounds good to me.IDK, they basically can't be cost/margin competitive long term if they don't get more volume for their fabs. That's why they had to acquire altera and why they have to make a GPU and why they were pushing atom/edison/iot and all those tiny video accell chips. It's desperation.Same, not sure how it’ll do but I saw that $10 dip and figured it could be worth trying outRipNot great for someone like me who has a decent amount of cash in $INTC.  Been invested for almost 2.5 years with a long term plan.

Up 30% since that time, but if it truly drops to $52 today then my unrealized gains will cut in half.I’m torn. Now that I see the premarket projections, I wish I had sold 50% of my position yesterday.

Now I’m wondering if I should double down on my position as a value investor.

Clearly I was ill-prepared for this news and never developed an exit strategy as such.It has potential to grow but maybe not until end of 2021 bc that’s when they release their new chip. That being said by then that new chip will already be outdated by amd’s so intel will be playing catch-up for a while, meanwhile amd eat’s most of the market place.I agree, 16% does sound like a bargain, but I’d their future guidance is very weak, the public perception of the CEO is bad, and the delayed chip innovation and sales are delayed by over a year - when will we see the return?

I’m very hesitant to buy more stock unless it falls below my cost basis ($46.16), at which point it will be to average down.I'd strongly recommend against that, Intel's been poached to the bone due to the current cunts in charge. The comp is garbage, all the good engineers have jumped shipt to apple/google/nvidia/amd/brcm as have all the execs/leads that had any operational/strategic excellence and it's fucking impossible to do anything because all the internal tooling/equipment is fucking garbage. Like get this, the standard laptop they hand out to eng a few years ago was like a 1366x768, dual core 2.4 ghz, 4 gb ram, 80 gb ssd thick ass HP piece of shit that could barely run open two word docs and a browser or editor without becoming a super lag fest. And god forbid it stopped working for whatever reason because you'd have to go though some fucking useless ass outsourced IT that didn't know shit, couldn't do shit but who you had to go through to to get an approval which then allowed you to submit a request 2-3 levels up your fucking chain to get replaced.

Fuck those fuckers.Yes agree, planning to buy if it drop below 50Yikes, at 50.7 nowI don’t think anyone saw that coming. Otherwise, no one would be losing any money. Intel has so much potential and is more than capable to compete. They need to make several important changes. It’s the largest chip company in the world which is slowly losing to so many other much smaller companies.wow I didn't realize all of that. What stock would you recommend instead?They fucked up with holding off on their next chip[this](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/guji5e/rate_my_portfolio_rstocks_quarterly_thread_june/fyr394z/) + 600 KTOS is my portfolioThe question is “what are the going to do to fix this big issue?” How are they planning on beating AMD? I personally think that AMD has a way better chance of reaching $100 price tag much faster than Intel.I will give them a look, thank you!Why do you like KTOS?I forgot but I read somewhere that Intel is spreading its resources thin without a clear path to the future where as AMD is more focused on what they are trying to accomplish in the future. And in that sense I believe amd is the better of the two at this point.>The question is “what are the going to do to fix this big issue?” 

It sounds like the answer might be outsourcing their production (even CEO Bob Swan said they might consider it). Intel has famously built their chips in-house for 30 years, but that may need to change if they are looking to compete with AMD.For Intel, it's not just about beating amd.

Intel already dominated consumer and server cpu market share, there wasn't much potential growth beyond that of the market. Their struggle now is to diversify beyond into high growth markets they don't own, like ai, gpus.

This issue with AMD CPUs is just compounding on their existing risk with diversification. And their foundry expertise falling behind is even worse.Vertically integration for low-ish cost drones, stand off munitions and associated infrastructure but not stupid enough to keep it all in house. They might become a major supplier of small or medium sized drones and missiles in a decade or so.Agreed! It’s very hard to bet against AMD at this point. They clearly know what they are doing. BUT with all the current major sell offs, I am leaning towards growing my exit position in Nvidia. I think this company is great and it’s leadership is phenomenal. I believe they are well positioned to fully benefit from AI and 5G.Agree. I heard someone was referring to Nvidia, AMD and other chip companies using Taiwan Semiconductor as their manufacturer. That’s why I like Lam research.Interesting, no denying that is the way the world is going so definitely going to look into them more. Sucks that they just had a big jump, I hate buying into things after stuff like that :PI agree nvidia has been the industry leader in chips for quite a while now. Can’t go wrong with them. But I also feel amd always seems to be closing in on both of them. Much more upside to meI missed it too :( sold a puts on it instead of buying FML.AMD is a very company company which specializes in its specific niche and they are very successful in it. Nvidia is trying to diversify its revenue streams. What do you think of Synopsys, Cadence, Lam research and KLA?heh, I am a lot more basic then that. I don't fuck around with puts/calls/options. Way above my league. I just buy and rarely sell :PNot familiar with thoseSolid companies. Take a look and let me know what you think 😉After all the TSLA posts, I see why you posted this. Good info.What do you mean we have to pay attention to IV and theta decay?!?!?So many “I lost money someone help plz” postsThanks mod. Wiki is hard to find on mobile.

Edit: thanks a second time for the other sticky you posted with the full wiki links!If you're spending money trading options and do not know this you are an idiot. No offense.This lesson only cost me 18k to learnLol. Did you buy your option before corporate earnings?Bummer... I considered myself a well educated individual with strong comprehension skills but I have no fucking clue what I just read lolThis is called "vol crush."You mean ppl go in their platform and see delta, gamma, theta and  vega displayed, and ignore all of that????????Saved this - thanks again!Lol when people ignore the theta factor in options tradingNice work9Lol theta gang always winsWould you still want to buy your contract at your current price?

Uhhhhhh only if you're interesting in making moneyBe a net seller and you would not have to worry about theta decay as muchPersonally I get a kick out of poking fun of the lazies who cant be bothered to google stuff, but the community frowns upon such behavior.You're welcome.The best way to learn is by losing money!There are plenty of ways to spend money foolishly. You can't possibly know it all before you start trading just like an apprentice can't know it all before he becomes a journeyman. Mistakes while costly, make you learn along the way.Ya but the dd had 🚀. How could I lose money?I'll take critique towards improvement.    

Added at the top: 

Every option trader needs to understand what extrinsic value is,   
and how it is interpreted (implied volatility),   
how it can go away quickly (IV crush),  
 and also it goes away slowly (theta decay).How long have you been trading options?Not fully your fault, it’s not written very wellA lot of new traders do not know what the greeks mean.Some times on shitty platforms it doesnt show that. You have to dig for itAre the ppl who write the contracts considered theta gang? Since they collect all the premiums and essentially win the money lost to theta?what's the risk of being in theta gang?In my opinion this is just as dumb as the questions this post is referring to. Sure, selling for theta works if the underlying moves in your favor, just like *every other fucking strategy*.

The problem is it’s really difficult to make sustainable money selling unless IV is high. When IV is high, the stock tends to move. What happens when it moves? If it’s in the direction against you, you get crushed by delta. Your $30 contract price could be hovering around $45 for weeks, and you hope that it stops moving against you and theta catches up shortly before expiration. Where as if you would’ve purchased that contract, you could’ve made a quick 50% gain with a small move of the underlying.

Please stop acting like you are smarter or know something people don’t by selling options.. it’s all a net zero gain when averaged out statistically unless you find a tiny, tiny repeatable edge.No!! That’s why I’m trying to sell it!!
😂From what I’ve seen on reddit most people are not interested in that, lol.Wait, I thought if you lose money you’re actually winning? Something about tax credit.Frowning with intelligent advice is fine. Lone frowning just seems mean.Learned my first lesson in FOMO this week with AstraZeneca. :) Will do my best not to make the same mistake again.Also not the only way!but it’s like becoming a welder without knowing that fire is hotIt’s like driving a car and not knowing how to change gears. 
Some things you just gotta study before you engage with them, and if you don’t, you’re setting yourself up for failure.I'm not that guy, but I can say, as someone here more as a spectator rather than someone actively engaged in options trading, there were several points where I was following, and then you mentioned some term I didn't recognize as an aside, and you lost me in those moments.

Generally, I got the gist. What is missing for me, as a newbie to all of this, is a clear picture of whether we're talking calls or puts, long or short - I feel like we're talking about all of those scenarios, or at least the long scenarios, I'm less certain about shorts, but sometimes you mention extrinsic value rising or falling, and I'm not certain if we're discussing calls or puts, and in the money or out of the money, etc, at any given moment when you're talking about how extrinsic value will behave.Agreed. 

In the end, if you do not understand intrinsic and extrinsic value, you don't understand the true risk in your portfolio.

If you do then you sleep pretty well at night.Approximately.....never. Have been lurking about for a little while and thought this post would be a good learning opportunity. Felt dumb after reading it and posted a comment. Judging by the downvotes, I've made a grave mistake, my apologies.Particular critique towards reshaping invited. 

 It was written two years ago for other purposes, and modified.Yes theta gang collects the premium and they win if the move is less then expected.  The expected move for Tesla yesterday was like 200 points so theta gang won.

“Expected move” here is simply due to the implied volatility.  IV is always very high right before earnings because the moves are usually expected to be relatively big, but theta gang believes expected moves are greater than actual moves on the aggregate and that’s one of the things they count onThe theta gang is more like insrance underwriters.The stock goes against you big timenand you have to eat it.You actually might have to buy or sell stocks at worse prices than the market, but if you're okay holding a stock you believe in, then you might sell covered calls when you end up buying the stock via a cash covered put.Wow someone woke up in a bad mood today. It's kind of a joke. This phrase is said a lot. Sorry, I prefer higher chance to profit, low risk, and low reward strategies when it comes to options. I don't use margin or sell naked options. All my risk is defined in all my trades. Please stop acting like you are smarter or know something that people don't by giving a condescending, low-key rude reply to a joke comment. Hope you feel better today!Oh, they might be interested, but qualified ? Most notThey deserve it for spamming posts.  There really isn’t a need for 100 posts that are answered in the FAQ.The market is mean, I’m just here to toughen them up. Maybe they’d stop HTZ stock if someone was tough on themHe didn't dismiss the risk. He is asking why it happened.OK, good points.  

Extrinsic value will increase or decrease,  
 whether long or short, call or put.    
In one sense it does not matter.   

The undiscussed topic is that the   
extrinsic value increases (good for longs / bad for shorts)  
or decreases  (good for short options / bad for longs)  
do to gains. 

It was drafted to be able to talk about all of those scenarios at the same time,   
and leaving it to the reader to understand how  
their position may be affected,  
since only they know if they are long, short, call or put,  
and describing that for four positions is another essay. 


I guess it would be helpful to create at least one example.  

I think the wiki page might be at maximum word count, so I may have to link to another page.Haha you got one downvote, Thats seriously nothing. I called someone an gigantic idiot for holding his shares of LK from $25 to delist. It was a few thousand dollars worth lol. The sub downvoted me to oblivion but I still stand with my comment. That guy was a moron

Dont  let the hive mind keep you from learning something new. 

It took me a few weeks to learn the difference so dont worry if you dont understand it the first time. Watch different sources on the subject and it will eventually click for you. 

Also, ask a million questions. That helps a lot tooBack to positive nowIn general, many sentences don’t follow on from the previous very well. 

For example, what bugged me the most was you would define a concept, then expand on the topic, then out of nowhere bring in a very very far off conclusion like “so beware theta decay”. Given that this is geared towards beginners, it would be best to keep it simple. 

Best to keep it in the structure of:
Options have intrinsic and extrinsic value. 

Explain very clearly what intrinsic value is, and where it comes from (OTM, ATM, ITM). Remind people the difference between a call and a put. Relate intrinsic value to calls and puts. 

Then move on to extrinsic value, and explain its sources. As soon as you bring in implied volatility and time value, define and explain those. Again, use calls and puts as examples. If you are going to bring in long/short examples, be sure to touch on every possible scenario (long call, short call, long put, short put)

And once you have explained the necessary concepts, then go into your answer to the original question “why did my option lose money...”..

Hard to pinpoint specific examples, but the best way I can describe how I felt when reading this wiki post is it sounds like someone wrote this on the fly in response to the question, adding bits here and there as soon as you thought of it. It feels quite stream of consciousness, and for reference if I gave an answer like this in my derivatives exam i would expect around 50%, ie. a passable response that ticks most boxes, but cannot be said to have been written clearly, logically, and coherently.Thanks for the explanation. I brought my acc from 1k to 5k in a month (buying calls) and thought I was hot shit, bought DIA puts and lost the new 4k to theta so I thought, where tf does that money go? 

It seems the biggest knock to theta gang is the “opportunity cost” of the collateral... small price to pay for safe gainsPerfect analogy lmao as long as nothing goes terribly wrong, they just collect those monthly paymentsI spend too much time in WSB laughing at it all.That makes sense. Yeah, I think one good example would help put it all in context."I bEliEvE iN lUcKiN" heres my shitty DD blah blah blah.

There was tons of that.  Thats why I dont trade these stupid meme stocks. If you hit a home run with them you think youre a genius, but you actually just got luckySee I did the opposite. I lost a bunch buying puts at the bottom and then gained it back buying calls on the rally up. Then I was like I wanna keep my money now, and was introduced to r/thetagang. Just do put credit spreads to start out tbh that's all I do. Stonks only go up so you're just betting that the price won't go below your put spread. Of course, plenty of research first.Selling a put is LITERALLY underwriting insurance for someone looking to protect their position.WSB use to be the shit. Then it got famousThis is really brief, but does it provide enough to help, in the context of that essay?

###What extrinsic value does to option value  

If you have an open option position, say expiring in a month,  
assuming no price movement of the underlying stock:   
extrinsic value increases cause near-term gains for long options, and near-term losses for shorts;     
extrinsic value decreases cause near-term losses for long option, and near-term gains for shorts.I feel like theta gang benefits heavily from stagnant stocks, it doesn’t even really have to go your way but just not go too far the opposite direction before a preset time. Only my second month trading options but it seems you can safely (80%+ chance) get around 3% returns on your collateral per week. With 10k you can pretty much make full time minimum wage job money just selling covered putsI am working on a tool to help visualize option prices, haven’t incorporated a way to show implied volatility yet, but you can see them impact on time clearly. Here you can see prices for calls and puts on SPY: https://priceprobability.com/plots/spy

BTW, works best on a desktop. To make visible and hide each line just click on it in the legend.(each line is a strike price) If you double click a line everything becomes hidden except that line. Let me know what you think please.Ok I’ve always thought of it like the only reason you would get the stock in the first place (to protect) is because you’re about to make your bet but I guess ppl who regularly own more than 100 shares of a company would use them as insurance.It does provide an anchor for the rest of it. 

There's a time later when talking about harvesting theta decay when you mention extrinsic value increasing - is this the anti-decay you're talking about there, or is there a normal decay scenario that will increase extrinsic value? I think that was the one that threw me for a loop.I've been making bank off TSLA. IV/premiums so high I been getting 50% of my spreads usually and close them within a week or two for 30-45DTE contracts. There are so many different strategies though. Like Iron Condors benefit the most I think from stagnant stocks you're mentioning. And check out the wheel strategy, sell csps until assigned then sell ccs until called away and repeat.>With 10k you can pretty much make full time minimum wage job money just selling covered puts

Covered puts or "cash covered/cash secured" puts?Hold up I'ma get on my laptop, sounds interesting. It is hard to use with my pixel, keeps zooming in when I touch. I'm sure you already know though.There are two ways that can occur -- 

Suddenly the market thinks an event may happen, or has happened (surprising economic event, for example), and that increases extrinsic value, and IV,     
or, in situations such as  before an earnings event,   
increasing extrinsic value makes theta decay unharvestable for short options -- which I ~~should be~~ edited to be clearer about -- (and also keeps a long option from losing value, in the run-up to earnings).I’m talking about the type where you have to set the money aside, the amount of the strike price times 100, that you can’t use until the contract is executed or expires. These are the “cash secured” type right? 

I’d love to know what the difference isT- is a little better since it defaults with less strike prices but much more friendly on a full screen. I am tying to get into covered calls and trying to think of a good was to visualize them. The prices are great but when you can’t compare to current price it looses some of its capabilities it feels like.Gotcha, that helps. Thanks!If cash backs something, it's best to say "cash secured".

If stock backs something, it's best to say "covered".

The most technically correct way to "cover" a put is to short 100 shares of the underlying before or while buying the put.OK, so you're talking about a cash covered put. Also referred to as a cash secured put as to not confuse it with a "covered put".

A covered put is when you short a stock, then sell a put against it. So if the contract is initiated, you have the shares to issue already. 

Basically it's covered with shares instead of being covered by holding the money, which is what a cash secured play would have you do.Theynare the same, just different names fir it.Thanks, I understand that shorting a stock is borrowing it and selling it at market price, hoping to rebuy it and return the borrowed stock when the price drops.
If you short the stock (sell borrowed stock at market price) how can you still have the shares to cover the put you sold? Sorry if it's a noob question, just trying to piece it together."You'll want to throw a brick at number 5"> "I made 30% this month. Is this sustainable?"

This one is the best especially given recent market conditions since April. Yes, high-IV bull markets are great for selling puts. No, this is not normal.

I cracked up laughing at one post last week from a guy who said he'd been making 8% per month "since June".Join my discord I swear we are dripping in money.

No, I'm not exaggerating.Because JP Morgan sucks. THATS WHY!!As someone who's trying to learn options, what exactly is the relation between the contract price and stock price?

Is there a relation at all?#6 is fine but hearing this just after losing a ton of money is really difficult to digest, in the moment...> Play ER, never again...

Why not?  Are you ignoring the ongoing pandemic and the fact that the market as a whole took a giant digger yesterday?

Why do people think things in a vacuum, ignoring all the other factors?If options are long dated enough, it’s not as badI play earnings, but usually quick in and out short positions.  I got burned with TSLA two weeks ago with a short strangle though... and of course this week that would have made me some doughFrom what I could tell, mostly it stems from missed azure projections... 47% actual vs 55% expected. 

Maybe? Like I was expecting a fall. But not that big of a fall. 

Then tech tumbled together. 

Here's to hoping it comes back next week to like the 205-208 range[deleted]Also the, buy high sell low tradersWe could also call this person Mr. iamverysmart.::beenfurloughedfor3months::There's two components. Intrinsic value and extrinsic value.

Put simply, intrinsic value is what it is worth if you exercise the contract. Strike is $100, market price $110. So the "intrinsic value" is $10.

However, in the simplest terms, based on the track record of the stock and the time left to expiration, people usually pay more than the intrinsic value for an option.

So for example $COF is at $65.06. A $70 call is worth nothing intrinsically (why would I buy shares at $70 when the market price is $65?) But the $70 calls expiring September 18th are trading for about $2.50. Why, if it's worthless?

Because based on various metrics (such as implied volatility, "the Greeks," chart analysis, etc.), bullish people think the stock will be above $70 between now and September. But rather than buy 100 shares and lock up $6,500, they can spend like $250 on a contract that gives them the right to buy the shares at $70 in the future, sorta like a weird combination of a restaurant reservation and a preorder.

Put simply, the "optionality" is worth something.

"The price of an option is ALWAYS the sum of its intrinsic value and its extrinsic value." - Sheldon Natenberg.6 is fine, but why are you screaming?Without knowing the details of their trade, I assume they got IV crushed.Bc many variables hard, black and white picture easyIt did not :/Finally! Someone who says, "Put simply" and actually explains it that way. Kudos, my good man.I don’t know why, on my phone and have no idea what I’m doing...  XDCan confirm MSFT has taken a massive shit for the past couple weeks now, expected to pick up after earnings but didnt happen.

In hindsight it was just overpriced and got corrected, but in the moment it seemed like total bullshit/MM manipulationYou can achieve the same P+L with a call vertical debit spread (and no stock).  It will cost a fraction of the amount to do that way.This can also be viewed as pairing a long with a synthetic short.What are the Greeks like on a collar position?BUY +1 COVERED MU 100 18 SEP 20 52.5 CALL/MU u/47.77 LMT \[TO OPEN/TO OPEN\]This is not finance advice, but my YouTube channel is 😎 Like and subscribe.You’re probably right and I’m no expert. I usually open the collar with 30DTE and I’ve found that I’ve been able to close the reopen the short call multiple times and collect more premium during that time. It might be just because of the choppy movement during these times and I’ve been lucky. That’s why I said I didn’t find collars appealing before, but they seem to work well for me recently.It's risky to try to time the market with the short call but you can do that with the vertical spread too.yawnGood ol max 100% plays. Yea!Not a trading journal.  
 If posting completed trades or active positions:

When did you take the positions?   
Why?   
Why TSLA?  
Did you pay to close or take to expiration?  Why?I started buying shares of TSLA in 2012, because I saw how successful Elon was with paypal. What I'm trying to say is I've followed the stock for a long time. Think I have a decent feel for it, although it is still wildly unpredictable at times.

I'm in a discord with some guys who were chasing TSLA all day buying calls and puts, but kept getting stopped out. So I thought about the inverse.

Looking for an EOD play, I decided selling OTM TSLA calls could be a way to collect premium considering how Theta would be aggressively gnawing at them.

First sold a TSLA 7/24 1485c first time TSLA came up to 1450, with the hypothesis that TSLA wasn't going to break the high of the day, nor shoot up to 1485.

When I saw the double top forming around 2:30 I sold a TSLA 1475c thinking bulls wouldn't be able to push it up any further. And it did stay in a downwards trend for the rest of the day. 

Next I sold a 1470c as the stock surged around 3:15 and actually collected larger premium. 

I also tack SPY closely and could see that wasn't shooting up so I sold a 1450c pretty late in the trading session because I didn't think it was likely to regain 1450 before closing considering how SPY was moving.

I managed them closely as was ready to buy back the contracts if TSLA started to shoot up, which it is known to do. 

I just set the calls to fill at market and they would take quite awhile to fill. Like over a minute, which has never happened to me with Schwab; market orders usually fill right away. 

I decided to ride them out the whole way to expiration to collect the full premium. Schwab always pays either night of or next day with expired contracts.

I understand that there is theoretically infinite amount of risk, but thought the chances the calls expiring OTM and collecting the premium outweighed the risk; so I sold the calls.Thank you. Post released.care to share the discord?Thank you. Hope someone can learn something. Thanks for being a good mod and making me do my homework.If your long call is further out you can sell closer calls and collect theta. Poor mans covered call
So buy 1 year out. Start selling 30 days.It could, yes. I was going to do a write up of how gamma squeeze occurs. I've researched it quite a bit and it needs certain conditions to be met. I do think what happened today was part of a gamma squeeze as a result of the stock rising bigly this AM at the open. I will break it down in some points below.

1. Last 2 weeks AMD has been having very LARGE call buying in strikes all over the board (back when the stock was about $54). Heavy volume of call buying in all strikes: $57.50/$60/$62.50/etc.
2. MM's hedge according to how big the position is and how far OTM it is. Basically hedging just enough to cover the probability of the stock rising. Typically they hedge with buying shares.
3. As stock price increases and the large volume of calls become closer to being in-the-money, the MMs need to continue hedging with the upward momentum. They can either: buy more shares to remain delta neutral, or bring shares to the market (selling shares) to push the price back down.
4. There are various conditions where they buy shares vs selling shares, and that depends on the borrow rate, share float, etc. 
5. Long-story short it creates an infinite loop of chasing the stock upwards from MM who continuously try and hedge by purchasing stock.

In AMD's case, there was a pre-trigger of the stock already having a good run-up after posting high volumes of call buying last week and week before. MMs were already chasing stock to remain neutral. Today's news had AMD breakout 10% at the open, you had news algos purchasing stock, FOMOers purchasing stock, MM's hedging the calls by purchasing stock. As the big call volume from 2 weeks ago became more and more in the money the cycle repeats over and over.You can exercise the $20 call and turn it into 100 sharesAre you able to kind of spell it out for me. I think I'm just dumb at this point. If I exercise the$20 call let's say at the $25 mark. Won't i be losing all the profit to offer the 100 shares for the $25 call?Well you’d be buying the shares for 2K (1 contract) and selling them for $2.5k. If the stock goes to $27, the owner of the $25 call will be buying shares at $25 that are now valued at $27. If they are below $25, the $25 call won’t be exercised. If the $25 call is exercised, your profit will be $500 minus whatever premium you paid to put the trade on.

Edit: spellingAhhhhh! Thank you so much!99% of brokers will display dte including weekends.Yes. Because a lot can change over a weekend (risk that needs to be priced in), similar to the time between two trading sessions. DTE doesn’t mean just trading sessions. But I believe it’s still up to you or the broker how one wants to look at it.NoOkAre you sure?It does include weekendsDepends; are you aiming for short term calls? Debt doesn’t tend to hold any weight on value until it’s addressed.I'm not saying don't do it, but be careful. Maybe extend the window a bit past the earnings call to lower your risk. It already went up $90 -> $120 (33% increase!) in the last 60 days. The higher volume you heard about might already be priced in.[deleted]Don’t do itYeah I'm probably gonna end up doing an 8/21 exp. That's what I'm wondering, would they address it in their earnings? because its a big number.I’m certain this post is fine.Thanks!Most likely in some brief way. I’m not home right now I’ll check later and get back to you.Thank you and drive safe!As far as I can tell the premium you’re collecting on the call side is nominal.. is that 25 cents using closing mid price? This is a high delta put spread with an FD call spread (risking 500 to the upside for 25 dollars). If stock goes up a bit you should get a vol contraction but I’d ditch the call spread completely if you’re that confident in direction. If you’re closing at 50%, the best that call spread can do is contract 12 cents which isn’t helping that much. 

Don’t listen to me I’m an idiot but those are my thoughts. I don’t see a condor here given your thesis.I think it good, I just don't know how volatile, you  don't want to do to early.

&#x200B;

I myself got 4 contracts for NAK for 8/21 but I am scared its too early, and should have maybe done a longer callI second this - well said. But I am also an idiot.Sounds like you want to hit a home run, and don’t want to limit profits to only the premium of options soldShort answer: If you have an external requirement -- like hold time for taxes -- don't do the Wheel on it. Find something else to trade, or learn to be patient.

Long answer: You control the risk of your shares getting called away. As long as you don't get greedy and keep on top of your trades, the risk is low. The risk is not zero, but so what? If your shares get called away, you get a pile of money that would enable you to buy more shares. So really the only thing at risk is the tax hold. That being the case, *calculate the actual value of the tax advantaged treatment* and compare to your estimate of profit/loss if you relax that hold time requirement. If the profit potential of writing CCs is enormous relative to the tax hold value, don't be penny wise and pound foolish.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/options) if you have any questions or concerns.*I suggest delving into the topic of trading psychology. Each person brings their own history. 

Mark Douglas wrote a couple of books, Trading in the Zone, The Disciplined Trader. There are YouTube videos and summaries.

I like Douglas' analogy of first exposure to dogs. If the first few dogs a person meets are angry, there is a good chance that person will have a deep seated fear.

Take this to money and trading. First allowance, first spending decisions, first piggy bank or savings, first few trades can have a big psychological impact.

Trading psychology can be a deep topic. Well worth the time for the vast majority. The few that don't need it, are naturals.sell puts until you get assigned another 100 

then sell calls against 100/200 shares 

best of both worldsEvolutionary psychology.

Acquisition and possibilities = large dopamine reward.

Holding = security; large serotonin reward.

Selling and no longer holding = loss of possibilities and security. Does not feel good. It’s not supposed to.

But some manage themselves well and make a killing in the process.If your shares are called away,  immediately sell another put. Wash rule applies.sure, so in my definition, a homer would be a +10% trade.

But are there any other benefits to buying as opposed to selling?

I can't seem to shake the feeling that there is an intrinsic psychological benefit to having already "let go" of the initial cost of premium, whereas when selling I feel like I still have the premium and that if the trade goes the opposite way, it's immensely more difficult to follow my strategies. At what point does an intrinsic psychological benefit begin to represent extrinsic gainsThats a good way of explaining itWash rule only applies to loss. Gains are always taxed.Buying is more fun because If youre right you can see some nice gains. Selling is a lot easier and more consistent because you don’t have to be right, You just can’t be wrong. It’s a lot easier to not be wrong than it is to be rightAdam Warner's book, chapter 4 I believe?, Talks about the volatility during the year, it's a good read if you've got time.Usually yes because higher premiums with more DTEI sell weeklies against longs with 2-18 months left.

Theta decay is real and accelerates as you get to expiry. That last week is brutal.>with more DTE

The biggest benefit really. But, if you have speculation about a stock, wouldn't it be beneficial to wait a few more weeks/months when the premiums reduce a bit? Unless you are paying the extra as insurance the stock changes earlier than expected.I'm talking about the sell sideMy post was about buying! But good insight none the lessI mean more time means you have more time for the stock to move in your direction, and that's why it costs moreYou’re in the money right now eh? Just close itBuy. To. Close. NOW. The entire spread, all in one order.It seems like nobody here understands what a credit spread is. Your max possible loss was $400 since the width of the spread is $5 (multiply that by 100) and the credit is $100 and you can't lose that. Your account might show -$299,500 for a few days, but you aren't actually going to lose that much money since the lower put will exercise, giving you a profit of $299,000. This leaves you with the $500 loss (minus the credit you collected). I'm not sure if all brokerages automatically exercise spreads, so I won't comment on this, but it they don't, it would be extremely reckless of them.

I lost on a credit spread on SPY, so I had -$30,000 or so in my account for a few days, but I knew it wasn't accurate since I also saw that both legs of my spread exercised. There was another trader who committed suicide because they saw negative $730,000 in their account but didn't understand that their actual loss was much less. Please educate yourself on options before you start trading them.

Edit: I just noticed that you were wondering about what happens if the put you bought is out of the money. In that case, I believe you just sell the 100 shares at market price, so you lose the difference between that and the put you sold. If the price were less than $1 under the put you sold (so $2,994), you'll still come out of this with a profit. The put you bought is only there to cap max loss.Yes, yes you are at risk! Close your position or roll.Dont hold to expirationPlay stupid games win stupid prizes even though amz is not a bad prize if you've got the cash for itmommy  😥Thanks. So the long put does not actually expire worthless? It’s exercised? Ive just started learning about options a week ago and just in the last few days stared learning about credit spreads.thank younah, that's the whole reason I'm doing credit spreads... i want to generate some steady income, albeit low profit but at least something steady.

buying calls and puts is just too much gamblingIn general, don't hold spreads you can't afford to cover to expiration. Dump them before. Even if it's max loss. Better max loss than 300k from an assigned short and worthless long.If it's ITM it is exercised. If OTM it is not. If it's OTM the shares should be sold at a market price above the put price.and putting money into schemes about which you know very little is not?How does that even work though, doesn’t the broker force exercising the bought put to cover anyways? How can someone possibly be assigned several hundred thousand dollars in shares without the collateral?ok sold both my spreads, and actually between the two made $100 profit.
So in case both Puts expired in the money how are the exercised? do I lose my collateral and get some shares in return? I'm confused how would this work any different than a cash covered put... this is simply a cash covered and hedged put? right? please? tell? me?Can you dump a put that you sold? How does that work? Just FYI I have never done a credit spread.Is it possible to close a put you sold before expiration? People are telling OP to close both positions but how do you close a put you sold?> How does that even work though, doesn’t the broker force exercising the bought put to cover anyways?

Before or after expiration?

Before:  Not if you don't have enough buying power to cover the exercise. A risk management team on the ball would close (buy to close) the whole spread before that could happen, though. They don't trust us to have the smarts to do that ourselves. Not all of them are on the ball though (I'm looking at you, Robinhood).

After: If the long is ITM, yes. If it is OTM, I'm not sure what brokers would do. They are not obligated to do the exercise for you.

But it's not a good idea to trust a broker to do anything automatically. They could have all kinds of reasons why they don't do what you expect them to do. Don't leave it to chance, take your own action and control your own money.> So in case both Puts expired in the money how are the exercised? 

In the perfect situation, you get assigned on the short put and your broker automatically exercises the long put. 

You have to deliver shares to the long put and will receive the strike price x 100 in cash. You may be temporarily short shares until the assigned short put settles, but you'll have ~300k in cash.

Then the short put assignment happens, and you have to deliver cash to the assignment and will receive long shares. The cash required will be less than the cash you collected from the long, by exactly the spread width, so you keep the difference. The long shares you receive cover the short shares.

So by Tuesday of the following week, you'd have the max profit of the spread in your account and no shares.

But that's the ideal situation, when everything works perfectly. It doesn't always work out that way. If both legs are deep enough ITM on expiration day to have low risk of getting split, call in an exercise order to your broker, at least 1 hour before the cutoff time (which ranges from 4 to 5:30pm EST, depending on your broker). Don't leave the automatic exercise of the long to chance. Keep in mind that there are long hold times on broker phones these days, so 1 hour ahead might not be enough.If both puts expired ITM they would both (*probably*) exercise and the long stock and short stock would cancel out. You would be left with no position at all.Use optionsprofitcalculator.com to calculate your max profit and loss in the future. You can also use Analyze trade in thinkorswim or on tastytrade to see your profit/loss chart. Robinhood doesn't have these features. I'm new to spreads too and learning.Yes, it's called legging out. You buy-to-close the short leg and can let the long leg ride.Yeah, but by close, they mean buy back the put they sold and sell the one they bought. You can exercise it early, but that's essentially never a good idea since you lose any extrinsic value the option has.Yeah I mean I’d always close out myself. But literally what would his account look like? 100 shares of amazon and negative however many hundreds of thousands of dollars in buying power?thank you for explanation makes sense!thank youShort 100 shares, since you deliver shares to a long put. And get ~300k in return.YesThat’s goddam terrifying.Thanks for the correction = )I’ve always been a bit skeptical because you could easily be missing a part of the picture.  For instance, a whale with a large tech portfolio might be buying a pile of protective puts.  He’s not bearish.

Or someone trading multi-leg options where you have to guess what the other leg(s) are.I've made around 20k using market chameleon just for plays that screamed insider trading. I only place calls on options that have 95 to 100% call to put ratio and IV under 30%. Just look for stocks that don't make any sense for raised relative volume - no earnings coming up, events, etc. My biggest wins have been on MARK, IDEX, and SRNE. Buying shares is also a good idea for lower risk playsI tried cheddar flow for a week. Net negative. But it is a good tool to see where the market is moving and if you want to day trade momentum. It is most useful to get some ideas but doing your own DD is the most critical. I failed at this. Blindly following wont yield anything.noGet a free TD Ameritrade account and then in the trade tab you can view quantity of options sold for a certain stock. You can also view spreads being bought and sold for it as wellCan you please put a link with the preset you have. Thanks!RemindMe! 2 weeksThat was my net assumption as well. I tried Benzinga’s free option flow and didn’t see an immediate benefit.

I did see a stock that had a news release minutes after a call sweep that did 50x. I was left thinking that there was no way to perform dd that quickly and understand the driver of the sweep.I ran a backtest on similar data from algoflow with a similar result. It's difficult to distinguish between actual positions and hedges for positionsThanks for all of the feedback. 

Originally, when I began proving my main option-based strategy, I began to believe that I was chasing ghosts when studying option derived attributes such as unusual option flows, skews, largest IV increases, and so on.

For me I couldn’t process this data quickly enough to formulate a logical trade. It was just too much random noise for me but I’m glad others have success with it.

 I like to gamble.Bought three Sep 52.5/55 call credit spreads, $0.78 each (big spender). Hope things pick up since the Aug 58 puts I sold before earnings are not looking good...I bought Feb 2021 55C. A little bit too early. Let hope it rebound.I bought the $52 strike FD expiring next Friday for $70 10 minutes before the market close.Dead cat bounce, market over reaction.

$50pps matches march low.

Last time i checked, intc was a blue chip and not some robinhood penny stock.

-16% drop is a bit much.

Obviously its a gamble, as most options plays are.My strategy as well. Options largely lost 90-95% value on the 8/7 $52c

That’s insane for a blue chip.
This isnt hertz and they didn’t declare bk.

Would be surprised if there isnt a bounce.

The massive discount on premiums alone is worth the gamble.

Best of luck

Edit: also have ex-div on 8/6I did something similar, I bought the 9/18 $55c for a buck even early in the trading day. Good luck to us!!Nice, i wish i picked up some longer calls but i spazzed out when i saw the dip and just bought.

GLJanuary 2021? I don't know if you gave yourself enough time... 

;)Yeah.

Im banking on a a dead cat bounce and value seekers to make a small pop.

The next support level down from this is in the $44 range and if we trend that way, itll suck bit i might roll all of my calls over by a monthI feel like 16% is a little much as well.  Earnings were solid.Robinhood users loaded up on INTC today. You have lots of company thinking the same thing. I don’t think it’s a bad idea.Agreed. Hoping to get a quick pop up and cash out. If things stabilize, i'll buy stock, write a call, and capture dividend. We'll see.A 5% bounce back from these levels will put a $52c itm

This isnt some scammy penny stock and yes, they crushed earnings.

I bought a bunch of 8/7 calls at a $1.30 avg

Going to hold through next week and slowly sell if in the greenIf a bunch of them are willing to buy hertz, gnc, and Chesapeake after they declare bk...surely theyll have some sense in taking a spin with a blue chip that took a 16% haircut after beating earnings?What you have discovered is that all the kids that were trying to tell you that "Stonks only go up" were lying to you.Well I bought 4 September $220 calls Thursday.  Today at 3:45 I bought 2 more $220s for October.  My money says it’ll test the all time high again in the next 2-3 weeks, I plan on exiting most if not all of my calls if it makes it to $215 or so. 

They just killed earnings (as expected), analysts almost unanimously give a buy rating with price targets over $215.  It’s a golden opportunity if you ask me.  I generally only sell options, but on occasion when I see what I believe to be a great opportunity I’ll go long. I believe this to be one of those opportunities. 

So for what it’s worth, I’m right there with you, and I’m holding. 

Also, I wouldn’t suggest ever putting more than around 10-15% of your portfolio on any one play.  The way you win at this game is by avoiding big hits.  Small consistent wins will make you a winner.  Swinging for the fences will break you.Settle down. Weekend is here so you'll just need to wait for Monday pre market to get an idea of you should cut & run or hold for a couple of days. Nonetheless, you're gonna hear a lot about learning the Greeks (very helpful to understand delta and theta) and IV. 

Chances are you'll need a hope & prayer for your calls to get in the money. But holding for the hope until expiration is self-sabotage. 

Not telling you what to do but what I would do is sell on Monday or Tuesday when it looks like there's some recovery. Maybe even Wednesday. But Thursday is AAPL earnings which - FD there's bad news or a poor reaction - hmm further your plight. Even good news might still affect your position.

Good luckwhatever happens, regardless of your perspective, losing 1400 ain't shit. even if this goes as bad as possible you'll be backUnfortunately we all have our “size kills” moves. The only way to remain in the game long term is to keep positions small. It spreads the risk out among underlyings. 

If you think you will be unable to remove all emotion from this position, I would just realize the loss and move on. If you can really dig in and remain mechanical, you might recover it. 

Did you have a plan for this scenario when you opened the trade? If not, close that shit and move on.I have some 8/21 $210 calls.

Here is the "hope"...  Any two of these should help bring MSFT back up:

* Next stimulus package is passed and it's somewhat kind to consumers.

* More vaccine progress.

* FB/GOOG/AMZN earnings next week are amazing.  This is what makes me a bit nervous.  Anything but stellar earnings will drive big tech down and take MSFT with it.

* US-China trade tensions ease

* Fed meetings on Wednesday announce positive news$1500?   Baby street bet man.  Just wait and look back at this years from now, you’ll laugh when you’ve got 100k on the line...that will be the time to sweat.You have a long time to expiry...a standard call option is guaranteed, by law, to have the value of the gain built into the option price if it is in the money...you cannot lose money of MSFT is over 207.5 by 8/31...

Now, you bought alot of extrinsic value because the longer term, but as that extrinsic value decays, the intrisic will go up if MSFT gets back to your strike price.

You just need to decide if you still trust MSFT to get back to 207.5 by then.../shrugJust hold, you’ll be fine.  I’m in 7/28 @ $205 and 8/21 @ $220.  These will print, I’m confident.Dollar cost average I assume.  Just hold tight, tech in general might recover a bit next week into earnings then sell off again . If it does, you might be able to exit or at least limit some losses and hold a few calls. You got time, don’t panic sell. Options swing big up n down, especially this past month so hold on. Unless you see another two days in the red on msft I think you’ll be fine 👍Hold on to it.  It will come back upYou have time, you’ll be good.I'm new to options as well, but I would take the risk and hold instead of taking a guaranteed loss now.All tech stocks getting clapped rn, wait for Monday it should rebound, lost 800 on nvidia calls RIPThat is what people say about Tesla, Apple or even Nikola stocks with H2 costs 6X more than gas to run. They will never go down. What makes you believe that what goes up will not come down in this business environment?  Everywhere there are more young people also getting infected. Arrested military spies from another country. Many more are still at large.

You may be able to reduce your loss but enough damage has been done. Suggest you put a time line when you need to close to reduce you bad bets.  That takes a lot of discipline and skills in options. It is never meant for beginners.Good news is you bought some time. You have five weeks for it to recover.

I always ask what I think the stock will do going forward to make my judgements. If you think msft will go up before expiry then hold. If you think it's going down then sell.A lot can change in a month so see how this week goes8/28 is million year away for options Hold and DCA, it’ll recover.Yeah I went all in on MSFT because it’s been consistently going up for the past months and I felt like it was a safe blue chip to buy calls for. But at the same time the mistake I made wasn’t buying MSFT calls, it was going all in.My plan was that I felt that when MSFT went down 2% after earnings that it was an over reaction since while earnings weren’t perfect they were still better than expected, so I was planning to hold for a couple days for the price to recover as people realized that the sell off that occurred after earnings was an over reaction. But then the entire tech sector decided to tank that day... lol now I honestly don’t have a plan other than hoping it goes back up next week, if it isn’t fully recovered by next week I’m just sell at a loss and move on.the vaccine might not help tech. Big reason why tech has been doing badly for last 2-3 weeks is due to sector rotation. Money that got pumped into tech cause tech was basically the best sector for corona investing, got taken out and put into biotech and and travel.Also, for what it is worth, MSFT is one of the most stable stocks over the last 20 years...I would not panic sellAlright I will thank youWhat does DCA mean?Dont YOLO money you can't lose without doing DD and actually thinking about itI lost on MSFT this year. Safe? Hardly.I, myself, am still holding multiple 8/14 bull credit spreads on MSFT in the 205 range...I am not worried in the leastYou can also sell calls against it to recoup some of your cash now.  Just remember if your short call is going to be ITM you’ll want to exercise your long call early to cover it.Buy more to average down your cost if you’re still bullish.It expires 8/28.  Give it another week.  I had Walmart options that lost 90% in value the first 2 weeks then it gained enough for me to make a couple hundred bucks on it.  I’d rather lose the money than sell at a huge loss.  Yeah,  it’s a bigger loss letting it expire OTM but a few more hundred bucks isn’t going to change my life.  I’d rather let it ride.Don’t you need to own 100 shares to sell calls thoughI can’t I went all in :(Alright thanks I’ll wait til the end of next week then decide to sell or not. Your Walmart story gave me hope :DIt’s a synthetic stock position.  You control the shares because you own the call.  You can sell calls against your callYou still have >a month. Theta is still low.I would be careful not to let them expire if you don’t have the cash to back up an assignment. You can always close them mid day. At that point theta should have ate the price down drastically anyway and you can buy it back for profit. I like the IC approach tho. Stay around the 30 delta and put on several trades. You can make some money that way.if your sold put or call expires in the money, and the other legs out the money you run risk of assignment and you'll be screwed...Luckily everything expired worthless . Let’s say it did get assigned the loss is capped at the spread amount tho right? The other legs should offset or mitigate the loss ? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ma1mXXFLGA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ma1mXXFLGA)Any else think it's hot garbage that you have to wait until Monday to settle an options position?Interesting thanksGreat posts!  I personally love vertical spreads for hedged directional plays so nice to see real life examples of risk and rewardI have 50 buy contracts @ 7 that expire on 8/21 myself.  I’m just hoping they spike enough after ER to dump.  


I’d tell your dad to not go full retard on a junk stock.   I realize the options are cheap but 2,000 contracts at that strike add up to huge money.   Why not just get 500?If it's a stock without a lot of liquidity you can get screwed. There has to be buyers in order to sell it. I wouldn't buy such huge positions on a cheap stock if no nes trading it. When I first started out I made that mistake...had a winning position in theory but no one was buying so I lost.That’s what I keep telling him. Who would even buy all those contracts a week before expiration? Even if it’s far ITM i don’t think people will actually buyYes that’s my biggest worry! That no one would buy! Any recommendations on how I can see the liquidity? I use RHI don't know Robinhood. But in my option chain in fidelity you can see open interest and how many people are buying contracts at each strike.So higher the open the interest the better? That means how many contacts are people willing to buy? Mine says 20,000 for my expiration### Things to Remember

^^^^2020-07-24On the other hand, I’m crying over my Intel losses 😭Same here... It's going to be a tough weekend to sleep over it.this is how investing works... don't stress about short term losses.AMD and CHGG are making me proud.Its pretty bloody. But I take solace when its the overall market and not one or 2 stocks I own. Also this seems to be a very healthy correction  from some ATHs. I bought more today. Should pay nicely over the next couple weeksIts not a loss until you sell at a loss. (I hope) it will all correctI'm safe for now, I own amdWorth itSpeak for yourself! I'm up 0.27% !This week sucked fuckDoesn’t seem that bad, I’m up 11% this week.You're not alone, friend.Can’t think of a better, more accurate description tbh.Laughs in profitable Amazon spreadsDown 800 
"Sad noises"My first ever week money. I’m shook. This is gonna change how I trade/invest going forward.Shares at least have infinite amounts of time to reverse

My portfolio is all options right now and they’re aaaaaallll red.TSLA gang rise ~~up~~ downi transfered assets out recently so they closed my account even though I told them I still planned to use them....they were like great you can apply again with a  new email so my old account is just gone forever....okay bye time to go to a different brokerage that's wont do shit like that.Im up 3% this week. Today was a bad day thoAnyone else get in Draft Kings last week or week before?Its the possible second shut down we are facing because of coronavirusTbh I felt this but I also bought a lot of those dips lmao so I'm stokedcall options with Aphria expiring in Jan 2021. needless to say it's going well.I’m up 15% this year!I’m up 29% this week in RH. Paid the dip tax in another platform. Up 29% just because of one stock. Care to guess?It’s just on sale...Yeah, I've just decided to stick with apple and Amazon from now onThat's why I use SoFiShould invest in Aphria [APHA] 

Been making money ever since the JuneThe market hasn’t been too bad this week‘Scuse me just hopping in the boat 😔😔😫Saaaaaame.Tell that to mr. margin call.Secured my AMD and TSM profits after holding since $52 on AMD today. Hoping for a correction Monday.Same. 25% on amd this week ain’t shabbyGood thing I sold all my amd at 56This guy ~~fucks~~ found inner peaceBloody is when you lose 80% on a fomo buy.  LolIf you hold like a boomer you'll be fine, if your picks are strong companies. Short term, it's a shit showYep, I'm buying the dip and hoping it will.I'm up 1.05% so I was kinda surprised to even know that the market was down this week.  I have beaten the market since the March drop though, so it's been smooth sailing for me.Nice!What’s the secret?Nice!  That's really impressiveNice job!  That beats my 13.8%I was gonna guess AMD, but it's only up 26%... I can't really think of any other trending stocks up big this week.  Did you buy calls on AMD or TSM?True, but I own some so if it's on sale I lose money.  I am buying the dip thoughAmzn a little pricy imo. When did you buy?Yeah like a dollarya 7% gains can't complainTech hasn't done well.I don’t think I’d like speaking with Mr. Margin Call very muchI did the same after holding from 10 bucks. Did it this morning but should have waited, hindsight 20/20. Correction hopefully happens next few daysI hope no correction. Amd earnings is next week.I think they are, my top holdings are MSFT, GOOGL, TSLA, TXN, and NVDA.Honestly I just keep buying to stay up. Probably stupid buttt stonksMixing in a bit of the right crypto along with traditional stocks. Most of my crypto isn’t in RH, but I like seeing the mix there.

Gotta love the negative votes for an honest answer.Anything better than High Yield savings works for me 😁 I think it requires diversifying and investing in some anchor investments and not too many unknowns. Some unknowns are good but make sure not the whole portfolio. I’m up to 14 different companies.Just AMD. I exercised the 52.5 C options last week. Sold half today. Half next week before earnings.You can buy fractions of a share. And back in may I bought my first shareprofit is profitDang that’s impressive. I’m up .5%, and can definitely live with that.One of the hardest lessons for people to learn in this business is that profits are profits. A 1% gain because you were timid is better than a 5% loss because you waited too long. Never dwell on what could have been when it comes to investing.I bought a lot of stocks really close to the bottom in March, which is my only claim to fame. A lot of growth came out of oil stocks, where I currently have about 200%+ on all of them since March. I got my money back around May and reinvested them into some other stocks that were still recovering, and since then I have been generally coasting along, with only a little put into a monthly dividend stock. I have been lucky this far,but anticipate my fall soon.Yeah but 71¢ in a month isn't that good, you could make more money taking a nickle out of the city fountain for a monthPast few mornings thought I was going to the moon but each day it trickled back down. Today was the opposite 🤷‍♂️Amen! I made options calls on  NIO and SPCE this week and made a killing. Could have made more, but I got burned with NAT on calls real bad one time and I said never again. It hasn't happened since.um I'm up 28.57% in less than a month, ima do me. good luck though!Lol cool, Bud 👌👍You should add a column that indicates if the dividend has been suspended.O, STAG and MAIN are probably the only ones worth investing in but they are probably going to go red for a long time due to covid. Not right now but soonishI honestly wouldn't share that. That's misleading to a LOT of potentially newer non-stock educated investors on RH. [Dividend.com](https://Dividend.com) screener can show you the % yield for pretty much everything. This is a good way to lead people to lose money, and a lot of it. It's no different than all these short sellers touting $HTZ to RH users. This is the stuff that gives this user base a bad name. I would highly suggest deleting this.Unless you are over 70+ ignore high yield dividends and focus on growth companiesThis looks...awesome?  40% return on CPTA? ????Just at a glance, it looks like CRF is just priced to go down 10% / year and pays 10% div yield... go figure

GNL pays a high return but is 100% commercial REIT which such a nightmare with COVID advancing work-from-home cultureHigh dividends is a great way to get dividends and lose more on the underlying stock LOL. I just looked at the first tickers 10 year chart and it was terrible. There is always a reason why company’s offer high dividends and it’s because the stock typically doesn’t perform well.With the exception of only a few, those are terrible stock picks. This is a good way to lose money.

Stop chasing yield! You WILL lose money investing like this.AwesomeNice! I hold a bunch in MAIN for this reason but there looks like some other good options higher on the list.Jnk is also a good one. A nice stable etf.
Sphd hasn’t gotten close to its price before COVID so idk how good it is on the growth side. I like schd for quarterly dividend.Omg thanks man!!!DHT, currently around $5.60, dividend 0.32KIO has been solid with reliable payouts.SLG is also good.I'm totally new but have been able to turn my free $3 stock from joining Robinhood into $70 since last October. 

I noticed one of my stocks has a dividend listed and am just now starting to figure out what they are. 

Is there a site that lists companies that pay dividends? Is it only certain companies that do so based on the way they are listed or is the expectation that all companies will once they reach certain milestones?

Thanks in advance,

An idiot who just looks at graphsThis is great!GECC pays about .08/ stock a month and did decent through the COVID lockdown.Great stuff . Thank you!Save some time and just invest in SPHD for monthly dividends. Pay out is $1.85 a share annually, so .15 cents a share each month.

Edit: didn’t mean to sound dismissive OP, this was very kind of you to shareWhat stocks would I want to invest in for dividends,id like to go for stable stocks as im almost 19 and want to start investing nowHe forgot to check all of them. EPR suspended their dividends.Dividend aristocrats😂😂Amen. I very foolishly put a lot of money into VYM a few years back. When I look at my other holdings like QQQ I feel like it really was not wise.


I actually cashed out of my VYM a few months ago and put it into growth heavy ETFs and am much happier.The actual stock is -75% in the past year though, and -42% in the last 3 months...

*And the dividend is currently suspended lolThey also stopped paying dividends...If they don't lower their dividend.  I checked out historic dividends for some of these companies they are not stable, I personally wouldn't jump on these.Look up the dividend aristocrats and dividend kings lists. These are stocks that have been increasing their dividends every year for 25/50 years, so they’re reliable. Most of the very high dividend yielding stocks will suspend their dividends at some pointXOMVIGSPHD, see my comment aboveCoca cola/pepsiWell, it depends on what you want to do. VYM isn't bad, it's actually a decent growth stock with a decent % yield. If you are looking for a diversification of weekly/monthly dividend payouts for compounding or DRIP VYM is a good holding that gives consistent returns.A great example why chasing the highest dividend yield isn't necessarily a good strategyThank you kind sir. I looked them both up. Now I will dedicate some time to try to understand it. I appreciate the point in the right direction.Didn’t they suspend their dividends tho?What do they charge in terms of fees tho? Since they’re an ETFNo prob. If you’re looking at dividends for a reliable income stream, only invest in solid companies that’ll still be solid in the future. That’s the biggest lesson I’ve learned in my short time of investing. 

A company may be a dividend aristocrat now, but if they have a ton of debt and aren’t innovating, they may not keep their dividends for longNo. At least not yet.  They have a dividend yield of 8% and have increased their dividend for 37 straight years.  That said, they’re expected to lose money in q2 but only about $2 billion which is not a big issue for them.  The dividend may be at risk but not significant risk until they start losing money on a more consistent basis..3% it’s very minimalDuly noted. Thank you. After my "fun money" gets up to $100 I plan on dedicating half to long term investments like you have just discussed and play with the other half on the short term hops like I have done so far.

The goal is to gamble with $50 to $99 and whenever I get to $100 pull out half for long term investment. 

I know that going from $3 to $70 had a lot to do with luck since I don't even understand how it all works. I'm just trying to ensure I have some sort of long term  strategy. I will make sure to dig deep into these companies before making a decision. 

Thanks again,

An appreciative noobHuh, that’s strange. I coulda swore that they suspended it. Must’ve been confusing it with something else. Thanks for the correction'Now all I see is red, red, red' 🚨⛽🔥At least something good came out of this weekBTDDown $26000 on tsla.Was literally just talking to my wife lol...same.SEEING RED AGAIN

The Red - ChevelleThis week was BRUTAL for me.You have money for the dollar menu?Don't kill yourself. I have no clue what you did but you likely aren't going to owe anything like that. Wait til Monday when trade settles.I can't believe Robinhood still hasn't made this more intuitive after what happened.robinhood fucks up spreads at the end of the day. its a visual bug. itll fix itsself first thing monday.I think I found the issue, thank you for supportEverything will shake out by Monday open. I had this happen last Friday, and buying power showed -112k.  My credit spread fell between my short and long strike so I was not able to exercise the long strike, however Robinhood auto closed the short position and the buying power corrected itself.There was a guy who killed himself over this?Give it till Monday you’ll be credited with shares or cash , and then it’ll be sold back you’ll only be out what you put in everything will be okayYou have to upgrade to Gold to turn off the surprise panic attack featureYes, relax and take a deep breath no way you will owe anything close to that amount.The problem is they try and distill a bunch of complicated financial instruments and statements into a big dumb line graph for babies. Half the issues posted here are some variation of "line no match?!" 

There's a reason all the other brokers vomit numbers at you.Congrats on the gainsYes. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/finance-isnt-worth-losing-your-life-over-the-heartbreaking-story-of-a-rookie-trader-who-racked-up-700000-in-debt-2020-06-14This is why I consider banning people who say stupid shit like "still the best UI/app."YesOh RobinHood..just the worst.Up 18 cents? LolIf you are holding options it makes the charts weird. Better off calculating on your ownDamn which country has Robinhood available on browser??AhThat’s 9 tootsie rolls to youYea i know it was fine but then i saw i was down almost 300 and i almost shit myselfUsaThanks. I’m in brazil. Will turn on the VPnHave funIf you buy a Put, you have the right, but not the obligation to sell at the Strike price. If you sell a Put, you could get assigned, and then you’re obligated to buy at the Strike price.So let's say I buy an Uber Put. I then want to sell it cause I made some profit...If I sell it wouldn't that just get rid of it off my account all together? 

&#x200B;

Or do you mean selling a put initially?What you’re talking about is called closing your position. If you bought a call/put and don’t want to take it to expiration, you can sell it. Depending on the stock price in relation to the strike price you can make money, but you can also lose money. If a trades going against you you can sell for a loss instead of it going further against you and thus mitigating your loss

If you buy a call or put, you have the right to purchase shares at the strike price you choose. You have the freedom of whether you want to exercise the option or not, regardless of the stocks price at expiration. The most money you will lose buying a call/put is the money you pay when you first open the contract

Selling a contract is different. You’re selling someone else the same rights you yourself have when buying a call/put. In that case, the person you sold the contract to can choose to exercise, and it’s possible you can get assigned. Most brokers will require you to own the underlying shares or keep a serious amount of capital as collateral in the event you get assigned

Depending on the amount of premium you collect, and the amount of time left before expiration, selling an option that ends up going against you can blow up your account real quick. Even if it doesn’t it can tie up a lot of your capital for the duration of the contract. Some contracts don’t expire until 2022. It’s a long time to have the money tied up

It’s almost never recommended to sell just an individual call or put, but instead sell a call, and then buy one yourself, which is called a spread. This lets you control your amount of risk and knows exactly how much you stand to lose worst case scenario

Free guided lessons with a lot of good info. Good luck!Really REALLY appreciate the detailed response. Thank you. Just wanted to ensure that if I bought a put, I wouldn't be forced to buy 100 shares at expiration.No problem. If you have any other questions feel free to dm me. 90% of what I’ve learned is from optionalphaTreat it like a actual job, devote certain hours to it, check your positions and make your moves. Research, research research. Set limits and stick to them. Don’t get FOMO because you see green. By the time you get shares, you are probably on the downside. 

Stay away from options, like away, don’t enable them, but learn about them and understand how the affect market price. You’ll get there in time. 

Oh, and don’t ever put money in there that you were willing to literally light on fire in the first place. Seriously. That first deposit you need to imagine the cash, going outside and lighting it in fire. If you’re good with that, good luck in the markets.Watch out for tech stock right now if you’re looking to invest short term. Download yahoo finance because they have tons of great articles.If I were you I would treat it like a real job. Set a schedule to check the prices and changes in prices. Assuming you already have a job devote a certain amount of cash for each payment you earn and save it to invest with.
Stay on top of earnings reports/calls.

Stay updated on the news, like certain things being global stuff, national stuff and laws/Hobby's
Like with me I like firearms. And my countries always trying to ban certain types of firearms and a few stocks I own that would hugely affect the price of it.

More less as long as you stay on top and limit yourself, because trust me I went crazy and put a boat load in way to fast but ended up ok. 
Most people lose money most people make money.
There are two types of investors, long term short term
Short being they're tryna make a quick dollar and long meaning usually dividends, which I'll provide a link for below

https://www.thebalance.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-dividends-and-dividend-investing-357453
If I were you I'd diversify, some short term stocks to make money off of and then some longer term stocks that reward your share with dividends.

A good stock for dividends that's secure and is capable of not going out of business is ATNT
They pay like a 50 cent dividend per share.
And it's gonna go up and they're under 32 usually or on that price.

Another tip is find a type of stock you like. 
For me I like tech because it's always gonna be changing and has room for improvement, along with some good companies that are strong.
Microsoft 
Apple
Those types and some others.

Hope this helps
I'm new to, I've only been in the stock market for less than a year and a half.
Best of luck. Any thing else you can always PM me or just make another post I'm sureDon't trust those guys on wallstreetbets. They like to gamble more than beginners shouldHe’s entirely right.  Except I disagree slightly about the options.  If you treat it like a job, then you will learn about options and REALLY learn.  Then you will be able to pick good calls or puts and make good money.  Don’t limit yourself.  If you have the smarts, then make money off of them.  Learn first then act.  Then learn some more.

But go at your own pace and risk for loss.  Good luck and congratulations on taking your future into your own hands.This is why I said? learn about them, learn how they work and how the market reacts to them, and get there in time. But at this stage in the game, like a generic post of Reddit timeframe, to stay the hell away from them... 

There are too many mistakes that can be made. That’s not to say there isn’t fortunes to be made in options, but you need to completely understand them before going there, because along with being made, fortunes are lost as well. 

I treat my investing like a part time job. I spend about 20hrs a week researching and making moves. Thankfully my full time job is sitting at a computer, so it all ties together. But the key is scheduling and taking the time to do it if you’re serious about it. i don’t expect a $X/hr, but I schedule and devote the time.So we agree?Yep! Actually 100%... Sorry for not clarifying.They wont be able to refine their own materials until a projection of 2022. Nonetheless I might have bought some a couple days back.Albemarle $ALB is a better corollary play to massive EV growth over the next 10 years. Solid company with a reasonable valuation and in the dividend aristocrats index. 

Iirc they control like 20% of the worlds lithium (component of lithium ion batteries) production and also have revenue streams from other random materials shit like fire prevention materials and bromine. Lithium is currently in oversupply but demand will outpace supply in the next 5 years and analysts forecast lithium prices to grow with a 20% CAGR over the next 10 years[deleted]This could be huge! Any reason why they wouldn’t be on Finviz?Wow an original tip. Thanks OP! Sounds solid as a mid to long hold to me.This seems like a bad play. 

China prices rare earth extremely competitively. It’s why there’s virtually no other producer in the world. Would you buy it for $1/KG from a China or $50/KG from USA? (Not real figures). 

Only THIS administration has been so hostile against China. If Biden wins this year I can’t imagine it still being like this.I bought quite a bit of fvac warrants at 2.20 sold yesterday at 4.45 made a good little chunk of change.Cramer was pushing this today and interviewed them. OP appears to have posted right after it aired.But if US gets friendly with China on trade then any leaps or long holds might go tits up. 
Trailing stops might be a good play.Also, The U.S  is trying to decrease  It’s reliance On China for defense purposes. A lot of jets and defense systems use rare earth materials for components. So the U.S. Needs the capability to produce its needs In house. The government knows thisYawn posting about if after it bumped up 50%.

Electrification and Geopolitics being a strong bull case for me on this stock.😂Yeah I've seen that pop up in the news recently. Not saying it's not viable but anytime there's a new technology it could take years for for it to become widely accepted. Lithium will be the go to for the next 5-10yearsProbably on TeslaIt does have warrants, just not on RHwell I am a noob so that’s not my intentionIn which way would China benefit from limiting REMs. If they cared so much they would have pulled that card during the trade war but they didn’t. 

This company entirely depends on lobbying the government and getting subsidized. Is that really a bet worth making?Because the polls were lies lmaoShe did get the popular vote tho, the electoral college just didn't agree.True, but the Electoral College is the only voting result that counts, as it should be.

The president is the executive of the federation, the union of 50 States. Those 50 States are his "citizens", and they vote in the Electoral Collage.

Each state individually votes for its President and charges their Electoral Collage electors with the duty to vote in that Collage.

Thus, the sum total count of all the States' voters, i.e. the national popular vote, is completely meaningless in the context of how the President is actually elected.Not sure I agree with "as it should be", why not take the popular vote rather than the electoral college? I can't fathom believing that the personal biases and desires of one person disappears once they represent their entire state, and how any one person could accurately represent that. It renders the vote of your everyday citizen to be worthless since an elector can just vote how they want to.Your orders aren’t being filled. Try bidding on the askNever try to place one before regular trading hours, the price won't be the same at open and it won't get filled. Additionally, if you try to place any orders in the first 30 mins of the day good luck because there's a high volume of people getting their orders in at that time (Robinhood is free but not the fastest at sending orders)What if I’m doing say 2 contracts at $40, but the ask price is more than that, is there a reason that it still gets canceled? Basically is going under the ask price a bad thing.Ya it’s badOkaySeems to work in the afternoon, but all morning issues daily...I wish I knew who killed Maude Flanders.I had a right mentor. There were mentors I followed but I didn’t have enough money to sign up for their service. However, eventually I signed up, and I was learning and I started to see improvement in my trading. However, it depends on what type of investor do you want to become? If long term, you might want to focus on fundamental side of the companies. And if you want to do daytrade( I daytrade) you need to focus on 1. chart, 2. find the right pattern to trade. For example: bull flag, or abcd, or reversal, or whatever you want to focus, there are many patterns. You wait and when pattern is formed you take the trade. Next, 3. Focus on high volume stocks with low floats, 4. Look for catalysts, 5. Learn lvl2. 6 learn how to read time and sale. 7. Learn EMA, vwap 8. Looks for daily good set up. In the beginning you would wanna focus on these and as you gain experience you keep adding new strategies and tools. I hope it helps.Options Profit CalculatorNot to take all of your stock buying advice from people on Reddit..I know who killed Mr BurnsIt’s new in the last week. I’ll probably throw some money into ETFs and let it grow.Press and hold down on listing untilnot breaks free then you can drag it to any position in your portfolio or watchlistDrag and drop, same way you would move an app on your homescreenWhy would you buy at ATH?I imagine it's only gonna get higher from here with the new processors and the Xbox and ps5 coming out soonWait for a pullback at least its gone straight up it has to drop again save yourself some moneyThen why wouldn’t you have bought literally any day prior to today?

And the consoles are priced in already, that isn’t new information.I'm selling $15 in the free stocks I got for signing up and signing up others so it's not really a 100% buy out. But as far as my initial question goes, am I buying for the price it was when I put in the order or what it is when the markets open back upBecause today's the day I was able to buy?Did you do a limit order at the $69.27?   If so it will not be executed if the price is higher than that on Monday morning.  If the price is lower it will be executed at market price.  If you entered a market order you will pay the market price on Monday morning which could be most anything up or down.  Good luck.It said market order after I purchased it. Guess I'll just hope and see what happens mondayYou can look at futures late Sunday and get an idea whether it will gap up or down or stay about the same.I like VOO as my growth stock because it tracks the top 50 companies and has a good amount of blue chips and I use SPYD instead of SPHD because it has similar growth with a better dividend yield IMOI would say you’re not diversified at all personally. You’re entirely focused on dividend based stocks. Since you’re here and asking about diversity in a portfolio I’m going to assume your a newer investor. In which case you should not be focused on dividends. The stocks you listed are good for mature investors who don’t have time for growth and need steady income. But over time sacrificing growth dividends means your investment won’t yield as much.

I would say just do a 3 fund portfolio of $VOO/$VT/BND as your main stay.

Also personally I would substitute gold over bonds and use something like $GLD rather than $BND. 

I do like $O because I see good growth from them. Having said that I keep my $O in my IRA where the dividends are not taxed and it allows for more money to come into my portfolio after I’ve maxed out my IRA for the year.Do you think just VOO & SPYD/SPHD would be pretty diversified?Though I am very new to traditional markets, I've been investing in cryptocurrencies since late 2012, so I do have some investing experience.

The goal here is to utilize crypto as my growth vehicle while using dividend stocks to generate monthly income as I've got enough now from getting lucky with crypto, where I could live off of a steady 3% a year for life. 

I appreciate your advice on GLD, does it pay monthly? That's what I'm looking for.If you’re not looking for any growth and only steady dividends then your portfolio is fine. GLD doesn’t give dividends. It’s simply investing in gold rather than bonds.Well that's a bit reassuring, I just want to make sure that these ETFs have a proven track record and are very reliable.Do you think its smart to invest in silver right now?https://www.stocksplithistory.com

This is a good website to see how the stocks done with the past 10 years.

And the nasdaq website is good for checking dividend history.


https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/quotes/dividend-historyI have no insights on the actual stock, but I'd assume smart people cashing out and selling on the news... It had a 52 week low of 35 cents, and the run-up to the news gave it a 52 week high near $2.50.There are a million possible reasons. I don't think anyone can give a clear answer to a question like that.Looks like it might just be taking a lil dip... hang in there it does look to have decent momentum.It wasn't a pump and dump per se, a pump and dump implies that the stock was "pumped" to begin with. This is what we call buying the rumor, selling the news.

There's no bid for that date at $95; $ALK is under $35.

Edit: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ALK210115C00095000?p=ALK210115C00095000I purchased options for expiry at 1/15 at a strike price of $95. When I look at my Schwab account, I see that the value increased by $1.02 for each contract. However, when I look at the bid for the same contract on Robinhood, it’s $.01.Short version: it's worthless.

Chuck is showing you the spread (current ask is $2.25) as of right now and the bid is $0.00. RH is showing you that the contract has no intrinsic value at all and because there's not a single bid at any price, not even the spread is meaningful.

Or do they mail it to you.

The most common thesis is that with ultra-low interest rates, with any sort of inflation real yields on safe bonds will be below zero which makes gold a more attractive option.

 So it's either a great idea and that's what the so called "smart money" is doing.

So I would look into what makes up the majority of their business model and decide what fits best with your ideas. Again, no bad choice really but they are all different entities. I have vdy.to so I have all the top 5 banks in my portfolio just to broaden it a bit.Buy some physicalIntel delaying 7nm again is the reason they're falling.

It's not like much good content gets buried though. I'd say we have a problem with lack of good content rather than an overload of bad content. I'm gonna hazard a guess without looking that you don't make many DD posts here and want to see other people put more effort into posts. I too would love to see high quality stuff but since im not willing toput the effort in why should i criticeze. I think getting some quality posts is necessary before we tell half the current posters to step up or step out.I'm a little shy, but would you mind rating my portfolio as well...take it easy on me ;)

https://imgur.com/a/c1DOf18Hey, can you rate my portfolio -

100% VGROI agree. I was about to make a post about how we're becoming /r/ratemyportfolioI think they should be posted in the daily thread. It is getting excessive.I’ve been doing my DD on XGRO it’s been 4 months now. I’ve just got 5430 holdings left to research.
I’m getting ready to buy soon.Can we just make a bot that says "Why didn't you just buy VGRO?" That's basically the appropriate response to those that aren't really putting effort or research into their portfolio.Discussing it with the mods, may look at alternative options since we can only sticky 2 posts but there is probably something that can be done here.Most of these postings are becoming wsb. They are either meme stocks or vgro. If this is done only show holdings, no price, amount, and profit gain/loss; no need to rub that into anyone's face.I posted a legitimate question about subscription receipts with details about the issue and share price and didn't get a single response. Not even someone saying wtf are you talking about idiot. Not a thing. Meanwhile the shit posts get tonnes of attention. It's not just the OPI don't think it's good

It's usually because they made bad picks or had huge losses so they're already pretty embarrassed to post it anyway

They should be encouraged to post it so people can say how awful it is so they can shape up (shape up for most people being get out of the game and buy VGRO lol)Can we get a megathread for posts complaining about no megathread for “rate my portfolio” posts?Who cares man? Not like this sub is that busy anyway. Just let people post.Agreed. Better yet, limit it to a day a week.Agreed. It's even more annoying when the OP clearly hasn't done any research and is asking for advice (like that guy who's portfolio was like 90% weed stocks). These people are the equivalent of guys who think they're good enough to play in the NBA but haven't even played in a rec league before.

Word to those new at investing, read, study and learn the fundamentals first before you actually put money into the market.100% ZHY.toI yolo dumped 100k into FVI in march at 3 bucks, it is now up 300%. Should i sell? Or yolo to the moon?My portfolio is down 0.032% since I started 3 days ago. What am I doing wrong?These posts are the PFC equivalent to “I have 50K I inherited from my dogs uncles trust fund, what should I do with it?”Cant wait to never click on thatRate my portfolio 100 percent vgroGuys roast my portfolioI find it fun....I'll take those threads over the millionth post about how our lord and saviour VGRO is so great.[deleted]Honestly would be fine with a total ban. Pretty much all of them are utter garbage, full of meme stocks, no diversity, and made with no due diligence whatsoever besides "it's the future" or "its grown a lot already".I downvote that mundane garbage every time I come across one. Confining them to a thread would be an improvement.You should never criticeze imoI think 99.99% of people don't make DD posts here man. I just feel like every "investing" subreddit is slowly becoming wsb/penny stocks esque with how people just beg for get rich quick adviceI'm kinda on this same side. As a relatively new follower/investor, i started following this sub to try to learn. Feels like a bad idea -- sub seems to be bordering on toxic sometimes and not really conducive to learning more than half the timeCan't wait to backtest it ;)Best portfolio post yetSolid portfolio!Looks solid. Amazing color scheme with a nice classic look. You are going places. Keep me updatedLooks like it has some attitude.Need more vgroThose are rookie numbers. Need to use margin to bump that up to ~150%Should add TEC.Since COVID hit, this sub has quickly transitioned into a better-written WSB/BSB, albeit usually avoiding the bragging and memes that make those subs what they are. Scrolling by new, half of the posts are attempted pumps for below-averave stocks with little-to-no DD. These recent posts are further movement along the WSB path.Sure, it’s bad.because I removed them allThere were like 10 this morning before they were all removed by the modsI'd rather have these posts than the daily garbage asking what ETF to buy... this is all the sub has become: what ETF I should buy?It has always been like this. People don’t generally don’t put public DD out there without any financial reason and that can include pumping your own holdings, which is the only thing approaching DD we see on this sub.

You’d have better luck with analyst reports if DD by other people is your thing.Well if you're not willing to put effort into posts then you're in no position to criticize others? Damn straight this is a low effort sub but complaining is going to do jack shit.Yo, a Canadian wsb would be the shitWhoa easy there, this is a family friendly subreddit!!!added more VGRO...

New portfolio - 

100% VGRO. How do i add more bonds with only VGRO?If you see treasure, bury itr/justbuyvgro must be offendedThats like saying someone who subscribes to a newspaper cant say the quality is poor just because they dont write any articles./r/BaystreetbetsKingstreetbetsBuy more VGRO!I mean everyone who visits this sub with any regularity understands the type of posts we get here. Why do we need weekly "no quality posts" posts?yes we are aware but so what? Either contribute or find a sub to your liking?
Fair enough that he wants to voice his opinion but so do I.People pay good money for the newspaper. They have a right to expect quality content.

This is just a free discussion forum.Bank of Canada printer goes brrrrrtbh there has been an extreme spike in rate my portfolio posts
Look at my post history and you can see the ~12 that I removed today


Also, for the same reason that posts that are just like "Thoughts on AC" are removed.still shouldnt be filled with spam or just super low effort screenshots from your phone in my opinion.... what does Rate my portfolio even mean if you arent talking about your age risk goals income etc etc

It doesnt contribute to any kind of real discussionMake it rain!I always assume those are shit posts - and it's usually pretty obvious if it is (and that's maybe a whole other discussion about automods etc). Wallstreetbets leaking and so forth. I would say don't get too worked up about it because the cream rises to the top. Those "rate my portfolio" posts will get no engagement unless there's something interesting to say. And if it's a shitpost and nobody engages - then the trolls *should* stop over time since nobody here gives an F.

And anyone who comes here frequently has gotten good at skimming over the shit entries, check out what's interesting to them, then move on to something else.Who needs gold when you have condos and oil?good thing i got some lolllllwhats the point?

/sThis will prove to be a massive mistake. They sold it on the eve of the massive increase in gold prices in the early 2000s.

Oh well, at least I have net CAD liabilities.>Total holdings in 2015 amounted to approximately 6,350 tons of gold. Relatively little of this gold belongs to the United States Government; as of August 2016, the building's vault holds 13.4 million troy ounces (460 short tons) of gold bullion and $3 million (book value) in gold coins for the United States

> Just saying with tin foil hat on. have a good weekend yall.We need smarter people running government.Something tells me that’s going to change in the near future.They’ve been selling it off to diversify their portfolio for years.  Gold isn’t a great investment long term.  This is nothing more then scare tactics.Yeah, but how much Bitcoin does it have?You've gotta be shitting meGoing back to the gold standard, duhTechnically BOC isn't government. I agree with your statement. Also imagine if politicians controlled i rates lol.Maybe so but we don’t need gold reservesThere is no point to owning gold. It only gains value if other people buy it. It doesn’t do anythingFully agree with your comments. I was long RioCan and stepped away to cover some losses elsewhere. Now wondering whether to come back in before the Q2 results are out which I suspect will increase the stock price. 

Love the high dividend and potential increase in share price. I think Canadian companies have not only weathered the storm better than their US counterparts but have always had good management. 

For me however being so concentrated in real estate has got me thinking. Should I put money in some of the better oil majors. Tbh my only issue again oil is not only the prospects but also the moral issue due to climate change. 

REITS right now seem too good to ignore.Rio here, I think I'll round it out with Smart Centers unless someone has a better compliment.I’m long in RioCan and SRU. Huge dividend and I’m confident the share price will recover.Retail defaults are still increasing month-over-month and so far no sign of a slowdown. The odds of a second shutdown occurring once cold weather and flu season hits in October/November/December are what, 50-50? With that much uncertainty why in god's name would any rational investor go chasing a 5.9% dividend yield from a retail REIT when she can get basically the same yield from a company like NTR that is trading at less than 1x sales, has virtually no risk of meaningful capital loss and zero risk of cutting the dividend. And there are at least a dozen other equally good options.Rio here as well. They are pretty well diversified and have some very interesting projects in the pipeline. REITs will recover but I recommend doing some DD on their tenants.Your portfolio roasts itself.

Hoorah!I think someone gave you incorrect directions. Wall Street Bets is the next town over.Weed stocks...yikes. Your portfolio is a joke in of itself, you don't need us roasting it.Imagine buying a safe blue chip and being downTerrible portfolio rounded off by that turkey of a weed stock. Just buy a few broad index ETF 's and stop trying to beat the market with questionable stock picks.sell it all and buy a single sp500 index fund; find a new hobby.That looks about right for the average Reddit portfolio.Honestly never heard of 6 of the 9 stocks. I have GOOS too, its a long term play. TD is prob your best stock though and you dont want a bank stock as your best unless you are 64 years old.I do like TD and NFIIn a TFSA too. Dang. Next do your RRSP!You're doing a good job matching the Canadian flag with red numbers.Honestly, i just feel bad for you.Just do the opposite I guess?Since when was this r/CanadianGambler lolI love this post !!! We need more like this.Well at least you picked the best CDN MJ play, great average too.Ah weed. FML. Stuck holding it and don’t know how long I’ll have to continue holding it. Same with GOOSlike to see other people's top picks and whyI remember buying PNG for a quick flip, definitely not worth holding long term tho. Where’s NXO in the list!? Fits right in with your repertoire and it’s finally starting to move again

Edit: I’m bag holding $5k worth of LTV so I can’t really talk shitYour portfolio is like school in summer timeWhat did you buy TD at? I’m sure that one will be fine.. sucks to be down 15% though, when did you buy? Pre COVID?This is why I stuck mostly to ETFs. I bought mostly blue chips and I’m still down 15%-20% on those. I feel (some of) your pain.No AC 0/10Thank you to everyone that took the time and consideration to review this and leave some useful feedback.
All the bestIf you’re into Canadian company gambles which it looks like you are, look at $SONA. Yes they’re up like 6000% but I bought two days ago and am up 49%.And how much would you have made if you had VGRO.to instead?Don't worry my friend.  Go for the long term and be patient.  It gonna go back up in a few years.You have 9 stocks and there is no way you can keep up with all their financials. I'd say consolidate your portfolio but it's too late. I doubt you have even viewed the balance sheets for most of the companies. Why not stick with well know companies that have a clear future ahead of them rather than buying random pharmaceutical stocks?Lots of losses.Either you're completely out to lunch or you have some serious insider knowledge.Wtf is thisI have 2.2k in my portfolio.

Read Millionaire Teacher by Andrew Hallem to help you through the decision.I think after $100K you need to start using a laptop/desktop ;)Your first mistake is was using TD DIYou definitely bought at the peak; pre covidThrow in some silver Junior mining companies in there... portfolio will be up soon enough (every mining company I own...10 of them are up a minimum of 2x since March/April lows...some which I don't own are already 20x and higher...and silver just hit a 7 year high and gold is $30 USD away from ATH). Also, I've learned that holding or selling stocks is more psychological than anything. I now get rid of anything if I can't give myself a rational reason for having them...and just liking a company or the product etc. Is most certainly not part of my decisions. All the best on the journeyNice meme stonks, needs US positionsYou managed to lose money in the largest bull run we have seen in a long while.

At least /r/wallstreetbets has fun while losing money.Gold miners are the only Canadian stocks I really own.

This is why.

A fool and his money part easily.It’s been up significantly high in the last few months. They are being taken private by the end of August for 1.82 a share. Which is 3 cents from its current trading price of 1.79.It’s made him 2k though lolBecause that's where I've made most the money in the portfolio 🤣. Just under 20k since FebGold mineHaha... same reactionPretty sure I've seen their commercials on BNN.All gold mines are probably decent investments right now.  With interest rates 0 or low for the foreseeable future, gold will be high for the foreseeable future.  Leading to good profits and dividends.YoloThis is the funniest thing I’ve seen all dayBrb creating an 10x inverse saijin94 ETF.Lmao am guilty of this oneFor iOS users: https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/tailor-screenshot-stitching/id926653095It's built in to android if you have a SamsungThis sub will shit on anyone not 100% VGROWSB users buy options, not random stocks and pray they go upand that’s what he’s up on lol.Name 2 or 3 broad index ETF’s. Asking for a friend.This is much sounder advice given his current state.They're up on the weed stock thoughHonest question. I keep seeing people who like that stock. I have no concept of who their selling to in an economic downturn so I would not invest.  What's your rationale?I did too until I saw this portfolio.I just can't quit NFI and it hurts.Lol, no need to pump your holdings😂HahaSame. $CWEB bag holder here. Down 50%.VGROSona to $100 heard it here first/r/justbuyvgroYa I already knew it was bad because it wasn't just 1 stock.

Just under 2k GUY brought me up to 20k in a hurry going into MayTd is the only good stock you have yet you somehow lost money on that too? Welcome to r/wallstreetbetsI appreciate your time and consideration. I'll do some homeworkWhyyyy are you being downvoted. I made 9k yesterday on gold miners. I’m up over 300% on a few, 200% on a few more and over 100% on the rest. Anyone who thinks gold is a bad investment today is a fucking fool.Your account is not old enough

Thank you and you are welcomeThat's a weak roastThat's been there for 2 years plusOne plus 7 ProHow about post yours to be fair?My average cost is mid 70s in td :(pre covid buyshe;d have a better chance consolidating all of these shares and buying cineplex instead of 9 random stocks nobody knows about lolLmao snap, fb, and virgin>Stop mucking about with those penny stocks.

Goes on to recommend SPCE, SNAP, WEED, and PTON>fortis 

i had a chance to buy snap at 16 but i snapped out of itEven the just buy VGRO haters have to admit that its better than this monsterI feel your pains, I started investing a couple days before the crash. Thank god I didn’t lump sum.Literally everything I owned was red at the lows in MarchA Motley fool and his money part easily. 

FTFY.Cash out now then. I held on to cineplex for the extra 80 cents that was coming for the sale, and we all know how that turned out!Buying a bunch of a random thing you don’t know about is just gambling. Winning the slots isn’t a defender of gamblingLmk ticker when it's done, I'm all in babyShould we average down?Same for Lgwtf how. I had no idea. Mind blown.I spat my drink out the other day of a dude bragging on WSB he made 2 pence profit on Tesla. They got some solid memes there.r/justbuyvgroXgroXAW and VCN /literally the entire world for .2% MER and .05% MERIts one of the few Canadian brands with a global presence. I’ve seen their coats in Europe, Asia, and the states. Would I personally drop $1000 on a winter coat? Nope, but they have tons of consumer cache whether you like them or not. Due to current economic events, most people dont have that kind of $ to drop on a winter coat but I believe they are gonna do a massive expansion. This is stock that was double value before covid hit. Its a long term hold for 2 years down the road.I don't think their customers have been affected by the downturn. Their coats aren't that expensive when you consider the other luxury goods their customers buy, plus the coats really are high quality, materials and manufacturing. The demand for their product is high enough that they are never sold at discount and all sales are direct from manufacturer, no profit goes to middleman retailers.This portfolio is a train wreckIs it even possible to pump TD? It’s one of the oldest and easily recognized stocks on the TSXTD? Never heard of it, will check out now that this guy pumped it up!I'm not those are blue chip stocksWould you buy it today at the current price? If not sell it. The fact that you're 50% down shouldn't have anything to do with your decision to hold on to it. Even if it returns to your purchase price, you will have suffered opportunistic loss.seriously man you work hard for your money. maybe its all memes to you but at the end of the day seriously do research or consult a financial advisor if you need help ...Just wait until gold hits ATH and silver continues exploding. Big money isn’t even in metals miners yet. Wait for that and then dumb retail and hold on tight.NO JUST KEEP INVESTING IN RIOCAN, BROOKFIELD, AND THE CANADIAN BANKS YOU FOOLOut of curiosity, why are you doing miners and not pure gold ETF?Who you in? I am up 53% on KRR and 163% on PGM. Only mistake of KRR (in hindsight of course) was not selling at 1.18 and not loading more at 0.25 mid march. Made some good coin on TMR but fml I sold WM at a loss but had I held I would've 4x it.

Also own Coke, Kirkland Lake, Walmart, Mcdonalds (again), CSW and VGRO BABYI'm actually looking to do the same, and coincidentally, my portfolio is looking a lot like yours heha 165 year old bank feels like a gamble?Money over 10 years > money over a day or weekI have the exact one. Was wondering why it's so similar jajaja.~24% FIE

~20% Energy (AQN, RWN, ENB)

~17% XGRO/XEQT

~11% XRE

~9% HMMJ

~5% DIV

The remaining ~14% is a mix of GRN, DYA, and XBC. 

This is probably only about 1/4 of my investments, my DIY portion. Also have roboinvestments, mutual funds that I'll move later, and shares from work shares program.

Ideally I want to get to about 50% dividend and 50% growth in my DIY portfolio, but want a bit of dividend base to help increase future buys a bit. Still learning, and moving things around.I bought at 6 and sold at 9, and my buddy who bought at 6 roasts me as he's still holding it today at 20 or whatever it is. 

Last time I checked, SNAP still hasn't made any profit?Yeah I actively invest, but this is a whole list of speculationsIt's not such a big deal you would only be down a few percent  and over 10-20 years it would be nothing

Meanwhile you would have been earning dividends so if you did something ordinary like lump sumed all VGRO or VEQT you would have been fine that 1% "loss" is meaningless

It's possible with the dividends you would have broke even, and absolutely true based on your hourly rate the stress the time checking it etc etc.But how else am I supposed to decide what to do with my 6000 TFSA dollars /sOh yeah definitely. I took my +30% and got the hell out as soon as I got the merger papers.Buying anything in the market is a gamble, nothing is guaranteed. How are your students btwUp to you. I won't because i already have a sizeable amount in this stock and im hesitant to put more in it. id rather put my money elsewhere. My purchase amount was around 2.5kIf you take a screenshot there should be an arrowYeah, but they’re also a trend. Trends tend to be frothy for a while and then pop. A wave towards sustainability and animal rights from the right influencers may hurt its outlook. Personally not for me.Different investment strategies.  I dont invest in consumer goods I wouldnt buy, or trendy shit that the bottom can fall out from at the whim of some fashion.
Im not good at riding the waves if you couldnt tell!They sell coats, how much upside could there be?Just reminds me of something like Vuarnet.Needed a shower after seeing it🤦🏽‍♂️Could be a 10 bagger!Good point. I’ve been considering selling it almost every day but I never pull the trigger on it. I’ve waited this long already so I may hold on a little longer til earnings.I am waiting. I’m fully fucking loaded. 75% gold / silver & copper miners. 25% cash. I’m up $10’s of thousands in the last few weeksVolatility. Low floats. I like making 2-10x my initial investment.I am in a bunch. IPT, GGD, SVE, OCG, GTCH, NGD, SVM, AGC, NEE, BHS to name the ones off the top of my head. Copper miners have been good to me since April as well.'If you have $5000 in your TFSA you need to buy this stock right now!!!! (which we already own, please pump)'You can’t genuinely think that buying a random companies shares you know nothing about is the same as something like a snp500 index fund.Students are good I hope!! Miss then over the summer. I’m sure they are all on tender hooks as we await ministry guidelines for the fall reopening (or not!)I'm holding as well. Was really hoping the reopening and crude going back up and going to make it slowly go up, but I was wrongThank you... little annoyed I didn't already know this lolIf you have followed the company closely they are working very hard to move their product line away from their traditional fur-trimmed garments. It takes a *lot* of digging to even find pictures of fur-trimmed CG jackets on their social media.

I love my CG *because* of the warmth and fur trim, and I don't see the point at *all* in buying light CG jackets. But lots of people seem to disagree.i don't know, could be a lot, lululemon sells stretchy pants and its up 1600% since IPO, or like 70% in the last year.Not everthing has to be a trillion dollar company like the big fiveI need an anal cleansing after seeing this. Why would someone make these decisions?What miner stocks have you up 200% to 300%?  Barrick was 28.19 on May 5, and is 28.24 today...Lol exactlySure, it's a valiant effort, but they can't shake the general market perception and their reputation. They're also not moving away from goose down anytime soon which animal rights activists hate along with the fur. 

Canada Goose was the king of coats for years, but then Moncler seemingly came out of nowhere and has become the desired brand of choice by the market willing to spend a ton on coats thanks to one Drake music video. Parajumpers, Nobis, Mooseknuckles, they all came shortly after the Canada Goose hype peaked. Market's gotten too crowded and unpredictable for me. I like the brand and the product. I own a Goose jacket personally as I live downtown Toronto and walk most places. The warmth, quality, and warranty are great, I'll give them that. Last winter, I saw more Moncler coats and fewer Gooses downtown. Anecdotal I admin, but it may indicate a trend.It's not just the fur lining though, right? Afaik their coats are insulated with downLululemon sells full athleticwear lines, it's ceiling is as high as underarmor, champion, or even nike/adidas if they really struck gold. Canada Goose is jackets and sweaters... I can't think of any company that only makes coats and sweaters that I'd be interested in holding for 40 years.  They need to become a broader fashion line or they will die.  You can also google for images of fur factories and see how you feel about Canada Goose running those.Ggd, ipt, gtch, ocg are a fewAnimal activists hate goose down, but regular people don't particularly care. The problem for CG is that a lot of regular people who don't otherwise care about animals very much *do* object to fur trims. 

Also, you're very wrong about Moncler's popularity being derived from Drake. I have some very rich fashion-forward friends and Moncler was already the most popular coat brand in their circles *before* that Drake video.

Toronto is definitely on the downswing in terms of CG saturation. Peak CG was like 2008 in Toronto imo. But globally, it's definitely still a brand with increasing cachet.While this is true, those who object to down are a much smaller group than those who object to fur trims. I think it's just the superficial in-your-face nature of the latter that makes them more of a target. Also the fact that fur comes from animals that generally look somewhat cute, or with whom it is easier to empathize.Fair enough, that's a pretty good distinction between the two companies. And when you out it that way I see how a person could/would be wary of investing in GOOSi think what they were trying to say about drake and moncler is that the non rich people who would usually buy goose jackets because of the trend started buying Moncler instead. Moncler has always been popular with the rich but it only recently became popular with those who shouldn’t be spending $1500 on a winter jacket.>Also the fact that fur comes from animals that generally look somewhat cute, or with whom it is easier to empathize.

Yeah, coyotes look like dogs so people get upset. Wonder if cows looked more like dogs if people would be more against eating beef :SExactly what I’m saying. One well placed endorsement and a smaller brand grows and becomes the trend. That’s adds too much risk for me to invest.The fact everyone thinks we're about to get a pullback is giving me doubts it's going to happen.Best way for Canadian to invest in gold?Gold is rising because of demand and because USD is falling. Double tailwind. All in gold and silver.According to the Inflation Calculator, the 1980 high of US $850 translates into US $2,659.31 today, so we've still got a fair distance to go to reach and potentially break the all time high.  Can't wait.What is the horizontal axis measuring?Interesting that you say that. I kinda have the opposite feeling. Gold seems to be getting quite a bit of enthusiasm here on reddit lately. You could be quite right, of course.Equities, gold producers.  Mining companies like Newmont, Yamana and Alamos have had nice returns and dividend growth recently.

Alternatively,  physical gold can be purchased from online sellers. xau.com and eBay are two places to find physical that's available as there are shortages currently.More stimulus = bigger bubble and more inflation  


Gold & silver are getting ready to **run**Time of day (EST).I'm referring more to market commentators and people who have been in the sector for years.

Definitely more interest here than I've ever seen.  I'm usually more comfortable owning what people hate.**I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**

I also think that the general confidence in governments and financial systems around the world is eroding and that's what is making people load up on gold since it's nobody else's liability and doesn't depend on a third party being solvent.  

Things are creaking and groaning.  Remember the days when the Fed could jawbone an interest rate statement to provoke a profound reaction in the markets?  They have long ran out of anything they can do now other than buying government debt, private bonds and possibly stocks directly to prop the US economy up.  Neither of those intervention methods are exactly great for instilling confidence in the government's ability to clean up the current mess.If interest rates are raised, institutions will have incentive to pull their money from equities into other investment vehicles, and then it's bye bye bull market.   


Call spreads on SLV and/or GLD are definitely a great hedge for these uncertain times.You should probably be comparing the dividends to their recurring Funds from operations (FFO) or Adjusted EBITDA. You can see these figures in their presentation files at the investor relations part of the company website. The net income isn’t a good representation of how they are doing since it may include a lot of one-time events/costs, or depreciation costs on assets that aren’t a good representation of their actual maintenance costs.Follow Up question. Since there's a split coming up. Should those interested in the spin off BEPC just wait till it becomes available due to the historical 10% difference from their other spin off assets?I would look at EV/FCF.

You can also dig deeper and look at their PPA (power purchase agreements) to determine how they are being paid and the length of their contracts.> due to the historical 10% difference from their other spin off assets?

They have done two of these splits already. Only one trades any differently, and it has only existed for 4 months. There is no "historical difference from their other spin off assets". One split entity trades a bit differently, and has only done so for a few months, with no way to know if that keeps up. The other split is identical in price (9 cent difference as I type this).We've been seeing these headlines since early 2000's.  While it's undeniable that the USD status is eroding together with America's slow diminishing political and economical dominance, but right now and in the the near future - what other game is there other than USD and US Treasuries?  I just don't see another market with enough capacity to quickly absorb insane amounts of global capital trying to find a place to be invested in today's crazy turbulent times.

China's is on its way up but its ascent is very gradual, they will take a long time before China can be viewed as an open and safe economy with the same global reach the US has enjoyed for decades now.  Unless there's a major domestic political instability (possible) in the US very soon, or an actual threat of US being involved in a shooting war with a powerful enemies (China, Russia, Iran), good ole Murica will probably remain the first choice for global investments.No.Pretty much.  People (especially young people on reddit and other social media) have a hard-on for the downfall of America, but the fact is that it's just not going to happen any time soon.

China is really going to need to clean up its act, and from the look of things that's going to be many decades in the making.  For all outside appearances, they've barely progressed on openness and human rights during my lifetime.  It would honestly not be surprising to see another Tiananmen Square-style incident even today.USD is losing its safe haven status. Usually in uncertain times it goes up with other safe havens like gold, now gold is at its highest point ever and usd is at its lowest point since 2018 and still going down with a bunch of other currencies. That's what happens when you print money and run deficits.I think Gold will be the new global reserve currency. This is what happens when no fiat currency is dominant. If you need to trade between currency blocs, you would need a currency that is  not a liability of anyone.

Gold becoming a new reserve currency would imply much higher gold prices. At current prices gold cannot possibly absorb enough capital.

The rampant use of financial sanctions is making the USD too politically risky as a reserve currency. Using the USD in international transactions means that you get the US government as a third party in any transaction involving the USD. What will likely happen instead is that international trade will be conducted in a multitude of currencies with gold as the reference price.

So a contract would specify that you can pay with your choice of any among a basket of currencies, with the price being the equivalent of a fixed quantity of gold.NGL I'm really enjoying the self destruction of America

What a time to be alive>gold is at its highest point ever

I root for gold, but it needs to be noted that according  to the Inflation Calculator, the 1980 high of US $850 translates into  US $2,659.31 today, so we've still got quite a bit to go before we reach and potentially break the all time high.>I think Gold will be the new global reserve currency.

This could never work.  For once, central banks won't ever allow a reserve currency that they:

A. Can't print

B. Can't float/control

But even if they would, the entire world's gold is worth what, around $10T?  US GDP alone was like twice that last year.  How much of the world's gold is possession of central banks? Diddly squat, compared to the size of the world economy.  Besides, any currency-gold peg is bound to fail since there's no way on God's green earth that governments would suddenly adopt financial discipline, stop overspending and somehow manage to maintain a fixed ratio of any currency to gold.

They'll eventually replace the dollar, but it won't be gold or anything tangible.  It'll be some digital currency that they can issue at will, control and, more importantly - trace, so that they can get their grubby hands in everybody's pocket.It's not about what central banks want, it's about what is feasible. If central banks think they can print however much money they want and everyone will just suck it up, they will be very surprised. 

There around 20,000 tons of gold reserves available in the world. In practice we don't need gold backing for every single unit of currency out there. We only need the fraction that is used to conduct international trade between currency blocs. Within countries/currency bloc, standard fiat currency will still be used.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_foreign-exchange_reserves

There are roughly $15T worth of global reserve assets held by central banks around the world. This works out to roughly $750/g for gold, vs $60/g today.

This of course assumes that we have capital controls to prevent massive conversion of capital assets into gold. Otherwise we would need to price gold high enough to account for capital asset values. In that case the price of gold may have to be 100x higher.

In practice, most countries that run balanced trade will not need much gold reserves. Reserves are mainly an unit of account between countries that run massive trade imbalances with each other.BMO, CNR, CTC-AVEQT and XEQT.HBU, HGUHGU is lots of volumeRelated: HZU (2x leverage) and HUZ for Silver.I believe that Brookfield Office Properties is a subsidiary of Brookfield Property Partners, BPY.UN on the TSX. You would have to contact your broker to see if your shares can transfer to Brookfield Property Partners LP Units (BPY.UN).

[https://bpy.brookfield.com/en/resources/brookfield-canada-office-properties](https://bpy.brookfield.com/en/resources/brookfield-canada-office-properties)

After reading the press release, it looks like BPY called in (redeemed) outstanding shares of Brookfield Office Properties at 32.50$ a unit in 2017. I'm not sure how you still have the shares in your account and not noticed this earlier.Thank for for providing the above link... it is very strange. I just made the transfer and it definitely had a value prior to transfer. Further, I received the "offer" documents, which does mention the "Exchange LP Units"... it is not clear whether it trades 1:1. I do think these may be different than the ones mentioned in the release because those are "Canada" office properties. Whereas mine is simply Office Properties, without "Canada".

Thank you for your input and taking your time to respond.Lovely paywall. 

I’m a holder of the banks. If nothing else, that’s all we are in Canada. LolRule 1 of the TSX : Don't  bet against the banksGotta hold Canadian banks since they are not going anywhere anytime soonLol the truth is if banks in Canada (one of the most resilient) go down, it will be every man for themselves. Ever watch madmax?"until it has been resolved"?  sorry but ROFL!

 There is ALWAYS, ALWAYS an unresolved problems.  The good companies solve them.  That bad companies don't.  What makes this any different?

You buy when things are really bad. This isn't bad yet.  If things are really good, the stock is too expensive.Hold, DRIP, and buy the dips.

Canadian banks are the sort of thing you hold for most of the rest of your life.This was priced in months ago.

Didn't you look at Q1 earnings?Such a fantastic opportunity to get these high value companies at a discount.Was up 7-10% on banks and sold everything (TD, RY, CWB) over last week. Reinvested in miners. I see banks going sideways or slightly down as the USA works its stuff out. They had 1000 more deaths today (148k total). Projected to get to 208k - 219k by Nov 1st.  


I see making healthy profit on gold and then easing back into banks in 4 months when we're still in the same situation.What banks is everyone buying these days? Or what has the best outlook post covid based on the industries they're in?They put aside a few billions for bad loans already. Despite doing this, they still made billions in profit.HOLD THE LINEi own a couple of banks and they keep churning out dividends and (some) growth. with a drip on, i don't think you'll ever shake me off.Even if the banks go down a bit or remain flat for the foreseeable future you’ll still be getting a very safe 5 to 6% yield while waiting for them to return to pre covid pricesBought about $10k of RBC at $87/share in my RRSP and holding till retirement.He who controls the spice, controls the universeIn my humble opinion, they will all cut their dividends, as cash preservation becomes paramount, and the share price will fade accordingly.Adding content to Pocket (getpocket) gets around many paywalls.

>Canada’s Big Six banks face growing loan losses as government support programs wind down and loan-deferral and interest-rate relief programs for consumers come to a halt.  
>  
>Banks have been gearing up for big losses from loan defaults that could arise from the COVID-19 pandemic’s economic hit, as millions of Canadians lost their jobs and businesses shut down to comply with physical distancing measures. Canada’s big banks have already booked about $11-billion of provisions for credit losses in anticipation of projected losses from an array of debt, such as credit cards, credit lines, mortgages and other loans.  
>  
>Despite the economic plunge, consumers have so far remained largely current with their debt obligations. Personal insolvencies are below average and credit payments have remained stable.  
>  
>That stability has been made possible by extensive government programs, such as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit for people out of work and a wage subsidy provided to hard-hit businesses to keep staff working. The CERB, however, is set to expire in the fall and the wage subsidy is set to end in December.  
>

>“The main concern is that the economy is going to change in a post-COVID world, and many sectors and jobs may take a very long time to come back or not come back at all,” Jason Mercer, a Moody’s vice-president and senior analyst, said in an interview.  
>  
>The question is whether Canada’s banks have already booked enough provisions to cover loan losses down the road. Canada’s banks have allowed hundreds of thousands of customers facing financial stress to defer payment on a variety of loans, including more than $250-billion of mortgages. It’s not clear how many of those customers will be unable to fully catch up on their payments when the deferrals end.  
>  
>“I would suspect that we will see more provisions in the third quarter, but likely not as severe as the second because the economy has partially reopened since,” Mr. Mercer said. “Longer-term, future losses will depend on the duration of the crisis and whether we will be able to reopen more of the economy or be forced to reclose sectors if the pandemic worsens.”  
>  
>The banks’ full potential for credit losses is not “fully baked in” despite the $11-billion in provisions already set aside, Nigel D’Souza, an analyst at Veritas Investment Research, said in a report last month.

>“We expect impaired loans to drive peak credit losses during this cycle. Impairments typically do not peak at the start of a recession and tend to lag as economic stresses mount,” he said. “We expect provisions to move higher over the coming quarters as deferrals and government support programs wind down.”  
>  
>Each bank has a different mixture of loans in its portfolios – making provisions a tricky calculation. In addition, in late 2017, a new accounting standard called IFRS 9 has made forecasting losses even more complicated, requiring banks to divide provisions into two broad categories.  
>  
>One is for impaired loans, which are in arrears, but haven’t yet been written off as losses. The other is for performing loans, which are still being paid back, but are deemed at risk of becoming impaired based on economic forecasts and financial models.

Haha at that point no one will care about stocks and currency ;)I'd say it depends on what you're trying to invest in.  Below is how I see most of the big banks:

* Royal (RY) - has the most Canadian based exposure (largest mortgage holder in the country by a decent margin)
* TD - has good exposure to the US - good investment options through e-series funds
* BNS - has good Caribbean exposure (also second largest Canadian mortgage holder)
* BMO - is the only bank with high quality ETF options that can compete with ishares/blackrock
* CIBC (CM) - no comment - I don't know much about their operationsI bought TD for American exposure and BNS because I wanted to.TD and BNSI’ve got $11k sitting in my RBC RRSP account sitting there doing nothing. Wondering if I should pull the plug and buy some as well or not....RemindME! 6 months "Banks cut dividends?"RY is an extremely well diversified company and also have significant operations in the US. The majority of Canadians only see the Canadian P&CB operations but the bank has significant operations in insurance, wealth management & US wealth management, and with the "recent" acquisition of City National Bank is a private bank for very high net worth clients in the US, investor & treasury services (London+BENELUX), and is the worlds 10th largest investment bank (RBC capital markets). 

As of late BNS and RBC have been divesting their Caribbean footprint with branch closures and sales to local Caribbean banks. BNS is however doubling down on their LATAM presence where they are betting on big growth in those emerging markets. BMO and CM  are both increasing their footprints to get larger pieces of the US pie with BMO Harris Bank and CM's recent purchase of PrivateBancorp.

Canadian banks are extremely well run companies and heavily diversified with near bulletproof (TD/RBC as G-SIBS) balance sheets. They are all good long-term investments.Bns yield is looking good these days.Between that, TD, RIOCAN and Telus I have some hefty yields primed to hit my bank :)That's awesome, I'm looking to get some Canadian yields in my portfolio. My portfolio as it stands only consists of 70% XAW 20% VFV and 10% VRE. I have some extra cash kicking around at the moment and would really like to buy a few shares of a bank. I'm glad you're making the yield work for you!I moved my CIBC to IB 2 years ago. You just fill out the online form after you make the ib account.I’m on the hunt for something better than IE it’s trash lately

I’m not familiar with IBKR? It looks pretty sophisticatedWhere can I find the online form? I was able to find the tranfer position page but it doesn't include CIBC Investors Edge.It's less complicated than you think. Their mobile app is very good, rest of the platforms are so so. Just open a demo account and try their app.I agree your opinion about IE. I did some trading using IB and am paying the monthly fee plus market data fees. As I am paying already for IB fees, there's no point for me to keep the CIBC account.Should be CIBC world markets. But you should confirm with the live chat.It's in the forms centre. Form should be 2033.Yes you can.  Use online banking and callsTry wealthsimpleNo... at least not an option with TD, as soon as I changed my address I was no longer allowed to make any tradesYes it's open from one endI dont follow this stock but from what you're saying it sounds like the typical buy the rumor, sell the news reaction. Plus stocks were dumping this morning.The release of the EIS isn't the biggest hurdle. The army corps of engineers still have to give it their green light which happens in no less than 30 days. This was the classic buy the hype, sell the news deal. If you weren't out by weds/thurs, you weren't really in tune with what was going on. This whole project has BIG risk and even if the USACE gives it their blessing, it will take 2-3 year just for permits. If Trump loses and bumblin' Biden wins, the whole project could be shut down anyway.

This stock will continue to fall the next couple of weeks, even out and then pump again for the USACE report. Even if you want to be long in this stock, you will find much better entry points in the coming weeks/months. 

All just my opinionthis would be great. been 100% WFH for almost three years, but my employer won't fill out a T2200 because they don't "require" me to WFH.where is my tax break for having to work for the whole damn pandemic, from work.Anyone have experience with this tax deduction and have a more detailed breakdown of what is included?

In BC I assume: bc hydro, fortis, telus internet cost (is my tv package not included?), and home office consumables. 

For utilities, what percentage of the total cost should we expect in a return?

Rent surprised me. Any insight on how rent or mortgage comes into play would be great.

Thank you!I’d love a tax break for going to work during the pandemic!My employer requires work from home, but flatly refuses to sign T2200 (https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2200.html). HR explained that Canadian regulations has a major loophole and company is using it.

Basically, employers can press certain working conditions onto employees, but not required to sign off the tax form related to those conditions (no provisions to compel employers to do so).Lucrative? How are people getting big tax breaks here? I claimed a work from home space for years (portion of rent, heating/water, internet etc.) and it would be laughable what I got back. Usually like $100 tops.I honestly hope that this doesn’t get changed 

Selfishly of course I’d love a tax break, but to be honest the government has a lot better use of resources than providing tax breaks to white collar workers who ‘did their part’ by staying home....do something for front line workers insteadThis is extremely dumb. It’s not a tax break. It’s that you don’t pay taxes on your income-earning expenses - and it’s not new. For an investing sub, there’s a terrifyingly low level of comprehension of basic tax matters!Lol "lucraritive tax break" ummm or not work and recieve free 2k... people working and keeping the economy alive get nothing.Anyone know what I need to do to get this? I've been WFH all year.a lot of people dont know the ins/out of the expense claims.  Basically you claim a proportionate amount of your home expenses (rent/utilities/maintenance) based on your office size/home size.  This forms a deduction of your income on your taxes, so to get the cash back amount multiply the calculated home costs by your tax rate.

Wouldn't those of us still going to work be the ones deserving of a tax break?God, I hope so. We are contract workers working from home for a university.It's so sad that essential workers are excluded from any type of tax break.Just plain dumb. Don't waste money on stupid things like this. I understand covid comes with costs, but this is just nothing more than vote buying to me[deleted]Someone needs to pay for Mr. Trudeau next exotic vacationsso dumb, it has literally no effect to the employer.

once the pandemic started i told all my staff that ill sign the 2200 for WFH if they want. i wont be preparing them, they can prepare themself and ill sign off hahaWhat do you mean, they don't  "require" you to work from home? Is that not the case?Any idea how much you’d get back if they did ?Exactly ! I know boredom is a thing , but seeing all these posts about people making sourdough bread and counting their ceiling tiles is making me kind of salty. Everyone is talking about all their new hobbies and how well they are doing mentally and I am so jealous.[deleted]Man fuck this gov fuck this world fuck it all i don't wanna be apart if this planet its full of fucking retards the dumb ppl are outfucking the smart ppl and its killing us all. I wanna go live in Mars fuck earth and its bullshitRent but not mortgage.... maybe interest on mortgage?It's miniscule. Like not even worth the time. Pretty sure mine came to $83Following.For items like rent/interest expense or hydro the size of the *dedicated* workspace as a proportion of your home would be used to calculate the workplace allocation of those expenses.i posted this above

No internet, this is considered a fixed cost. Yes to other utilities, property tax. Someone below says no to mortgage interest, I thought that was ok - check for yourself. Yes to cleaning. 

I was able to take this about a decade ago, at the time I found a list.That's a dick move by said company. Maybe if you can quantity it you can get all of your coworkers to push for the company to make you whole (pay you for the tax benefit you are entitled to but not getting because the company is taking it instead).Do they require it in your employment contract?It's not even worth your time, man.i just posted a simple calc above

>I would guess most people should be able to claim more than that. eg a super simple calc is rent at 1,500/month x 12 months x 10% home office space x 30% tax rate = $540

and you arent even meant to claim internet ;)It’s not a handout for WFH. It’s under the theory that money spent in order to earn money should not be taxed. I.e. your employer gets a “tax break” by paying your salary. That’s not a handout, that an expense that they have incurred and shouldn’t be paying tax on. (Yes, yes, payroll taxes, it’s just an illustrative example).The WFH tax credit is for home-expenses, based on the percentage of your house that you are using for work. This is exactly what it's for.Totally agree. 

I am working from home full time.  I don't need a tax break. I am already saving so much money on gas + going out for lunch/coffee.What's the definition of a tax break really? Most people have a desk or something at home, they're paying for home internet, condo fees, utilities, etc. Working from home gives you the opportunity like you said to write off these expenses that have now become income earning expenses. I haven't added any net new expenses this year, I'll just get to write off some existing ones. I think the title is fine.Your contract must specify that you are required to work from home.

Then you need to request your employer fill out a form T2200. The form will state "10. Did this employee's contract of employment require them to use a portion of their home for work?" and your employer needs to check yes.

Keep a copy of this form on file, and fill out the employment expenses portion of your tax return for use of home.Your account is not old enough

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/CanadianInvestor) if you have any questions or concerns.*So you already get this tax break.Same, working from home rocks. Nothing is preventing you from telling your employer's your being overworked. Take breaks, go outside, go take a walk to the cafe. Working from home gives me freedoms I couldn't attain any other way. I don't need work to socialize and if you do, well take a cold hard look.Why? Nothing’s changed for us. If there was no pandemic we’d commute daily regardless.

Whereas those who work from home likely had to buy new equipment chairs computers internet service to be able to work from homeHow is it vote buying? This isnt a new tax creditThere was plenty to complain about re waste, but this is an existing deduction.How, exactly, are you being shafted by long-existing tax laws?i quit, moved, and reacquired the job. they're not wrong, they're just assholes*

* about this, mostly they're good.It needs to be a condition of employment, aka in your contract.not really; i did a dry-run of the process before they rejected my request and if memory serves you basically calculate your "work space" (ideally an office) as a ratio of the total square footage of your home, then use that ratio to calculate it's proportion of your mortage/utilities/etc. i think mine came out to around $5K/yr for me, but i have no idea if that's a direct reduction of your taxable income or not.I'm working full time from home and I'm not doing super well mentally. I'm losing my absolute mind quarantining and working from home. Im working more and having less time for hobbies because there's always work to do and having access to my systems at home makes it easier to just say "screw it, I'll just get it done". The grass is always greener[deleted]There'a a difference between people on temporary layoffs and WFH.

I'm WFH and am working harder and more hours than I have at any other time in my life. I would return to the office quite happily.

On the plus side, my wife is working from home too, and having lunch together daily has been nice.If it makes you feel better, nobody who is counting their ceiling tiles is doing well mentallyHow you're doing mentally is up to you. I don't discount the fact that you're under stress, that there are things out of your control right now, that shit sucks, but being salty about other people who live an entirely different life from yours is a losing game and is probably just going to make you perform worse, make poorer decisions, and be unhappy. Think about what you do have, what is going well, what optimism lies in the future (even the tiniest amount/type), and focus on the things you actually have control over.Haven't been able to get yeast for the longest time, I wanna make bread!People working from home could very well have "full employment" too, saving perhaps 2 hours each day in travel, not to mention travel expenses.   While the government got rid of the public transit tax credit years ago at the expense of daily commuters.no interestMortgage interest is allowable on rental properties, but not on home office.You need to understand you're in the minority. I've seen you post this twice.
Did you include all your internet, property tax, home insurance, water, heat, electric, maintenance  supplies, etc?I would guess most people should be able to claim more than that. eg a super simple calc is rent at 1,500/month x 12 months x 10% home office space x 30% tax rate = $540Perfect question.Nope, it is all goody in the contract. As I said, they are smart about it. Basically they ask you to work from home temporarily and just make sure it stays that way.

In my understanding, this kind of tax breaks designed not to be available. Government offering tax break, while knowing very few can actually use it. Grossly unfair, but what else to expect from Trust Fund kids running the show these days. They got their money, they do not care about working people.If you rent your at a serious advantage over someone with a mortgage.What are you referring to about not claiming internet?Yea, why do only rich assholes get to have tax breaks? I've been self-employed for over 10 years of my career. The very modest tax break helps.I've worked from home for years.

I need a tax break.

I need every economic advantage I can get because I wasn't born with a  silver spoon.A tax break implies a deduction for something specific or out of the ordinary. The concept of not paying taxes on expenses to earn income is a fundamental concept. 

A desk isn’t eligible to be claimed as an expense. For many people, home internet and utilities have gone way, way up from WFH (of course). Why should they be paying tax on these expenses anymore than a bakery should pay taxes on their hydro bill? 

“I already have a car, I don’t see why I should get reimbursed for mileage”Are you sure you need it to have it in an employment contract and 2200? Not my experience.The new equipment would not be covered sadly, only supplies and services.Oh, i dont know... maybe the fact that we exposed ourselves and our families to the virus by having to go into work?too bad they got rid of the public transit tax credit. sucks for commutersI love it when people who have no idea about something have strong opinions about it.Clearly I didn't read lol[deleted]lolDude don't sweat it. Not even CLOSE to 5k. I went through all the hassle last year and think I got like $83

Edit: lol you don't get to include mortgage payments!!!Ya, don't worry about it. Every few years I get amped app to get my deduction but as an employee with a home office you can't claim very much. It's always less than $100 I would see in my pocket. Now if you are a contractor, that's different...its a straight deduction so multiply that by your top-ish tax rate.  eg at 30% thats $1,500 back.  but note you dont include your mortgage, so your numbers may be offI'm also fairly certain you need to meet some criteria like having clients come to visit you? You can't just be a solo person working at home to make anything back.

EDIT: ignore this, I can’t read. One of the two conditions is meeting clients. Only one condition is required. Carry on.Yeah, it becomes really hard to separate life and work when it's all done in the same place.I’m leaving mine. Work got horrible and I don’t sleep. But depends on the work I think.I miss people, the communication has gone down hill too for my wfh job.Seems like a you problem and not knowing how to set boundaries at home. I don’t answer emails after 5:30/6 period. Go for walks and/or work out.Same thing... but the money is too good to pass up. So I try to keep sane by telling myself it's temporary, and I will have my downpayment for my first place sooner than I expected..Keep yourself healthy, that is and always should be priority #1.This. I am working from home and nothing has really changed other than working from home. 

I am still doing the same amount of work as before.

I'm not baking sourdough bread and taking up new hobbies.

But I'm very grateful to still be working.Yes, but nobody makes you work more hours. The fact that you work from home doesn't mean you need to work over your regular hours you worked before the pandemic.Perhaps not all of those things, are you sure that's all allowed? I'll pull up my return when I get a chance but remember being very disappointed in the result, and I do not exactly have low home expenses...I don't rent, I pay $800 a week to my mortgage. Fuck me right?! 

I guess if you're renting it could be worth it.advantage for a minor tax deduction maybe.  you can claim mortgage interest if you are commissioned as well as property taxeswell im not saying dont claim it (if i used it for work i would be claiming it).  but per CRA guidance "You cannot deduct the monthly access fees for home Internet service."

Fuck the CRA if their rules dont make sense.  Let them find problem.

This article is about updating some rules re: COVID - hopefully this is something that comes up since pretty much EVERYONE who WFH used internet for employment. (though their stance may be that you would incur this cost regardless of WFH or not)I was able to take this for a while. It's not unreasonable, it's not huge but it's better than nothing.People downvoting you why? 

The ironic thing is... many rich people, born with or without a silver spoon do exactly this. They grab every advantage, tax break, etc out there they can. It’s seen as “being savvy” and somehow people are disapproving of your actions when you probably need it more and are just trying to get by / get a head a little. 

If the government offers it and you meet the requirement, take it, my man.absolutely agree with youI mean, even if my utilities went up as much as my gasoline costs went down now that I’m not driving to work (they haven’t), one is tax deductible and the other wasn’t. It’s a win for most people.

Most people would consider the gas they have to put in their car to get to work an “expense to earn income”.If you have a T2200 you can file for it despite not meeting the criteria, heck, you can file for it without a T2200. You're just filing your tax return improperly which is...fairly common with this credit.Still deductible for me provincially. QC.

Regardless I don’t take public transit and probably wouldn’t recommend it right now regardless lolYeah I definitely miss that creditYou get plenty of recognition. We are all very thankful. I would love if it you were given some emergency pay or just a flat out raise for doing whatever it is you do, I don't think a tax break is the right approach.Most money spend trying to earn income in our society is tax deductible - always has been - that’s the basis of this write off. If a part of your expenses go towards earning your income, setting up a home office, having a dedicated work space you pay rent for, etc, then you get to write that off as a work expense - because that’s what it is. 

That’s all that’s happening here. On the other hand it sounds me like you’re just looking for a hand out for no reason.thank you for confirming it's not worth the paperwork :DFor self employed you do use your mortgage interest at least.I got $120 last year and was pretty aggressive on claiming things.  It's a pittance.Not truem just has to be a condition of your employment that you work from home more than 50% of the timeNormally I wouldn’t reply to emails until I arrived at the office, but now I feel compelled to start almost as soon as I wake because there is no separation.What work are you doingMine as well. If you work in a field that includes collaboration a lot of that get's lost working from home. Plus I'm a people person anyway and having that in person banter with coworkers is something I miss.I don't answer emails after I'm done work unless it's an emergency. Honestly 95% of emails can wait until tomorrow.It absolutely is my problem, but it's also directly influenced by the environmentI’m kinda glad it’s ripped off the band-aid for me.

Before it seemed weird to invest much in my workspace that I only occasionally use at home (maybe once a week), but I also couldn’t help but wish for improvements.

Suddenly being forced to use it as my one and only work space, it’s actually worth my money to upgrade monitors, get a standing desk, upgrade my wifi, improve my office lighting, etc. I suspect a lot of others will have committed to getting their home space set up properly for WFH as well.A substantial amount of our team was temp laid off, YES those of use who are still working are doing A LOT more work.Actually, it sort of does. In my job things are taking longer than if we were in the office. My company is trying to hold product delivery schedules. In principle I suppose I could work the same hours & accomplish less. 

The reality is that everyone in my company is working harder.This kind of attitude bugs me. There are so many that are currently on lay-off that would kill for a WFH job  and are willing to put in extra work especially in hard time like this. 

And you come online and see whole bunch of people WITH jobs that allows you to work from home and is advocating to people to just put in the usually minimal effort require as if there isn’t an economy recession/hardship happening to the world right now.Two things affect it of course. Percent of space and total expensesmeh, claim a reasonable % and move on to the next item> The ironic thing is... many rich people, born with or without a silver spoon do exactly this. They grab every advantage, tax break, etc out there they can. It’s seen as “being savvy” and somehow people are disapproving of your actions when you probably need it more and are just trying to get by / get a head a little.

Exactly.I'm with you. The people downvoting me are thinking ideologically vs. rationally.

I abide by all laws, pay my taxes, and do my part for the local economy. I employ contractors all over North America. I pay them fair rates. I also make a great income that is taxed to the high heavens.

But yes, I want the tax breaks/advantages that large companies get. They use those advantages to compete - why can't I?No, it's just a joy ride until I walk in the door /s[deleted][deleted]Feel free to punch some numbers into SimpleTax next year and see, but do make sure you understand what is and isn't allowed.As someone who does taxes for multiple people, I agree 83 is not worth it, but holy shit this person is in the minority.
Last week submitted taxes for someone who got 2900 and another 1200Looks like I need to open a shell company...[deleted]Drives me nutsIt’s identifying. But I get a good bit of motivation in more social environments. Want to move cities/ be back home. Job wasn’t worth being away from my roots with covid.The environment that you have created. Not trying to argue but most roles can really be done from everywhere. What I did to help myself. Have a couple places where I can do meetings different from my core work (change of environment) even if it’s a spot/ floor in the house. I work out every morning before looking at my phone. I also schedule in a walk every day into my calendar so people won’t book meetings then. Lastly I eat well too. Hope this helps!Yup it's just so easy to say just separate the two but when there are massive layoffs happening around you and your coworkers are working extra hours too, it's hard to just do 9-5.Excellent point!! I had not considered that. Squeezing a desk into a studio apartment would mean you could subtract 100% of your housing expenses hahaThanks for not reading my comment at all and being reactionary!! I'm totally the bad guy

Those of us that work from home all year even under normal conditions get less than $100 for it... It doesn't cover jack shit.This is a very difficult and historically unprecedented time. It will invariably produce winners and people who are shafted. People are dealing with this in strange ways. There’s grifters too. Sounds like you have a job and your health. Many aren’t that lucky. I don’t know what you want.Put home into shell co name, shell co rents out office space to you in home. Claim business expenses but also pay a dividend to owner of shell co equal to the rent?I use my home workspace to make phone calls and hole remote meetings 🤷‍♂️

Interesting. I still say it's not worth the paperwork hahaMost people will meet the first condition and not be required to meet the other condition.That's part of it. Part of it is also somewhat of peer pressure. Then there's the part where I want my company to succeed. I've agreed to do a certain job & it takes more time. I feel lucky that I'm able to WFH and know compared to other's I'm very lucky.

But it rubs me the wrong way if people can't understand that those of us who are WFH aren't having picnics and making sourdough bread.[deleted]I'm too stupid with this stuff but we're definitely on to something here. Any accountants want to chime in? Lawyers??Yeh ignore me... only one of those conditions need to be met. You’re all good.I get that you're upset, but ranting to me isn't going to help anything. We need you at work. For that to be safe, YOU need as many people as possible to work from home. Would a pay increase really change your situation? What extra costs are you incurring? Life isn't fair, we all are doing what we can to quash this thing and get life back to normal as quickly as possible. I wish minimum wages, and all wages for that matter were higher. I wish taxes on low and medium earners was lower. I've always thought that, the pandemic doesn't change anything it just highlights the problems we always had.You never did explain how you're being shafted. I think you're jealous that some people's careers can be done remotely while yours cannot. That's just a reality of your career, what are we supposed to do about it?All good, thanks for the explanation, didn't have to delete your comment :)http://imgur.com/a/zKZg1Nj

Hope this helps !The fund is the primary security holder, the FUND is taxed. End unit holder is irrelevant.YesOnly US-listed funds are tax-exempt in an RRSP.

Cdn-listed funds that hold US companies offer Canadians an easy way to invest and profit off the growth of the US economy, by buying them on the TSX, in $CAD. Instead of having to convert $CAD into $USD then buying on the NYSE.

Tech is hard for me to judge what will do well.My TFSA was at Scotia as well. It's quite simple. Just set up a TFSA at Questrade. They have an online form you'll fill out to transfer your funds from Scotia and then they take care of the rest.Open an account at the new brokerage. Wait a few days (or much longer because see at the bottom) Fill out the transfer account form. Done. 

But there can be problems. Dividends may get paid to your old account during the transfer. Some mutual funds, ETFs pay dividends in the form of shares the following year. So you have to come up with a plan to deal with this. It could be timing after dividends are received or sell some things to avoid money going into the old account.Then have to deal with emptying the old account 2, 3, 4 times.Fill out a T2033I Did a similar move and they closed the tsfa for me at the request of the new institution. There was a small fee so expect that. But otherwise I just opened a new tsfa and the new place had an option to transfer it over for me.So once that transfer is complete the Scotia TFSA no longer exists? 

And the questrade TFSA functions the same as any other TFSA?You’ll still have your account- it’ll just be empty. You’ll probably want to close it after as I think they have inactivity fees. 

The Questrade TFSA is a regular tfsa and functions the same."Among G-7, only Canada and Germany still have S&P’s top rating"This is like telling a drunken sailor that he's good for more beer on ample bladder room bc he just took a piss.Wait wasn't Trudeau going to destroy both the economy and the Canadian society???? Been told that for a while from the turds in /r/canada“We expect the Canadian economy to recover in 2021, which will partially compensate for the loss of output this year, and continued GDP growth thereafter,” S&P analysts said. “This recovery will lead to an improvement in the government’s deficit in 2021.”

"The statement came after Fitch Ratings dropped the country to a “AA+” rating on Wednesday over what it called [“the deterioration of Canada’s public finances”] (https://globalnews.ca/news/7103870/coronavirus-morneau-defends-finances-canada-credit-downgraded/)Don't listen to them.  Half of them are foreign instigators trying to get the gullible bigots to believe immigration is bad.  Basically in order to keep the Canadian economy from growing.  The other half are the knee jerk emotional cripples that fall for it.What returdsImprove it over this year? Yes. Below pre covid levels? Doubtful.Do you know there’s a difference between a deficit and total debt? Because I don’t see how anyone that understands the difference could possibly think that they won’t be able to improve a $343 billion deficit that came about as the result of black swan event. Doesn’t matter how much you hate Trudeau for his ethics violations or whatever else. I’m not a fan either. But the second CERB and the wage subsidy end the deficit is improved by a massive amount. And they aren’t going to continue for another 2 years.You expect CERB to increase payments next year? I don’t think anyone is expecting the deficit to keep increasing.Improve it over this year? Yes. Below pre covid levels? Doubtful.I've always thought that Manitoba would be a good place for some nuclear power plants. Majority of population is in the south, and they have more frigid temperatures up north. They also have a few thousand isolated lakes that could be used for a water supply.I don't know why people hate this idea.

Seriously, the oil and gas sector could go balls deep on clean energy and get massive incentives from the government.

If we have to use oil, it should be our own, but that will eventually be phased out. I don't understand why people refuse to accept this.

If Jason Kenney was smart, he would make a smart ass tweet saying Elon Musk is probably too big of a bitch to give a trillion dollar investment to Canada for renewable energy.  Boom, Canada becomes the largest producer and exporter of renewable energy products.

It's almost too easy.You can read all Bloomberg articles in BNN Bloomberg without paywall: https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/canada-s-aaa-rating-confirmed-by-s-p-on-ample-fiscal-room-1.1469422True.

|-|-|-|-|>to believe immigration is bad

Depends for whom.. if you depend on earning a wage as your main source of income then it's definitely bad for you. If you're an investor or real estate owner then it's definitely great for you.Either that or they’re from Alberta.Government debt in Canada isn't really an issue, the problem is individual debt being enormous.If you think the deficit is still going to be around 343 billion by the end of the year then I have a bridge to sell you. 

"Ethics violations" he tried to funnel almost a billion dollars into a shell company. That's blatant corruption and attempted theft, not an ethics violation. 

It will take us a generation to recover from this government's reckless fiscal management.I think CERB is likely to persist going into 2021 since cases appear to be rising again, signalling the commencement of phase 2 COVID19. Lockdowns and whatever else are coming in late August or September.No I doubt CERB will be around next year. 

I just don't see how were going to fix the deficit when the PMO is funneling a billion  dollars out of Canada's bank into his real estate holding."If Jason Kenney was smart"  I found the problem right there.I don’t think people hate the idea, for one I think that’s a very good idea. Renewable is the future. The problem is this is just gonna pile the debt to a whole new level, which is the centre of this topic here.I hate the idea that in the face of a downgrade by a different credit rating agency, and during a massive recession, people want to spend more money when we never had a surplus since the last 2 recessions ended. 

2007 was the last surplus. What a joke.What I meant was... given the wartime-like deficits we're running, no agency would give us a seal of approval unless our compatriots were doing the same and worse.... And this so called faith is coming from the same institutions that said Lehman Brothers was ok before their demiseThe said ability comes from land, fresh water and a wealth of natural resources of which Canada has plenty. Hence the rating.Agreed, somewhat, regarding the ability to cover the country's obligations.  However, the *inclination* to cover the country's obligations is a political (not economic) issue.  The current government (and many around the world) appear entirely disinclined to address growing deficits and debt.It’s been great for me as a real estate investor, also for my other businesses. For my teenagers trying to find entry level jobs not so much. For my youngest siblings looking to buy a home it’s been terrible.GDP can't increase without population growth.  While delving into the deeper problems of the never ending GDP expansion model is not really a discussion I want to get into at the moment, it can't be denied that population growth is key to increased GDP in most economies.

Edit: No reply and a downvote.  Racists are so pathetic.Not going to fall for that one...Sooo, we should increase taxes??There are a few days of moderate upticks and you're predicting lockdowns in 6 weeks?The correct thing is to save during the good times for the rainy day.
And when the rainy day comes, you open your wallet.

.... Unless you're Albertan, in which case ***YOLO***Got it.  I do believe we are in a better position than some others.I mean... yeah? No question that they aren’t perfect. They’ve been wrong before, they will be again. Point me to a single human institution that is without flaws and has never made a significant mistake. We don’t take what they say as gospel, because we shouldn’t take anything as gospel. But we give them due weight because despite their flaws and mistakes they are basing their ratings on specific, specialized knowledge and decades of data that go far beyond what any one person such as you, or I, could have processed.Yeah, no. It’s considerably more complicated than that. Russia has land, fresh water, and a wealth of natural resources and their ratings are much lower than Canada’s. It’s also about stable institutions, the education of the workforce, historical reliability, and numerous other factors that make the Canadian economy a safe bet.That would be because in the midst of an ongoing crisis is a terrible time to address deficits and debts. Governments closing the purse strings during a crisis invariably deepens the crisis. The deficits of governments around the world this year obviously aren’t sustainable, but they won’t have to be. And debt is significantly more complicated than debt growth=bad. Interest rates, debt to GDP ratios, when the debts mature, etc. all need to be considered when talking about growing debt.Haha “everyone who disagrees with me is racist!”
That’s awesome. Thanks for the laughs friendCanadian taxation is already among the highest, raising taxes among high unemployment rates and weak consumer spending is a suicide mission. The only left is to keep the mint printers hot. We will see how long SP will keep their mind unchanged.Boom times? Tax Cuts for everyone!I agree with most of this but to call what ratings agencies did in 2008 a "mistake" is just flat out wrong.

They knew the products they were "rating" AAA were dog shit.Yeah because that's what this is about.  Don't try to deny it friend.  You know it's true.

BTW, maybe your teenagers are just dumb.  Or see themselves as too good for the jobs everyone else has to do.High income earners typically weathered the pandemic with no loss of employment or income. There is likely room to tax high incomes and the wealthy without damaging the broader economy.Your definition of a mistake is just flat out wrong. You’re conflating a mistake and an accident. An accident happens unintentionally. A mistake can happen with full knowledge by the person making it that what they are doing is wrong. It’s still a mistake. A mistake is something done incorrectly. The intentions of the perpetrator are irrelevant.Immigrant is a race now? Employers for entry level work are hiring adults who are available all the time over youths who have school and extra curricular activities.

It’s a little weird that you’d attempt an insult at someone’s children. Is that how you typically deal with differences of opinion?The government doesn't have a revenue problem, they have a spending problem. 

It doesn't matter what rate they tax rich people at if they're going to spend more then they collect anyways.If we go by English definitions sure.

Again simply to brush off a level of fraud that was part of one of the biggest economic collapses (at the time) as a simple "mistake" rubs me the wrong way. It was intentional. They knew what they were doing and just didn't care.

I'd argue the intentions are relevant, but perhaps were just assigning a different definition to the same word.No it's how I deal with racists.By what metric do you say that its a spending rather than an earning problem?

[Canada's tax revenue as a % of GDP](https://countryeconomy.com/taxes/tax-revenue) is not at at all high compared to the remainder of the G7:

* France: 48.2%

* Italy: 42.4%

* Germany: 41.3%

* United Kingdom: 34.9%

* Canada: 30.8%

* Japan: 30.6%

* United States: 26.0%

Increasing Canada's tax revenue to the same fraction as in the UK would amount to nearly $70 billion of additional earnings each year. That is the more than three times the 2019 deficit. The current round of COVID-19 stimulus could be paid off in roughly 5 years with the additional revenue. Increasing it to Germany's level yields over $170 billion, nearly 10 times the 2019 deficit and paying of the COVID-19 deficit in 2 years.Yes, we are assigning different definitions to the same word. I’m using the actual definition, and you’re using your own made up definition. I didn’t say it was a “simple” mistake, I said it was a mistake. Mistakes can also be colossal in scale. Hitler invading Russia was a mistake that cost millions of lives. So you’re both unilaterally assigning a trait to mistakes (intention) and limiting their scope to only being small, trivial things. If you want to redefine words to whatever you’ve made them into, fine, but I can’t really have a debate with such a person. It’s impossible to properly communicate if we can’t even agree on what words mean.Interesting. My family is Tsimshian, we are against immigration. There has been no consultation about this colonialist action. 
You appear to support immigration, including the current levels? 
Pls I’m curious, how are my family and I racist? Are you white?The governments projected deficit increases 25 billion dollars per month. That’s per month! 

Where the hell do you think we’re going to find over 25 billion dollars a month to combat this? 

May 01, 2020 the years deficit was 252.1 billion, July 7, the deficit is 343 bn, it’s not been almost a month since then so add another 15 bil minimum. 

Maybe the government spending over  $120 million telling people to wash their hands is a problem. Maybe paying 16 people to spend 3.7 million reviewing said ads will be another spending problem.

Maybe the government  literally attempting to siphon 900 million dollars into a shell company to pay his mom for speaking fees is an issue we can address? 

“Increasing Canada's tax revenue to the same fraction as in the UK would amount to nearly $70 billion a year, which is the more than double the 2019 deficit.” 

We spend 25 billion a month and even with the UK’s tax rate they would have collected 70 billion per year. 

That’s 270 billion short buddy. Again we have a spending problem.


This problem is only amplified by the hole the debt the liberals acquired before COVID. That was over 100 billion alone and they've only been here for 4 years.Not trying to redefine the words.

Perhaps it's a regional thing, but for me a mistake is typically describe an accident, where lying and committing fraud wouldn't be.

If I give someone bad advice that at the time I thought was good I'd call it a mistake.

If I lied through my teeth and gave them advice that benefited me while hurting them and I knew that would be the outcome I wouldn't call it a mistake. (even though technically by the definition it is.)

I'll concede and say I misinterpreted what you were trying to say.I don't give a fuck what you are.  Misinformed is misinformed.  What I am is of no concern.

You said your children can't find jobs because of immigration.  Would those immigrants taking their jobs be from Norway then?

Edit:  You don't have to be white to be a racist.  Mind blown yet?I don’t know buds, you made the claim that being against immigration is racist. I’m just trying to understand what you mean by that. 
So you’re white. Not native. Figures that you’d be throwing around terms like racist and making insults. 

You’re the good guy and totally not a racist amrite?This isn't about me buds.  It's about your stupid kids.  And the fact that you're not white, and still a racist.  Amazing.

And if you must know, I'm a Mammoth and I want my land back.  For my stupid kids.Comfirmed, young white guy with self loathing issues spouting off on the internet. Pump the brakes buds, you’re spare partsWrong on that one buddy.  You can have no clue as well you know?  As soon as you realize that, maybe you'll be able to move on.  Until then you'll just be spinning your wheels.Yeah ok racist. Keep fronting whiteyGood come back.Yeah agreed,  it’s retarded af calling people racist as your go to insult. Self awareness isn’t your strong point, you took the bait like a chump. That’ll do donkeyYou sure won that exchange.Who cares. Thoroughly enjoying your emotional comments and chuckling at your wokeness. Keep dancing you muppetSure you are xenophobe.Haha that’s awesome. You forgot a few buzzwords kid. Probably good you don’t blow your stack in one go. At least you’re learning. Good boyYou really have no clue do you?  I didn't think you were that stupid from the first post, but here we are.  From your ignorant initial statement, I assumed you were white.  Thanks for reminding me on the fact that there are ignorant, moronic fucks of all races, creeds and cultures.That’s better my little marionette. Dance for meWhy not grab and etf with US exposure to scratch the itch (I'm partial to XUU/VFV)?

If you really believe in a particular US stock, you could always keep your wealth simple TFSA for Canadian equity and open up a Questrade account for US options. Just be aware of the withholding tax if you're chasing dividends.YesAre you looking at Tech stocks right now?If you don't have much money then just buy ETFs that hold us stocks otherwise you will be paying too much in comissions look into Tec , qqc and vfvAs bigbag said, and ETF is likely your best bet. 
XUU is full US market and VFV is only sp500Ofcourse alwaysTEC.to is a great option. I personally hold it. Everything tax was is baked into it. If you have free ETF purchases, just keep adding to it!I have tec and like itYou will not be taxed on capital gains in a TFSA, just a 15% withholding tax of the dividends 

TEC or QQC ARE both great ETFs.Picked up some tec.to this morning, seems like a good dip to buy in right nowTec or QQCIts on sale today!Ahh thats what I was missing. Since these are growth stocks, there is no dividends. There's no tax because the IRS won't tax even if we sell for capital gain profits. Thanks !Tec.to is Canadian etf, so no withholding tax on dividends.AAPL and MSFT do pay about 1% dividend. You won't even notice the withholding tax, it gets taken out when they pay you the dividend.That's not how it works. You're still investing in mostly US companies. The tax is withheld before you receive the dividend so you don't even notice it.The ETF itself is subject to withholding tax because it’s a Canadian entity. Did you think you discovered an easy way to avoid US taxes?Yep. 15% of 1% is Basically negligiable. But i dont like to hold US stocks that pay more than 2% on mu Tfsa. Thankfully most US growth stocks dont pay much dividend.Good point. All my dividend stocks are Canadian anyway.I'm gay.This WEek WL

We'd all love it if you'd share!JE because I hate money.I love how their financials that are in the negatives are in brackets... like all of the numbers except their dilution that feeds them their operation costs. 

Chart looks primed for growth. I'll have to watch it! thanks for the partial lead.Prices wont hike. They're competing against cheap oil. Also, smart businesses will lower prices to scoop up market share while they can. China is loosing their manufacturing/production dominance with everyone being fed up with them. Ethiopia, Thailand, and Vietnam are scooping up textile/technological manufacturing from China at a blinding pace. This will be the most crucial turning point for the other international players.

All in all, with the current economic conditions in place, solar is a poor position to hold over the next 3 years.

On a side note: 
50 of .50c 1/21/2022dont they owe 9 billion?Eric Sprott (Canada's billionaire golden boy) also added some juicy ducats to [SVE (Silver One)](https://www.silverone.com/news/2020/silver-one-closes-oversubscribed-financing-of-9.5-million/) after buying in on it a few times before. It's almost as if he knew it'd happen. Get juicy deets like that and more and on the discord.I lurk on the discord but most of the people on there are self absorbed paper tradersGotta be at least a little self absorbed to smash those buttons just right XDI didn't come here to be personally attacked. If there is darkness, be the lightI didn’t mean it as a personal attack, apologies. /s ; )You're not alone - opposite scenario happened to me today. Tried to buy a TSX listed equity and received the US OTC-listed version. TD platform has been pretty shit the last few months in general, i.e. unable to transfer securities or cash between accounts.I've done this a couple times by mistake because I didn't notice that I bought it in the wrong account (my mistake). Both times I've called them up immediately and they corrected the purchase.  

It may or may not be too late for you but I'd call them anyway and see if they can make the switch for you.That's brutal, I appreciate your reply, I'm just saddened by it's content lol. Was hoping it was something I was doing wrong.

I was completely unable to partake in after hours as well, whereas with previous US stuff I had sold after hours.

I apologize for your OTC US stock, that's so frustrating, get gouged on an unnecessary exchange for currency as well as a probably more illiquid version of what you bought.

I guess I'll just hope what I bought doesn't drop like a rock at open tomorrow 🤦‍♂️

EDIT : Am dumb as TSX doesn't do Premarket and post market? F, RIPThanks for the reply! I dug into it and gave them a shout as you suggested.

So to give a bit of an elaborate response in case anyone comes across this thread in the future;

My account is a Canadian TFSA and because there was an American and Canadian Ticker for this stock it bought the US version but converted to hold it in CAD. My issue with this was obviously the TSX doesn't allow any kind of premarket/aftermarket anywhere near as rich as the NASDAQ. However, when you call them, they can Journal it for you and have it converted to the American version and create a Sell/Buy order for you with the American one, then there's some messy settling but it works and I was able to get out premarket as I hoped.

&#x200B;

Thanks again everyone!Open a usd tfsaWhy don’t you open up a USD side to the account? Just call into the trade desk and they’ll do it for you, makes it much easier

Edit- call the trade desk to open up the USD accountIt should be in the currency of whatever the stock is in. So if its in CAD the limit price will be in CAD, and the same with USD. Dont quote me on that, however. I trade with Questrade, and thats how they do it.I would go interactive brokers insteadIsnt there a ton of tax law shit that goes into this come filing season?That's how mine works and I use TDThank you!No you don’t do anything IRS related and if your fund is within your tfsa/rrsp then you don’t have anything tax related to doi believe the rules for tfsa and rrsp are different. i believe you will get taxed for a tfsaWell fuck my tits and call me shirley15% on US equities is taxed when you sell in your tsfa.You’re thinking about dividends. Dividends have withholding tax in a tfsa (30%) but they don’t have it in an rrsp. It’s withheld at the source so you still don’t have to do anything with the irsThank you, will open a usd TFSA account.  Have usd regular account for us OTC stocks not tradeable in registerd accounts.  
Appreciate the time it took all to reply as I learned a lot from the comment thread.  Look forward to becoming more involved in this communityok makes senseSo are you a reporter or a trader? What’s your position.Investor more than trader, don’t have enough capital to make the quick money per say, but the company itself has set itself up pretty well for the pandemic and subsequently post pandemic world....so you're a reporter. Also, try hitting reply.Cannabis stocks are NOT a buySorry though the Canadian sales volume (based on tax revenue) of legal weed are a tiny tiny fraction of the black market.  I don't see any immediate growth for any weed stock.So the fact that they have huge market growth potential doesn't seem promising? The month on month sales growth also seems promising. For me It was when I noticed most casual stoners I know switched to the stores recently. And it's only been what, a year and a half? This sector is in its infancy. And I don't even have a store near me in downtown Toronto.  There's so so so much more room to sell more weed. What other sector has that much untapped markets? I'd happily invest there then. What am I missing?So the issue really is 2 things.  Retail is inferior to black market, and has a reputation for being so the past year or more.  The other is the black market is pricing better quality weed (shipped) for what like half of what OCS is selling it for?  Why would you buy retail, unless you're in a rush and need a pre-rolled joint, when  you can just order online.  Canada clearly doesn't care about the missing revenue or this would stop tomorrow with strict enforcement and fines for black market goods.

Oh and a third thing just for laughs, you can grow more than you can smoke, legally, in your yard.  It's a weed at the end of the day, yes some are fussy but you can grow your own and save a ton.  Hell I know people who just sell or give away what they can't smoke.

Now please tell me how there is an untapped market for 2x priced retail w/ tax.Totally support this. I also am looking at smaller town Ontario, with older (boomers) folks. They're not going to have an ability to order and get weed delivered. They'll go into town for a booze run, and pick up some weed on the way. Look at the LCBO count in smaller towns. Huge amount for such a small population. If they slowly get into it, more than they already are, the retail shops space will grow. BM Dealers will slowly dissipate, allowing more demand for legal market. Plus all that BM stuff can get laced. People are currently lacing their stuff with fentanyl, etc. Those old boomers with retirement monry will want someone to talk to and have it regulated. They have lower risk tolerance than some teens trying to smoke out of a pop can behind their parent's garageI don't think it will be 2x priced for long.    I think the quality will increase and I think it takes more than a year or 2 to break people's black market habits.  As a grower I can near guarantee everyone won't be growing their own grade a weed to replace buying it. That shit takes time/effort that most people just aren't that interested in. Gardening isn't for everyone. Anecdotal but i used to buy from moms until I started growing at legalization. I've temporarily taken a break from growing and can't be arsed to order online when I can drop by the beer store/pot store next to each other on the way home from work.  Fair enough if you disagree but what other sector has a black market that big to potentially capture. I'd imagine there will be less new high school dealers or dealers in general deciding to start selling weed with legalization. And maybe mom's will slowly move to the legal side who knows what the future holds.I honestly don't get the hate this sector gets. It's Canada ffs near everyone smokes. And in 10 years most will smoke legallyI like this.I like this too.In there garage?*their

The chart action over the earlier part of the last three weeks or so shows a rising price with weak volume, followed by a strong price surge, again on weak volume, that was not exceeded. This has exhaustion written all over it.

The subsequent price fall over the last 5 days supports this idea.

Throw in the truth that it has climbed to valuations that cannot be justified in any way, and it is ripe for a hard retraction to a more defendable price.

Of course, the overdone enthusiasm can still get to be even more overdone. Caution is always advised.

It will be interesting to see if the stock will pull back down to the 1.30 that it is being bought at by Canaccord[deleted]Gotcha - thanks for the info.Yup :)AgreedQTradeI think they might release more news? Just going off a rumor. Order book looks like it dumped a bitIt pulled back a touch. But not nearly far enough for me to double down on my gainsNice! I also made some good returns.Do you think we are topping out at the max for the time being? I’m not sure if I see it going beyond $2 for quite a while. Thoughts?Agreed - I don’t see it going much past $2 in the next couple of weeks. But that’s just based on how it’s been behaving. In a month or two I have no idea and I don’t know enough about analyzing the financials to make an informed guess.Last week was profitable. Hopefully some others got a chance to pick up some SPAQ or MRS before they popped up. 

Im thinking about reentering GRAF and buying more WVM (westvault mining). Exited my PGM position at 2.25, probably premature hahaDude I sold PGM at like 1.21.Anything better than Questrade for a small account?i dipped my toes into MRS based off your tip. Thank you!Might consider wealthsimple for 0 commission trades. Limited stock selection though.Would be impressive if you bought in March when it was 2 cents. Now you're just gonna be bagholdingWow you're swinging around some size there[It is though](https://youtu.be/kvULLXEk-xQ?t=89)...

|-|-|-|-|getting close to FDA.....

" MedMira has ramped up its weekly production within a short period of time and has substantially increased its existing and trained workforce in order to meet the increasing demand for its product. The Company has started shipping REVEALCOVID-19™ Total Antibody Test, RVF®-based rapid serological assay that detects total antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of COVID-19, in human serum, plasma and venipuncture whole blood, to its exclusive distribution partner, WebbDX. MedMira is extremely pleased that, at the time of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, the company could bring REVEALCOVID-19™ Total Antibody Test to the market as well as create new jobs. ."

&#x200B;

"MedMira’s unique and patented Rapid Vertical Flow® platform differs from the commonly used Lateral Flow technology prompting different questions from the FDA and may result in a longer lead time."

" While awaiting the FDA authorization, however, REVEALCOVID-19™ Total Antibody Test can be distributed in the United States as per the FDA policy. "
