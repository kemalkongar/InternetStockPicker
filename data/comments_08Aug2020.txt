I bought a put after the Muddy Waters and Citron report...they were @ $37 then ....lost $400....

Be like Elsa, let it go...I joined the short side at $80, kept adding at $90 and $100, at $110 Schwab didn't have any shares to short. 

There is some investor out there dropping $1 billion at will to support this stock price.the market can stay irrational etc etcI read $GSK and was sad even though it is a small position. Thank heavens it is not them.Muddy Waters already tried to short TAL, another afterschool tutoring company before, and it didn't work out. it's been years and TAL keeps on going up

üòíHey, they will eventually have to drop right? Just keep averaging down your puts /sNone of the red flags logically point to fraud. Shady? Sure. Disreputable? Sure. Fraud? Would be tough to prove in court.Was just about to say this. I am so glad i did not short/put because i thought the momentum of online learning was on GSX's side even if it is legit fraud.Sorry bud.Likely Larry Chen, CEO and billionaire who owns 47% of shares.SoftBank is in a similar situation. Masayoshi Son just buys up the stock to burn traders whenever it goes red. Now he's starting up another fund that I suspect will be used to prop up his existing one. It could go on for years.Even the President mixes them up:

> On vaccines, last week, we announced a $2.1 billion partnership with Sanofi and GSX [GSK] to purchase and produce 100 million doses of their coronavirus vaccine.
https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-3-2020/

Sadly, for my GSK position. Could‚Äôve really used that pump.Haha sorry!Yeah this was bothering me too. I haven't been able to find any reasonable timeframe for which the fraud would be revealed. If the company is artificially skewing its numbers and you combine that with the lack of third party oversight or independent investigations this could go on indefinitely and much longer than any individual investor can expect to hold a short position.That's why I labelled them red flags. If you scroll down a bit more you'll see under the heading "fraud" all the fraudulent activities the company has engaged in.Adam put on the best Son trade.

The best you can do with utter incompetence is to directly take his money.They are awesome, great business model.  There's basically no way they can lose money.

> And they said, well, we've found out that 98% of our business was coming from 22 words. So, wait, we're buying 3,200 words and 98% of the business is coming from 22 words. What are the 22 words? And they said, well, it's the word Restoration Hardware and the 21 ways to spell it wrong, okay? 

I also wonder who actually sees these search ads anymore. I've been a religious user of adblockers for ages, and Firefox mobile has extension support, so you avoid them on mobile.Oh man, there's an even better article on this that I thought was fantastic, I'll try to find it.

Plus, atleast they bring you drinks.at least with the stock market i can at least fool myself into believing i am making educated decisionsDay trade some crypto, the market never closes and there‚Äôs no regulationsBut in casinos you lose.  On Robinhood stonks only go up.Just invest, don‚Äôt trade. You will be poor.This man YOINKED this from wsb for some karmaI dare ykh to post this on the wsb subüòÇüòÇüòÇSpeaking of...WHY IS MGM SPIKING?So far I had more luck in casino.Man I need help with the app idk anything about thisDepends on what you're buying.  I like to buy when the stocks are performing miserably and maybe they will increase in value.  Some never do, or if they do I am not holding them anymore.

Also takes a lot of research to anticipate what is going to happen.  Like I totally missed out on Kodak but you would need to have your head in the sand not to see the Microsoft/TikTok thing.  So I bought Kodak thinking it would go even higher, and it only did by 13%, and so far as Microsoft it tends to go up no matter what happens, so I purchased more, but so far the TikTok rumors only bumped it up a few percent anyway.

If Microsoft can pull a deal through the stock will go up even further.  But I have no incentive to sell Microsoft's stock, so its all relative.

So no, I have not profited from any of those 400% increases.  Right now no one really knows when the next 400% moment may happen, or to which company it may happen for.  You could play it safe and have money in every conceivable stock or you could focus your efforts on the next big thing.  

It is infuriating when you see a stock up by a factor of 4 or more and you did not buy in.  A lot of times those same stocks go back down.  That is the casino aspect of it.Me and my friend like to compare the stock market to poker.I‚Äôm not trying to sound snobbish or superior. I got in right around pandemic betting spy down then buying stuff at bottom. How do people lose so much money? If you buy solid companies I don‚Äôt see how you can get burned over and over.ROFLI‚Äôm up 35% the last 3 monthsExtremely important not to confuse an investment and a speculation. Sadly these "investors" are going to get burned sooner or laterWho are you? I am you!My through process: If I buy in $250 for some BJ or Baccarat or throw $250 on a stock, my chances of reaching $0 are much better in the casino, at least if I throw $250 on a stock I might walk away with $30. HahaI‚Äôm up 320% since April. If you‚Äôre losing money, you‚Äôre playing too fast and loose!I do quite well with options every week. Casinos have been not so muchliterally just buy arkf thoughI bought apple when it was $330 back in July and right now it‚Äôs sitting at $445. I just did a swing trade with beyond meat that netted me $1,100. 

You make money when you have knowledge and you loose money when you lack knowledge.Lol robinhood traders... you guys will wise up one day. Robinhood is the tricycle for new traders. You want to make steady money move over to a real broker made for traders (TD Ameritrade, Etrade, CME Group, Webull, Charles Schwab).

I do IT and when Dell, HPE, Lenovo, SuperMicro finally started pushing AMD servers really hard in their channel marketing I went in on AMD. Sadly I sold from $20 at $40 and not $80.

That information is all technically public because anyone can sign up for it on [dell.com](https://dell.com) for example so its not against the law, you are just unlikely to receive that marketing unless you're an IT pro or doing ear-to-the-ground stonk research.

The only time you can't trade is when its literally privileged information you'd likely be sued for sharing, for example, you are a youtuber and get to see the new iphone 2 weeks early to make your review and it fucking sucks so you dump all your Apple shares, that's super illegal.That's what we all think. .. not to far from the truthThat‚Äôs what I say to myself when I play poker tooHmmm, how did I not know of this Majic?Don't use robinhood for crypto though.Can you do even more trades than the usual 3 a day with crypto without being flagged as a day trader?Stonks please explain this crypto Chico says this.. is there a reason or are you from Cali tooI've had stock in Eldorado/CZR since it was at $19.

Thanks Casinos!I‚Äôm confused about what you are trying to say - You will be poor because of trading or investing?I thought I was lmaoNot sure, but in the long run, they will have some of the top shows when entertainment/concerts come back.

Do contact us, tell them you are planning some things out, ask about what Dell is planning for the near/mid future in servers. You'll be hearing from them for the rest of your life. You can leave a similar message with HPE, Lenovo on their servers marketing / ordering pages.

None of what they send you is going to be privileged info. IT depts at massive companies like MSFT, AMZN \*will\* get glimpses of NDA hardware that won't be shown publicly for a year, however, and trading on that is illegal.

I just paid attention to them pushing AMD servers towards the top when Intel has always been in bed with Dell (and still is, with Dell keeping AMD out of their premium laptops despite FAR better performance, heat, and power use). When a company that's famously in bed with Intel to the point that it was part of Intel's antitrust a long time ago pushes AMD, its a sign of bad things coming for Intel.Pattern trader warning? What? Tell me moreMonthaFu.. ty my friend.   I can now drunk trade lolWhat DO you recommend for Crypto? Using Coinbase Pro currently....what are the downsides to RH Crypto trading?Which is what I thought you meant. But your original post comes out the opposite.Yea, I'm lucky cause it's just savings money (1.1k) and I've already made back the 120 dollar loss I made earlier onWhat stocks did you have? And do u mind sharing why you lost your money? Aside from the obvious stocks went down in priceCan't remember if 15 or 30 seconds of price delay. Haven't used it in months.Have you used it? They have about 15 seconds of price delay plus they charge a fee for something I can't  rememberSo on Robinhood, if you buy and sell shares of a stock on the same day, they send you a warning. After like 3 ‚Äúday trades‚Äù they put certain restrictions on your account. I‚Äôll dm you a pic of what it says in the app.I could be mistaken but I don't think coinbase is any better than RH Crypto unless you transfer out of coinbase and into your own wallet. The real issue on these platforms is that you don't ever have physical ownership of what you paid for, so if shit went under it could just disappear from you entirely.I actually only started actively swing trading around March because I got PDT locked out of my Robinhood account 2 days after I turned 18, so I couldn't touch anything for 2-3 months. If I bought and held stock like TSLA or AAPL then I would've doubled or tripled my money by now because I began littterally at the bottom of the dip, but I missed out on all that and fluctuated between 10-20 percent gain for another two months before things started to pick up. I would buy mainly bluechip stocks, which seemed like safe plays but I would just cut losses way too soon. Basically buy high and sell low. Things really started going crazy when I started touching penny stocks and stocks that there like 10 bucks because they fluctuated so much. But I got the hang of it after a while and learned risk management so I don't have crazy losses that wipe out my gains every other week.Oh damn yea I haven‚Äôt used it I just got two stocks and dippedDamn that‚Äôs shitty lmaoYes yes I know what you mean. I bought a stock by mistake and sold it right away, and I got a warning. They locked up one of my 3 locks.
I thought you were talking about an app or website or algorithm that notify you when cripto would drop in price.üòÖüòÖüòÖThis penny stocks and cheap stock are a losing bid at times. Many are the Pump and dump kind as you have learned. appl is in a very unique moment right now. I bought it at a lower price and suddenly it's in the 400s.Great! Get started and always keep learning.

But definitely do not think of investing as a side hustle. Think of it as saving for your retirement or something long term like that. If you start with the wrong expectations then you will be disappointed.> from childhood about people losing alot of money in the market.

Yup. My parents were the same (Im 41).  I think most of the people around our age have parents who claimed the same.  Remember that our parents were 'coming into their own' during the 70s which was a horrible market period, and you can better understand where they are coming from.

That said, if you pick up a diversified ETF you can expect between 4% and 9% return per year on the money you invest.  Some years you'll have a -10% return, some years you'll have a +30% return, but on average, over the long haul, you'll get around 6 or 7.

> getting into this field as a side hustle

**No.  Just no.**  You aren't smart enough for this.  What you're insinuating is day trading, and you'll lose.  What you can do is park your money in regular installments in something called VGRO.  You wont change your life with the market, but you'll ensure you're not destitute when you retire (and you might be able to retire earlier than others).

Resist the desire to 'play.'  You'll see other people here saying how they made so much on a quick trade on SHOP or TSLA... ignore the FOMO (fear of missing out).  Put your money into a well diversified ETF like VGRO and just wait it out.

==How to start==

Open up a Questrade account.  You can choose Margin, TFSA or RRSP.  Margin should be the last account you use to invest as it's not tax sheltered.  RRSP or TFSA depends on just exactly how much you earn a year, but we're talking pennies on the dollar differences for most people.  RRSPs and TFSAs have maximum contribution allowances (you can find out what your contribution is from your tax return), so put all your money into them before moving on to Margin.  TFSA has one benefit over RRSP in that you can withdraw your money at any time without penalty.  You can write off your RRSP contribution, but if you withdraw the money you'll face a withholding fee and taxes.

Once your account is setup, you can easily make "bill payments" from your online bank to your questrade accounts.  Questrade has easy to follow instructions, and if you're scared, they have good customer support to help you out.  It's as easy as paying your water bill online.

Once the money is transfered into the account, you then "buy" the ETF.  Questrade has no fees for buying ETFs, but they do have a fee if you sell them.

Once you've bought the ETF, you just let it ride until you retire.  I don't know about that step yet, as I am 14 years away from my retirement date.Think of the stock market as a big casino. If you 'invest' long-term you increase your odds of winning and become the house of sorts. If you 'speculate' and look to invest short-term to make a quick buck you might get lucky but the odds are stacked against you and you risk losing your money over time. 

The market and economy is incredibly complex and you can dedicate your life to studying and reading about investing but it doesn't have to be hard, it's really pretty simple to be honest. These days you can buy one low cost ETF that will give you access to thousands of companies around the globe, super simple and you will probably outperform the vast majority of retail and professional investors."The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, the second best time is now". Welcome to the world of investing!

I'm assuming your investing knowledge is limited, so with regards to learning I'd recommend heading over to Investopedia. They have several guides for a plethora of investing topics. I read those guides when I started out and it was incredibly helpful. Also some books like "Investing for Dummies" and "Learn to Earn" by Peter Lynch are great resources.

In terms of buying investment products, I'd recommend a low-cost index fund, or some ETFs. An index fund is arguably one of the lowest maintenance investments out there. You can begin to purchase individual stocks/REITs/bonds as your investing knowledge grows. Best of luck!ETF>mutual fundsI started investing in July 2019 using Wealthsimple, opened a Standard TFSA. It's connected to my bank and money goes in it bi-weekly and it does the investing. In March when the market fell, my account was at -10%, today its at +6% i kept putting in the bi-weekly amounts and am a bit more confident in its style of investing now.

I recently started an RRSP account with WS Trade and am holding small amounts of VGRO and TEC. My goal is to stay invested for the next 20-25 yrs.

I didn't know much back then and don't know much now either but I'm learning a lot from this sub and others. Hope this helps you get started as well! Good luck!Investing can be much like a divorce... so many tears.If you can disconnect your emotions from your investment decisions. Hell yeah brother üòÇStart with a tax free savings account for the mutual funds, base the risk on timeline and what you can handle (i.e. if you are going to use it in the next 1-3 years, maybe stay more conservative, but if longer term move up in risk). 

If you are going to invest in stocks, it is great to have it in the TFSA but if you are taking on risk and you might lose, you should put it in a non-registered account so that you can use the capital losses to offset future gains. 

How people lose and end up losing money is thinking of this as a side hustle or a get rich quick scheme. You can either decide you are going to do it yourself and pick passive investments and cheaper options such as ETF's or hire someone and pay them through the MER or fee for service if you dont want to do it yourself/dont have the time (Financial Advisor, Financial Planner).If you are 40 and know absolutely nothing, I suspect you won't have the love for it that success requires.  Really hard to succeed just because you want more money.   Are you good at math?  Do you understand Financial Statements?  Can you see patterns that most people miss?

Day trading IS gambling.  Gambling also requires great skill, and you can make money at it.  But Day Trading is not investing.

All IMHO.No. Just no. Invest for your future because you want to have assets, independence & freedom.
If you want a side ‚Äòhustle‚Äô drive an Uber, write and sell erotica, start a fencing business, create an app. These are side hustles.
If you‚Äôre ‚Äòinvesting‚Äô you‚Äôre either doing it carefully & diligently for the long term or you‚Äôre gambling. Now there is nothing wrong with either option but thinking you‚Äôll generate profits of short & medium term investments to subsidize or contribute to your lifestyle is a mistake.Read Millionaire Teacher if you want to learn about Index ETF's and how much better they are than Mutual Funds (most of the time)Every bank now offers practice accounts for investing. Start there and see how it works without losing money.Order one of the many books written for beginners, like Millionaire Teacher, or The Value of Simple, for example. These books are entry level, quick reads that will teach you how to passively invest with little effort. Investing is not a get rich quick scheme, it‚Äôs about building wealth long term.[removed]Start with research like mad for about 40 hours worth then start investing. Avoid the penny stocks at first and only go etf or blue chips. Stay away from mutual funds IMO. And if you‚Äôre not okay financially to lose half of anything you invest, you‚Äôre not in a mental space to actually succeed at investing because you‚Äôll go full FOMO or panic modes.You won't know until you try. I started 3 months ago with 100$. (I know its a small amount). But Go for ItI recommend the Canadian Couch Potato website to get started, there are some model portfolios you can follow and lots of learning materials.

Set up a DIY investment account (I.e. TD Direct Investing)

Then you're all set.It's good that you're starting now. It's not too late. You're 40 so you still have a good 25 years before you retire. 

My personal advice would be to not try to be a hero and play the market. Especially in your case - you have very little margin for error. So step 1: pay off any debts you have, especially high-interest one. Step 2, make sure you have a 6-month emergency fund.

Once those are established, open a Questrade or Wealthsimple Trade account. Open a TFSA. If you've never contributed to one, you fave up to, I believe, almost $70k in contribution room.  I would recommend either the Vanguard VGRO or the Blackrock XGRO ETF funds. The benefits of these is that they are a collection of stocks and follow the market. They are passive, boring ways to invest, but also the most effective and safest for the vast majority of people. Keep buying on a weekly, monthly or whatever you want basis, resist the urge to play the market, and watch your money grow.

It's that simple.Normally I would say the side hustle idea is smart. It gives you one or a few years or practice with amounts you ar willing to lose.

However given your age and the current economic climate, listen to the majority of redditors who will tell you to just put a portion on your every paycheck in index funds.Read "Beat the Bank" by Larry BatesYou're in the right place man, I would advise Canadian couch potato. Huge advantage over your bank's investing strategies and mutual funds ect. And so very easy to get into. Just google Canadian couch potatoInvesting can be as hard and risky as you make it for yourself.

Hardness comes from realizing the complexities involved markets, participants and potential outcomes. Its like a huge game of chess in some ways. You can easily get schooled if you jump head first into a game with little to no experience.

And risk comes from your willingness to dive into predictions based on varying amounts of data. The more data you have the more you control for risk

So for beginners it is often recommended to consistently put aside money into index funds. Index funds capture a broad but favourable outcome because you are betting on all the horses available. With this strategy, over time, you will have bet on more winning horses than losers and your invested capital will have increased in value. Or so it has always gone.A book that got me started was HOW NOT TO MOVE BACK WITH YOUR PARENTS by Rob Carrick.

Gives you a nice overview about investing in Canada.Use Investopedia as a source for informative and user friendly articles (and short videos). I‚Äôd suggest researching ETFs (exchange traded funds) as well.If you're nervous open a practice account. I know RBC offers them. You get $100k of play money and can buy stocks and see how they go.I got started last year. Practical tips: 
1. Always place a limit order when investing in not too mainstream company. Paid way too much for one of my initial trades. 
2. Stay away from micro companies. Market cap less than $10M, just walk away.

At 40 I would stick to value investing. There's a sub for that.Keep it simple and don't overthink it. Buy ticker symbol VFV and hold. Keep funneling extra money there when you can.

The reason I say this is because everyone has their own agenda and/or financial goals.

My own strategy for saving is split between an index fund with Vanguard, Bitcoin, and six months of cash for emergencies if my job changes or disappears.

Good books to listen to on Audible while building your six months of savings include The Bitcoin Standard, The Simple Path to Wealth, and The Price of Tomorrow. Please take my advice and read all three. If you choose to buy some Bitcoin, you can do so efficiently by joining Coinbase Pro, wiring money, and setting a limit order. From here, send the Bitcoin to a hardware wallet like the Ledger Nano S. Avoid alt coins, even though some may appear to go up faster than Bitcoin for times. People will trade back and forth, but Bitcoin is the real winner. Good luck!Every. One. Should.

If you don't already max out your RSP, you might want to check out if your employer offers any group RSP plans. A group retirement plan often offers exactly the same funds available to others but at a lower management fee.  It is amazing how quickly such contributions add up without really noticing the difference on a paycheck.  An employer stock purchase plan if available can often offer a 15% reduction off the market rate which  is almost a guaranteed way to make money over the long term.>  I thought it was like gambling.

As to investing, be aware that it is not as simple as throwing money into something and then patiently waiting for returns. Timing and what you hold matters a great deal. Good luck.I'm also relatively new to investing and (maybe unpopular opinion,  but...) what helps me a bit to navigate this world is to follow some YouTube channels. Of course, be carefull with what they are saying and use other sources to diversify perspectives and confirm information. The YouTube channel I follow is from Griffin Milks, that has been very digestible for beginners like me. Another thing I would say is that investing is very personal, each individual has a style for doing it, so don't feel there is a specific recipe to follow... Diversifying sources and perspectives about how to invest is a good way to find the best approach that fits your personality. If you are too afraid, check Weathsimple or couch potato/robot investing. It doesn't give you the best gains ever but it is something if you don't know what to do but doesn't want to waste time while you are learning. If you get into using a TFSA account, please check a mega thread that was posted here, several Q/A that some blessed soul shared a month or two ago. Good luck!I would recommend for a newbie looking at [Wealthsimple.com](https://Wealthsimple.com).  They make it very easy to invest and understand how your investment will grow.

Just chiming in to reinforce this; I tried "playing" and am currently -20% down where as if I just stuck with vgro, i would be at +5%.

For everyone who "wins" on a play, there's countless others like me who rarely share their story. You worked hard for that money, show it some respect and stay away from individual stocks.‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt smart enough for this‚Äù. Harsh but true. Extremely true.This is the right answer for 90% of people and certainly for op.Hi, regarding starting vgro for beginner, how about some of these other ETFs such as xuu, zcn, hxt, vcn, zsp, vfv, vun. Or does it not matter too much since they all track indexes. ThanksIf the ETF goes up, why continuously pump money into the same one?I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true. Lots of people beat the market all the time. I don‚Äôt understand why etf set it and forget it portfolio are all anyone recommends on this sub. Stock picking is how you maximize your profits. Yeah it takes lots of time researching and learning, but the reward can be much greater then just sticking it into an etfThisThank youI'm holding XGRO and planning on buying TEC in a few days! What percentage of VGRO/TEC are you doing? I was thinking 90/10.I literally copied you in terms of investing strategy. Started with a TFSA with WS Invest in May 2019, RRSP with WS Trade in VEQT this May, and I am dedicating a small portion of my income to play money at Questrade & tech stocks. 

Can I just ask if you are using WS Trade for TEC? I searched for the ticker but it wasn't there so I just used Questrade.But in the end it's worth it.This is the right advice.  Theres a post higher than you suggesting to browse investopedia, a bunch of people just saying buy XGRO, blah blah blah.  If people dont understand what they are doing they wont do it right.  You cant just go buy xgro.  Youll self doubt and sell on a dip or something.  Read some proper information then make the move once you know some of the ins and outs,  THEN you just buy XGRO (lol).

I don't think that's necessarily good advice. You just have to do your DD and choose safer long term stocks instead of riskier stocks. You could easily make a case for investing in a few long term stocks with good dividend instead of ETFs. I like ETFs for industries I want to invest in but don't know enough about/are changing rapidly. But my serious money is in a few carefully selected long term stocks most of which have a stable dividend.  Even beginners can do enough research and pick a few solid long term holds to buy and then not worry about for years.I have zsp and zqq and they are great!Yes, and some people also make more money at the slots machine. You are more likely to make money over a long period of time when you use it a savings vehicle and let ETFs reward you with long-term compound interest. The reason everyone advises against stock picking, is that even most experts don't out perform the market and introduce so much risk in doing so. So then the question is; why not just invest in the market?Problem is over 90% of fund managers underperform the index over the long-term. The average investors performance is even worse than this. These are not very good odds, but yes there are some people (Warren Buffett for example) that have incredible skill and can outperform the market over time. If you think you are one of them best of luck!I'm doing 80% XGRO and 20% TECI'm going for 80/20.Yes I'm using WS Trade for TEC and its definitely on there, i have not used Questradr yet.I don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm doing. I put 90% of my investing money into XGRO and 10% into crypto each month. Don‚Äôt plan on selling XGRO for 10+ yearsOr just go to r/wallstreetbets coz it's likely you are missing outSee, not copy. Just to be clear.This is why I invest in coke and hoesThat's fair for advise for some. From my recent experience, my largest individual picks included TD, manulife, suncor all of which had dividends (and buybacks). I mistakenly considered them long term holds. However I've woken up to the fact that there's no such thing as a long term hold for individual companies.

Buy companies you WANT to hold long term; but if and when the market conditions change, be fully willing to dump them.

If you must pick your own stocks, do your own DD **and continue to do your own DD on a regular basis.**You simply cannot say your more likely to win over the long term investing in etf‚Äôs. I think you listen to strangers on the internet too much. Every decade throughout history has been different, and the returns are never the same. You might only make an average of 6 % over the next decade goin with etf‚Äôs. Tons of people get over 10% annually picking stocks. You say why not just pick stocks? Lots of people go this route but this sub for some reason advises everyone against it, and people should be weary accepting investment advice from people on the internet. You can‚Äôt compare slot machines to stock picking, that is the most ridiculous comparison I‚Äôve ever heard. If you wanna be a sheep and go with a set it and forget and get minimal returns that‚Äôs your choice, but tellin people this route makes you more money over the long term is terrible advice. Most professional investors don‚Äôt beat the market? Where do you get this information from? Show me statistics that proves this theory.10% of your portfolio is at the casino so it sorta speaks for itself.lol. The reason I got on Reddit.Coke + hoes = cocoa's>However I've woken up to the fact that there's no such thing as a long term hold for individual companies.

Why do you say that? Obviously situations can change and you need to keep an eye on it. But if some of these stocks are going bust then lots of ETFs will be in trouble too. Actively managed ETFs like Ark also need to be monitored, and industry ETFs can suffer big time too. I guess it depends what you mean by 'long term hold' but most individual stocks in this category I would say require the same amount of revision as ETFs. 

Out of curiosity, your long term hold stocks seem pretty good to me, especially TD. Are you having doubts about any of them in the long term?No such thing as long term holds for individual companies? How often do you mess around with your portfolio? That would eat up a massive amount of time to research and would end up practically being another full-time job. The goal of investing should be to make your life easier, not harder. Selecting ETFs or index funds spanning a variety of different sectors (diversified is the key) is a time-proven strategy that at the **very least** ensures you are keeping up with the market. Sounds to me like you're speaking more of being a day/swing trader which is highly risky.

Time in the market > timing the market.Whenever dealing with individual stocks, it's critical that one has an idea of what a fair value for the stock is. Once your target price is exceeded one should ask yourself if you would buy it at the current price? If not, then I would exit the position take some profit and move on. If I can hit my 1 year target price in 3 months that's a much better return than waiting a full year for it.

I completely agree with you that sector ETFs need special attention too; e.g. XEG was a terrible place to be when Russia backed away from OPEC.

Regarding TD, I'm a hypocrite and that's my last individual stock I own; but do I have a target price on it? Nope, should I? absolutely.

I ditched manulife once I realised I had no clue what a reasonable LICAT ratio should be. Nor did I have a DCF model that estimated revenue based on bond yields.

Same goes for Suncor, I skimmed various presentations and look at their break-even oil prices ($30ish WTI if I remember); however breakeven prices don't translate to an expected exit price.

Long story short, I do believe all three of those companies will survive our current health crisis; however, I have no clue if they will outperform the SP500. The more time I put into learning finance and stock picking, the quicker I realised I was in over my head.I think we're saying the same thing :)

I'm advocating for buying-and-holding a passive index like the SP500.

People once considered GE a buy-and-hold company; fortunately the SP500 sells off losing positions as their market caps shrink. Under the hood ETFs buys, holds, **and sells** for you.> one should ask yourself if you would buy it at the current price?

I agree that that is an important question to ask yourself, but if you already own it it's not the only question you should be asking right? Other things to consider are if there is a major risk of it dropping down past where you bought it at and how solid the dividend is. Although dividends should be factored into the price if you have a solid dividend but you're unsure of growth, it will still keep paying you, where as a poor performing ETF (or a stagnant one) will lose more money due to fees. I get what you're saying tho. To do individual stocks the "best/optimal" way you do need to put in more work than an ETF, but I think you can do individual stocks well and out perform ETFs with some research and even if you don't beat the SP500 all the time I think you can out perform it with a few carefully selected stocks (such as TD) that will survive recessions and keep paying a dividend.Had we looked at this list in the year 2000, the list would have been all banks and Exxon.I didn‚Äôt realize PayPal had such a large market capNvidia 20th?

They also are the ONLY GPU/TPU you can use for training and running AI algos unless you make your own from scratch (Tesla did this when they switched off of using Nvidia). Basically if you‚Äôre doing anything complex with computers you need Nvidia. If you want to do some deep research look at Tensorflow/Pytorch. They are the leading open source software for using AI, and they only work with Nvidia, not AMD, Intel, or any others. This means large companies like Amazon, Microsoft, military, etc. all use Nvidia for AI application...again unless they make something from scratch.Tesla is a brand.Tax cuts make some sense in some cases. i.e. some companies bring in jobs, intelligent workforce, and more tax revenue in the long run anyway. For example, Tesla‚Äôs new plant in Texas got a tax break for its first few years but then pays normal taxes afterward. Big win for Texas. The bailouts, however, make no sense unless its national security/military reasons.Check out the ‚ÄúDash Scores‚Äù. 

I saw it live yesterday during market hours and it was neat. 

Basically the leaderboard tracks as stocks move up and down the leaderboard. 

PENN jumped like 100 spots yesterday into the Top 1000.Yeah I'm wondering this too.Yes, also TILYes, they are actually #1 since they have 2 tickers (voting and non-voting stock)They help make stuff for AMD and Nvida (and others too). So if you believe in semiconductors and computers they are a wise choice for the foreseeable future. They also make the 5nm and 7nm chips that Intel got chewed out because Intel still can‚Äôt figure out how to make them.Check the recent WSB post about itMost of the dingle dangles I look at are only US stocksBeing a trash companyLook at how fast their market cap rose up in the past ten years. It will be below its high for quite some timeMy broker (TD) does not have this. It has percent changes, sectors, etc but does not have a scoreboard like this by market capitalization. 

This is pretty cool.Pretty funny you generalized about every stock broker, like you have a portfolio with every single stock broker accountNo.  It has ETFs and lists different classes of stock of the same company.

Edit: also companies like Tesla and foreign companies are on the list but not part of S&P.  So this is a more comprehensive list of the top 100 stocks by market cap than the S&P index is.Yes. Reliance is not listed in USA.It makes it easier to visualize valuations amongst peers IMO. 

Also started using it today to find new stocks in sectors where I want to build exposure (Gamble, Cloud)Why?haha yea. Cool list i need to learn more. Im just learning from different subs like this and r/OptionsExclusiveVisa was 12 on the list> Basically if you‚Äôre anything complex with computers you need Nvidia

Ok I respect their work on GPUs like you but this is a hyperbole. Nvidia has a very nice position in AI/ML, and if you‚Äôre doing ML you likely need Nvidia (but Google has their own custom tensor hardware as well, easily accessible from their cloud), but people forget that this is still a small subset of all computing. 

A huge amount of other popular computing applications don‚Äôt need GPUs at all, or can work with any kind of GPU. 

And even within this ML market, you‚Äôre assuming that no other player will ever compete with them. This is not true at all. Look at Google‚Äôs foothold in the whole Tensorflow market; they invented the whole thing _and_ the whole tensor processing unit which Nvidia leverages. 

I would be very wary going long on Nvidia with their current market cap. Don‚Äôt forget that a lot of the market cap was also gained in the whole cryptocoin mining craze, which strangely enough never corrected after the hype was gone.Google made the TPU, not Nvidia.  And it's proprietary.Maybe they meant that the "brands" they listed have been staples of America for decades, whereas Tesla is relatively new.Tesla is a meme+1 regarding the way it tracks movement in the leaderboard.

Humans are emotionally wired to feel twice the pain of loss compared to the happiness associated with an equivalent gain.The hardest part about trading is managing your emotions. The market requires an understanding of emotions as that drives a lot of movement. But it laso requires control over them. Once you start letting it effect your trading, you‚Äôve lost. Be logical, be strategic, and always learn from your mistakes. The biggest mistake you can make is one you make again because you chose not to learn.Strategy I use is to withdraw some of the money instead of saving it all for the max gain potential. That way you are reminded that yes this is real money you just made.Prospect TheoryThere‚Äôs a cliche saying from many athletes ‚ÄúI hate losing more than I love winning‚Äù. You‚Äôre not the only one and I‚Äôm the same way. I definitely get excited from my wins thoI found that it was more difficult to watch my portfolio drop $30k in February than it was for me to sell my 7/17 $1000c on TSLA for $4300 to watch it shoot up to $50k by expiration.I kind of love options because of what you've said here. Inter-year you can write off 100% of losses against gains so it hugely reduces the risk profile vs what most people view options as.

Also if you lose outright on a year you can write off $3k per year indefinitely towards long-term capital gains so as long as you stay within your risk profile there is very little downside. The only real downside is losing out on the capital appreciation of equities you could have held if you didn't lose X amount of money. In an up market that sucks. In a down market you might even be happy you didn't lose more on equities you're holding long term.Yes, but that's because when I win, I win in small amounts but my losses are bigger.Cut your losses short and let your winners run .. win winLearn to build a thesis, no matter how crazy.

When you spend money, does the loss also hurt?I dont feel anything up or down anymoreWelcome to addiction.The absolute worst is when you sit out a play you knew had a good chance of working, because you went in on some other play that didn‚Äôt work. ATVI over SQ this week really got me.I‚Äôve been restricted from trading after losing 85% of my portfolio. I don‚Äôt know what emotions are anymore. Just sitting here watching the market & scratching my head.If you think about it in terms of trans surfing. You are putting more importance on the loss than the win. Ergo, this will draw your energy to the losing side more times than not. I struggle with this as well.I feel the same way, sometimes it‚Äôs not about making it not hurt, it‚Äôs about making smart decisions even when it does hurtI found that it was more difficult to watch my portfolio drop $30k in February than it was for me to sell my 7/17 $1000c on TSLA for $4300 to watch it shoot up to $50k by expiration.This is the way....That's where I'm at, and I've only ever really done this since March.

Human Psychology! Very relatable.I feel high when I make money. This is very addictiveI lost $4 yesterday and it hurt more than all the gains I had.....no üß¢Its always relative to your expectations. If you beat your own expectations you will feel the excitement again. I left forex (leveraged CFDs) and went to stock investing to avoid this roller coaster of emotions.Yep. Lost more than half my account yesterday and I think it was blunted from having to put my dog down in the afternoon.Normally people tend to feel a loss 3 times more than a gain - this could be an example of it.I‚Äôm not that emotional about it either way unless I made some big mistake and then I‚Äôm real pissed. I do enjoy things going to plan though.The pain goes away after you lose all moneyYou have an addiction to loose. Happened to me when I usted to bwin.As someone below mentioned, loss aversion plays a huge role. The second is expectations. You go into a play expecting to win, and it hurts to be proven wrong and to pay for being wrong.

Here's an example - You're watching a roulette table and see the ball hit 4 reds in a row, you go in and put all your money on black. If it hits black, you're happy because it was almost expected. If it hits red, yet again, for the 5th time in a row it hurts that you were proved wrong.reddit makes u desensitized to winsWhat are ur winners and ur portfolio do u mind to share? I went from 40k to 75k last month. Then i lost that 35k and additonal 60k. I am down 80%. I have 35k left and i really need to gain the losses back. Can you please lend a hand in the winners and straged?Generally, yes, but my experience has been that, the more money I gained through investing, the less hurtful it feels to lose money on the money I gained earlier. It is totally a different story if I lost 75% of my principle investment. I also feel bad about making bad decisions or judgments even though they may turn out harmless.It‚Äôs kind of amazing actually how our minds work, because of this humans have been able to achieve exceptional feats of achievement and keep growth going. If we constantly got rewarded with the same buzz after achieving the same thing then we would have no motivation to seek and accomplish new challenges, because what we are doing is enough. Dopamine is wired to reward you from new positive behaviors because seeking new/greater challenges is what allows us grow at a much faster rate. So you feeling that way is normal, accept money itself won‚Äôt make you happy in the long run and use the money as a tool to add new challenges in your life that will bring you continuous growth and happiness.After losing so much money it feels weird when you make some money or make a good bet.before yesterday, I had made $27K last week. After yesterday I lost $7K but I made $20K in a week. That's more than I ever could have imagined and I didnt feel anything.This is basic human psychology.Don't assign real value to the numbers, it's just a number, it goes up and down but has no material value, but we try to make it go up.
I have faith in my stock picks (medium term investments), so even though I may be down quite a bit in some (down 35% and still dropping in one atm),  I know it's just part of the process and where possible it can be an opportunity to get an even better deal that you initially thought by averaging down, don't think 'if only' because nobody can pick perfect timing on every stock.Because you feel like you deserve to make money but losing it is an affront against you.Never get excited about a winner and never get upset about a loser. Remove all emotion from trading. Emotional decisions are irrational decisions and will lose you money.For me it is a rule of thumb 1 dollar lost feels as bad as 10 dollars won.Fear is a stronger emotion than greed . . .from least to most painful, the situations are:

Dont get me wrong, you probably worked hard for your money and yea it may hurt when you lose but this is the market my dude. I suggest you learn to overcome this. Everyone loses here and there and your up too. Dont play with fire if you cant take the heat. Simple as that.IMO losing $$$  hits more brain receptive neurons vs. when we gain.  I noticed that subconsciously I‚Äôll loss money just to feel that feeling of humility.  There is something about humility that I am addicted to.  For example I was up in the realms closing on $500k at the end of March.  Since March I‚Äôve lost close to $300k.  Now I‚Äôm building back up slowly.  For me I feel happiest gaining money, but I feel the psychological aspects of losing can be addictive.  Either way winning or losing I don‚Äôt get that excited anymore.  I keep telling myself to save for retirement, keep my day job and cash out regularly. 
Peace and be good my friends.This will likely not happen if you genuinely create value by working and then earning money or if you help people or make their lives better. I feel trading is not the most Sincere way to earn money due to lack of value so winning trades don‚Äôt provide much other than instant gratification.Trade biggerIt‚Äôs also typical amongst all mammals.

It‚Äôs a way to supplement my income and that‚Äôs it.Just had relatable conversation about this with a friend of mine. We were talking about how some elderly people sometimes pass shortly after their spouse does due to literal heartbreak. ü•∫

But also, what is it called when you lose so much that a win doesn‚Äôt make you feel much either... lolOn every day you trade, write down:

* ticker, quantity, strike/price, how much profit/loss from closing the trade (to measure how well you're doing day-to-day)

* what you did wrong, and what you did right (to shed light on your strengths and weaknesses, and eventually minimize your mistakes to smaller ones and what you did right to be a regular occurrence)

* any lessons you've learned that day (to remind yourself of the many ways the market can change and how you can adapt)

* your current trading strategies, and how to manage them step-by-step, depending on how the market changes (that way, you won't forget when your mind is too occupied with a trade to remember)I started a free site to do this. Tracks cost basis on shares you own, if you use them for collateral in an option you sold. It's still early on, but it's working for me.

https://options-tracker.gigalixirapp.comWhatever you do, focus on gaining experience and trading only very small positions. Develop a reliable strategy as well as the ability to react properly in various scenarios, even unexpected ones. Avoid the temptation of getting rich quick.Options trading is not investing.Yeah it‚Äôs the opposite for me lolThis could be a sign of grief, possibly in the denial phase.Puts on your reading comprehensionHis sentence didn‚Äôt even end at that 4300 number so I‚Äôve got a feeling this guy needs some sleep lolOxy, why do you love to hurt me?üò´It really should be ommtited.Youre not wrongso pure speculative luck.

The previous day I stc some options for a profit.SPY puts in April/May have jaded meFine line between gambling and entrepreneurial mindset. Both are willing to take risks, and when you‚Äôre able to get past the setbacks and continue to take smart risks, that‚Äôs a good trait.Yes, I have limit orders I cannot cancel. What the fuck RobinhoodYup can‚Äôt do anything. Guess I‚Äôm holding over the weekend. Going to sell most everything Monday and start moving money out of RH. Good thing my TD account is good to go and approved for options.Yes one of my orders hasn't sold yet, did a second sell order and it went through so I'm not sure why that's frozen

Not able to cancel it tooSame here, order status says unconfirmed and I can't cancel...  


I could've sold my call at the best position but I'm stuck right now :\\same. I guess it is RH problemSame here. In the browser version, the cancel order goes away, then comes right back. No error message or anything. 

Mobile version says this:

"We attempted to cancel your order but haven't received confirmation from the execution venue. Pllease check back later to see if the order was canceled."Mother fucker. In the same boat

Guess they won‚Äôt be able to sell my zombie MRNA put LOLSame, wtf is going on, can‚Äôt cancel my pending order!Yup. My sell order is stuck on unconfirmed for 20 minutes and it won‚Äôt let me
Cancel. Seriously fucked up.Yes, I am also have limit order that I am trying to cancel dozens of time, it is not working. The error " **"We attempted to cancel your order but haven't received confirmation from the execution venue.**"Same. Only thing keeping me on RH is the UI but I might go TDA anyway this is ridiculousyeah me too, I thought just me. I just sent support ticket.Same trying google apple and microsoft none workingMy orders for whole shares are not executing, so I don't think it's a fractional shares issue.  


I have pending market orders for vgt and gld that have not executed for a long time now.Hmm, Vanguard is not letting me place orders right now either.  Very strange.Had the same fucking issues. My issues seemed to fix right at 4 and I was able to sell but still lost money. Fuck this appJust lost $2,000 because I couldn't cancel a sell order and replace it on a TSLA put even after trying 100 times

**#FuckRobinhood** I'm done with this POS for goodMine just went through, what piece of shit, lost couple hundreds.Lucky for me they finally cancelled an option contract I had a limit order on, At 4PM exactly. Right when they won‚Äôt let you trade options anymore for the day. Goodbye fees haha more like goodbye RobinhoodAh no wonder I kept getting ‚Äúrejected‚Äù statuses on my orders todayIt's hilarious how often this happens to RHI'm seeing the same thing. Order was not filling at price, so I'm trying to cancel and change to a different price to exit.  
  
On browser, the sell order is "cancelled" then back to pending without any errors.  
  
On mobile I get error message: "We attempted to cancel your order but haven't received confirmation from the execution venue"  

I opened a case, but I doubt they'll get back to me in time before market close.Market is closed dude, gotta learn dah schedule...Same here - definitely not limited to fractional shares.

  
Edit: just went through... IDK, keep trying??I was literally just in my unused TD account looking to fund it. Do you know if TD offers fractional share trading? That's one aspect of RH that I find very convenientJust so you know, Robinhood charges a $75 fee to transfer your account to a different brokerage, but TDA will cover that fee. That may be a better option then selling and rebuyingthat's so aggravatingAnd on your cakeday no less :(It just went thru, thanks God ;)god fucking dammit that sucks. it's all well and good until it isntAfter 20 minutes, my sell order just went through instead of being canceled. Position is now worth more, but sold for the previous price that I was trying to cancel. Missed out on $50 profit, thanks RH, gg.I posted this yesterday during market hoursNo they don‚Äôt. Fidelity allows fractional though through their mobile app.I don‚Äôt think so. Could be wrong but didn‚Äôt even check for that when I signed up. I mostly trade options on RH and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm moving to TD for. Better pricing when buying and selling along with way better fill times. Plus they have TOS which is way better for option trading

Oh and they have two different platforms to use if one goes down plus customer service you can call in situations like this. RH is email only and one platform. Well worth paying .65 a contract for when times like these happen and can still get trades done.Good point. I really don‚Äôt have any long positions so probably not going to transfer anything. Just as I close out positions I‚Äôll let the money settle instead of entering new ones and move the money out.Where do you farm anal?RH is great when it works, but when you're day trading TSLA options (which has $5+ dollar movements in a minute), time is of the essence. I'm gonna recover my losses next week with the two day trades I have, and then move to WeBull.yeah, I wouldnt use RH for options trade - its really not a mature platform. mostly for the average joe to screw aroundYeah TOS is miles ahead of RH with options. I hate fees but it‚Äôs worth it for days like today though.What about a REIT ETF like XRE or ZRE?Riocan. Originally I was skeptical about it, but it's really too good a deal to pass up on.https://imgur.com/a/UxpN04k

I like where Riocan is going and put my money where my mouth isNorthwest healthcare, choice properties, BPY, dream industrial, smart centres. Are the ones I like the mostDepending on your appetite for risk... I currently like BPY and REIH&RI've bought and held/sold many of them. 

What i've learned is that not much matters beyond:

- tenant profile; 
- rate environment; and
- debt load.

Management matters but its effect is miniscule because there's not very many ways to manage REIT's.

Ones I hold today are:

- Granite; and
- Choice properties.

Ones I would like to buy but consider expensive last I checked are:

- Allied;
- CT;
- WPT Industrial; 
- Minto; and
- BSR.

Ones I see no reason to buy are:

- Artis;
- Crombie;
- Rio-Can;
- H&R;
- CAP; and
- Melcor.TNT 
held them a few years now. Great small REIT. that juicy dividend has been steady for years.I'm in on riocan, SOT, and Northwest healthcare reit.Put them in the TFSA between the high yield and bad tax efficiency it's almost not worth it otherwise IMOI‚Äôm in RIO, H&R, TNT, SmartCentres & Slate Retail. They‚Äôre all looking good long term, and plan to add more when I free up some additional capital.Northwest healtcare NWH. Owns clinics which it‚Äôs rents out in Canada, Germany, the UK, Australia and Brazil. Occupancy rate is over 90% as of March and we should get an update when earnings are released August 13th.I like Northwest Health. Only downside is that it's recovered quite a bit, so it's more fairly valued. So, less risk, but that comes with a lower dividend yield.Riocan. Check this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/i5ohlo/riocan_reiun_at_this_price_is_a_steal_and/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) might be usefulBAM/BPY/REIsrt.un with the addition of the 7 new properties the USD dividend will be better covered than at present levels.

I got a good feeling about Nexus RIET though. I trust their holdings.  They are under valued I feel.HASI and IIPR. Neither are Canadian though.

Is it because their increasing their residential development?rich guy, is this you cash account?One my faves tooHow is Rio like 160% of your portfolio?Smart guy.Good to see a fello H&R in this sea of RIOCAN‚ÄôsDidn't they just trash their dividend a couple months ago?I second this, good Q2 report/results also.This is the only REIT I've bought since the Pandemic hit. I'm not sure I'd buy more at today's prices, but it hasn't gone up enough to convince me to sell.Thanks for the post, I read an article where the CEO said that he expects in the next 7-10 years, Riocan will end up with 20,000 residential rental units. Northview has about 24,000 so basically, in the next 7-10 years, Riocan is going to develop a Northview from their existing properties. And unlike Northview or CAR.UN which has many moldy old buildings that are over 50 years old, these will be brand new units, no rent control and have a very long lifetime value.This and Slate Office (SOT) as wellI also hold Nexus. Not 100% sold on it, but waiting it outAll REITS are taxed that way, yes. That‚Äôs why you should hold in TFSA or RSPDa fuck do you guys do for living? And im here with my $400 positionGoing after the dividend at a discount?Making 8000$/month from dividend... Could be worst I guess !Impressive, and I thought my holding of 5,000 was a decent amount hahaDude. Thats like 100k a year in dividends. Wow.Man I hope you‚Äôre super rich because holding 7 figures in a REIT is terrible investingMargin is a very powerful asset to an investor's toolbox :DThat's pretty big. [How about this](https://imgur.com/Ajp9ggc).I'm leveraged a ton. I took out a 30k loan + used up a 15k LOCEngineering

I needed a steady base for monthly income so I picked this. Yes I like their mixed-used residential/anchor strategy. 

Their CEO is allegedly retiring in a year or so which has me worried thoughMargin accountMargin. Take the market value of their rei.un and divide by 1.6929 to get the net value of their total portfolio ~270k. The rest is bought on margin, so they‚Äôre using ~3x leverage. So yes, they‚Äôre very confident in riocan. ;)Yea, they cut it by half, still 6.8% at current price. It‚Äôs not a bad move though, retain some capital and pay down some debts in these uncertain times.Oh ok good ideasame i have about $450. high five.

i think of it like a gic.If you continually make a 6-figure income, save over half of it, and then invest those savings intelligently, it's simple mathematics.Just look at all the low karma users posting about riocan in the last 24 hours, I can‚Äôt be bothered to do any DD but it smell fishy to me.The stock is massively undervalued. Getting paid almost 10% to wait for it to reach fair value is a pretty nice way to pass the time.It's not a bad way to live!From an asset at 60% value of what it used to be just 6 months ago and never recovered. Also flat dividends even in good times.>I thought my holding of 5,000 was a decent amount haha

^ This is impressive, add additional savings and let the magic of compound interest do the work for youYeah it's not too bad, it beats collecting CERBFrom an asset at 60% value of what it used to be just 6 months ago and never recovered.You're right, if it was my only account that would not be good, I have 3 other accounts with additional investments.How so?I understand cutting dividends, a lot of companies did, my problem here is that they cut half of it, and I doubt yhey'll bring it back quickly when all this is over.>5 shares here. lets gooAnd?I had an account that's over 12 years old and deleted it because I watched Reddit transform from a free marketplace of ideas to a social justice hellhole. Those 12 years was my journey to get from $0 to 7-figures, and ironically enough, my best posts about mindset and wealth building were also the ones that were downvoted.

At some point, it's like throwing pearls to swine. TBH I'm tempted to delete this account as well.>The stock is massively undervalued.

Based on?>The stock is massively undervalued. Getting paid almost 10% to wait for it to reach fair value is a pretty nice way to pass the time.


Getting paid from your own pocket...

Consider the following:

A lemonade stand business is valued at $1000 to new investors with $100 of the asset as cash.  The owner decides to distribute $10 of that cash to shareholders instead of using it to expand the business. It now have $90. Is the lemonade stand still valued at $1,000 to new investors or is it $990? Hence the value of the stock tends to go down by the value of the dividend paid just immediately after.

Does it make sense to get forced withdrawals of your own cash (since you are part owner) in the business, get taxed, then reinvest that back to the business by owning slightly more of a business that now have less value (due to the cash asset going down by the amount distributed)?how long have you been buying riocan now?  do you drip or buy other stocks with the divi's?The asset is valued at 103% of my purchase price.dude, its only been a few months.Even at your portfolio level I‚Äôd look at direct real estate funds. They‚Äôre only available to accredited investors, usually through a financial advisor. You get all the benefits of a REIT but the correlation to the market is way less so your hit this year wouldn‚Äôt have been nearly as bad. And it‚Äôs better diversification for your portfolio, REITs behave too much like common stock. TD would be my recommendation since they bought greystone and have done fairly wellCould someone remind me how we went from talking about COVID numbers to Patrick Bateman over here?

Edit: Oh fuck me, my bad. I hit a link in the COVID thread and got so caught up in this chain that I didn‚Äôt realize where I am. Leaving this comment up so you can revel in my stupidity.The CEO already came out and said the company this year, worst case, will earn $1.60/share this year. That's with the worst of the pandemic baked in. But even assuming the company will earn $1.60/share per year going forward, you're buying $1.60/share of earnings for well under $16, which is a bargain. Add to that developments that are earning $0 right now like The Well, as they start coming online, that's brand new income coming in that has not been accounted for.This ignores the future earnings potential of the business. The value of the business may drop $10 the next day due to arbitrage, but a business that generates a reliable cash dividend does not decrease in value over the long term, because it replenishes that dividend through the operations of the business, and pays it out again next quarter.You‚Äôre absolutely right. People who drool over dividends don‚Äôt understand the basics. Receiving a dividend is just being forced to withdraw capital from investments (stocks)So according to this, the last time I got "paid from my own pocket", I paid myself a million dollars.Thanks, I checked them out a few years ago and wasn't too thrilled with them but will take a second look.Yeah, people like you are what drives the smart people away from Reddit.This is how a REIT works though, they are required to pay out >90% of their income to shareholdersYeah but you should see the nudes I post on my throwaway!Wrong.. they aren‚Äôt forced to payout 90%. It‚Äôs lower than thatRoastedChickenWing? Meet ChickenWingBabyBoyHello cutieBTO 100%.

It‚Äôs easy for me to say because I got in at under $5 - but I‚Äôm a huge fan of this company nonetheless.Kirkland.

They've got good access to private investors to fund their drilling program. The majority of shares are owned by an inner circle of investors, so no risk of a hostile takeover. The project is located on a past producing gold mine from the 1940s, and the mine was only shut down due to the war. I think the goal at Laurion is to prove up 10 million GEOs which makes it a prime takeover target for senior gold producers in the area. They've also got a waste rock pile from the 1940s that with current technology they can extract gold and other valuable minerals from it. Should raise proceeds in the range of $25-30 million when they get around to processing it.
I'm confident that in this bull run we'll see it as a takeover target in the $3-5 range.GDX etf. If you don't know any experts to seek out to hear what they are buying, then just buy the ETF. Getting individual stock tips from Reddit is horrible in speculative investments like miners.AR, PVG, GGDGFGYou asked about gold miners and mentioned FNV. Heads up that they are not a gold miner, they're a streamer. They're a great company, just not a miner.Buy the asset itself....ie Gold Bars/Coinssame. done very well for me, they are also praised for their environmental sustainability.I guess you could say they‚Äôre Takin‚Äô Care of Business.

Please tip your servers.I believe BTO also has no debt as of this quarter. Cash on hand > current and long term liabilities.

IMO the best companies are those that are going to be able to produce enough free cash flow to pay all debts within 2 years.

I.e of gold moves +10% mining stocks often move drastically more than +10%. Assuming the fundamentals and DD are sound, what‚Äôs the advantage of holding physical coin or bullion?KL is much smaller business, compare the market caps. KL has much more upside potential just because of its market size. Also, KL has their mines in Canada and I think Australia. I am bullish on KL for this reason as well.I think the acronym is ‚Äòshtf‚Äô. When shit hits the fan, you want to hold some gold :)Funny I was going to suggest KISS - ZJG ETF and/or XGD

The following podcast focuses on silver, but the logic is the same regarding precious metals. I learned a few things listening about the intricacies in this market and indeed physical bullion is what you want when shit gets real... Until gold hits 2300$ there would seem to be additional moves possible for juniors - but keep an eye on the overall market as miners are tied to it in part (like a .3 - .5 correlation !) whereas gold by itself isn't at all.

I like VOOYahoo finance now has real time TSX quotes (even though it says delayed quotes it‚Äôs actually live)G&M is great, but useless for charting. 


Yahoo Finance just started real time quotes for Canadian exchanges and the charts are ... okTMXmoney. You can actually look at the specific trades there as wellTD direct investing is a joke really, too bad every other Canadian broker is probably just as bad.Isn't there some legal requirement for it to have a 15min delay? Did that change recently?

I'm not sure if links are allowed here, but in the past I used a site called "level 2 stock quotes" which has TSX. It's easily found with a search.Awesome. I use Yahoo Finance as my main platform. I heard the same about the Apple Stocks app just for TSX. I think they pull their info from Yahoo Finance so that would make sense.Really? In the app it still looks delayed to me. I normally don't see any ticks come in until 9:45am each dayYahoo does CSE and TSXV real time also?Why is it a joke?I‚Äôm not sure of the legalities but If it was illegal it must have changedInvesting.com as well.. some tickers are delayed but it does have candlestick patternits live as of a few days agoI think that was the case until sometime last week. Now you can see real time prices as soon as the market opens.As of Thursday morning I was seeing data the second market opened. It's live now even tho it says it isn't.only US stock listing, not OTCHmm. Can't find any answers, but some things I read indicate that a live feed from the exchange costs more, so free services use the cheaper delayed quotes.You guys need to stop using robinhood ..Yea robinhood has this issue with spreads dont kill yourself yet.

Stock sales can be used immediately for reinvestment (within SEC guidelines). Hopped on Robin Hood to check it out and agreed stop using it, they screwed me over then took 3+ weeks to respond to my issue with essentially ‚Äúnot our problem‚Äù. E*TRADE has always responded within 24-48hrs (even with COVID) i just doubles down and opened a Roth IRA with them as well.Spreads are basically hedged options. You‚Äôll buy 2 option contracts. A single option will make you money as long as it goes either up or down spreads can make you money if it goes up or down or up and sideways or down or sideways. Basically makes it easier to make money but you‚Äôll make less money. And if one of your contracts gets exercised before the other one your account can show a negative balance like this even if your only down a couple hundred bucks. DO NOT BUT OPTIONS IF YOU DONT KNOW WHAT YOUR DOING AND DEFINITELY DONT BUY SPREADS UNLESS YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND THEM. This was a shitty explanation on what spreads are so you definitely gotta do you own research before you even consider buying oneDo you get money instantly back in ‚Äúbuying power‚Äù when you sell?

I don‚Äôt like that there‚Äôs been no insider buying lately.

I bought a lot in March/April/May, bought a lot in November 2018, bought a lot in 2015, same with January 2009, 20-04, when things are going good I‚Äôll just DCA into indexes, or build into undervalued stocks.

Don‚Äôt sell unless the company drastically changes..  main positions are

Amazon

Msft

Apple

Disney

Jpm

Cat

BAC

O

Schd

Vig 

Vigi

My Roth is filled with Amazon, msft, dis, plus a bunch of reits like O, Stag, BPYU, MPW



Right now I think schwab is severely undervalued long term and building a position. Also adding to all my REIT positions except stag. Eyeing baba and tencent if China gets a big pullback. Adding some to JPM when it was mid 90s


Key is price you pay, valuation, that ultimately determines gains.  I love tech, but I ain‚Äôt buying any of this right now, and haven‚Äôt bought any since late 2018, just enjoying my gains and piling into undervalued stocks like reits and schwab.

Be patient, the market is going to be there everyday for the rest of your life and recessions gonna happen, don‚Äôt rush your buys and don‚Äôt panic when shit hits the fan..

I‚Äôve held thru tech bubble, 2008, covid.   Buy good shit that will last thru the tough times, always drip, dividend growth beats high dividends over the long term.  Never believe the analysts, it‚Äôs educated guesses at best.  Understand the businesses and what the future holds and not what the next 6 months hold.

Don‚Äôt panic sell, don‚Äôt fomo buyI consistently beat it selling covered calls. 
Just buy stocks you wouldn't mind owning for 10-20 years and just sell covered calls every month. Amazing way to make consistent moneyWhat do you mean by dividend growth beats high dividends do you mean growth stocks are better than dividend stocks?This will sound hackneyed, because it is, but I made emotional stock purchases based on America abandoning the Paris climate accord and invested heavy in solar 3 years ago. My solar stocks are up 202% and 660% - which is dumb luck. 

And just so you have proof it's better to be lucky than good, I've beat the S&P by... and this is also embarrassing... taking motley fool recommendations and cross referencing them with analyst ratings from US News & World Report, eTrade, Yahoo Finance, Zacks, Benzinga, and The Street. These all have some form of free analysis and a lot of cross pollination, but I've created an algorithm in excel that shows me if there's a consensus. If there is, then I invest and hold for a year. I have sold some things early but that has almost always been in error. For example, I sold ZM earlier this year because I thought we'd see more competition and their market share would tail off. I made almost 100% on ZM but it's gained steadily since I sold it. 

It's not a perfect strategy. In fact, it's not even be a good strategy, but it's been an effective strategy. I fully expect a lambasting from those high powered investors who know much more than I do.I am very surprised to see so many people quoted 20+% as their annual return.  

If I consistently get a 20% annual return on my entire portfolio,  I would be a multi-millionaire by now.  A small portion of my investment funds gets high returns but the entire portfolio is around the index's rate.yes only in bull marketIf you had a portfolio of 80% SP500 and 20% Apple, Microsoft, Google. You would‚Äôve beat it every year.Last five years running. Equal distributions (25%) investments in AAPL, FB, GOOGL, and AMZN,

Has returned over 20% annually since well before 2013; hasn't stopped this year. Only started using the big four method in '15--no signs of slow-down.

Safe as safe can be; hard to go wrong with 4/6 of America's largest conglomerates.Average 30% over 3 years. Mostly got lucky on AAPL.He was just being consistent.Consistently? Or consistently?Yes, right up until I lose it all.Dont listen to fund advisors and be self directed.

I mostly focus on tech and banking.  So I've been doing well for the last 7 years of investing and day trading.

I keep multiple accounts for tax purposes and to track my strategies.

I stick to buy what you know.  So if i've never spent a penny on a company, I'm not buying the stock.  I glance at fundumentals just to make sure there's something there.  Follow their news just to see if they are making any good moves..or bad ones.  Sometimes I read up on the CEO bios, inspirational reading usually.   This is usually how I get long term investments.

Now to hedge myself and to bring a little fun to day, I day trade some of my long position in another account.  To be honest swing trading is fun, but in terms of gain not as efficient as going long.I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had a year where I didn‚Äôt beat the s&p. Simply buying the dip on dividend stocks should probably be enough to beat 7%, most of them pay 5% plus now

Buy growth and you‚Äôll do much better. In fact, one year of apple ownership is enough to wreck s&p gains for a solid decade29 percent annually the last seven years from Apple stock alone.Yes, since 2012 at least with 70% VOO, 20% QQQ, 10% BNDyou don't need the word "consistently" twiceJohn Jacob Jingleheimersmith has beat the S&P for 37 years running.Great advice from sugar. 
What I do is similar. 
I put a third of my money into stocks I like straight away knowing I'm going to hold for at least 10 years. I drip small amounts monthly into the stocks I like who's price has taken a hit lately through no fault of their own. The rest of my cash I leave waiting for a big dip/correction/crash.I have for 5 years, started investing seriously 5 years ago.  A few really good timely picks and holding for a few years goes a long way.  Right now though I bought all the meme tech stocks and I regret not being in etfs in the short term, FSLY, Crowdstrike, LVGO, SE, etc.Yes, I believe they were employed by the department of redundancy department.ARK etfs have beaten the S&P500 annually since inception.Yes but only since about 2014-2015 when I really started doing things on my own. I‚Äôm just overweight large tech stocks fintech and baba along with holding index‚Äôs. So maybe more lucky than good time will tell just trying to keep learning.So I cab read this laterYes, 27% annualized over the last 10 years and I have outperformed the S&P500 every year this century.  My portfolio is concentrated US large caps with low turnover (buy-and-hold). I never have more than 5-6 positions at any point in time. I largely ignore market conditions and DCA into whatever stock is "cheapest" at the moment relative to my portfolio model. 

The unique element is that I use a long-term revenue growth risk model I developed to determine what goes into the portfolio -- I buy mis-priced risk, not "good companies" per se. A stock that seems "expensive" by conventional metrics may be quite cheap when risk-adjusted. It has consistently gotten me into some very good long-term positions. There are thresholds in the pricing model where a stock becomes so extremely cheap that I will immediately buy it regardless of market conditions even if I don't have cash. For example, when the market hit bottom in March, I picked up a bunch of AMZN in the $1600s. 

&#x200B;

I think the key takeaway is that my portfolio is almost purely model-driven and ignores market conditions. I don't pick companies, they either clear the model criteria (which few do) or they don't, it has nothing to do with me liking them or the sector they are in. There are companies that meet the criteria but have never been included because there is always some other company that is much cheaper. My objective is solely to optimize returns for minimum effort. 

FWIW, I think this portfolio strategy should return 22-23% at the limit over the long-term. The last several years have been crazy and definitely biased the average.Didn't expect so many people having 20-30%.This is a good question to be asking, but your timing couldn‚Äôt be worse to be asking it.

We just bounced back in the last few months to some of the ATHs for a historic bull market. If ever there was a time people could feel good about their returns it‚Äôs now. Check back in 2 years and let‚Äôs see how this all pans out.

Also, you asked for success stories, you didn‚Äôt ask for all stories. I think you need to be aware that you WANT to hear that there is a way to beat index returns, you‚Äôre not asking for the full spectrum of people‚Äôs experiences. That‚Äôs a big red flag to me.Doubt itMy practice account averages 50% a year over the past 6 years. Mostly passive long term investments too that I would have made if I could open an account at the time.I've averaged roughly 100% for the past few years in my Roth acct. Since I opened up my robinhood acct, I'm up about 1000% in the last year. Lots of luck, but always learn from mistakes. My biggest gains have been via long term options. PTON/DXCM/TDOC more recently, but I've also sold covered calls with success, and lost money selling puts more recently. Been fairly good at short term stock trading off my watch list. I'm not versed in fundamentals, so I usually stick to big names, and look more at underlying trends, hence the long term options.It‚Äôs still in the Roth IRA, it‚Äôs just a cash position. So cashed out isn‚Äôt the appropriate terminology. I sold it and it‚Äôs ready to trade on Monday.I tried for years and could not do it...always got that one loser. Most of my money is in funds which I do not trade. I am in the camp of not trying to beat the indexes, but be the index. I am in FSNNX, QQQ, and FXAIX as well as several other specific funds. 

But recently have been able to get there. 

1. I have enough capital to have significant margin on my account. I buy into dividends on several stocks, and sell after the ex date, or after the increase in price...which ever is better. 
2. Options. I have made a killing in long calls on QQQ. Doubling and tripling funds in a month. This is pure gambling...at least high risk. I bought APPL calls for Sept of 2022...23K is up 50% in a few months. 
3. dam luck. I pulled out 80% of my investments on Jan 27 of this year. Once China locked down wuhan I went cash. I out about half of that into a bond fund...which dropped about 15%. I started back in mid March. Some of these purchases are up 50% as I hit the bottom on 3/24.I've averaged 18% a year over the last 5 years, although I had one year where I was -10%

Index funds are great and the average investor should stick with those. Before covid, 60% of my money was just in index funds.  But the companies I'm invested in long term are the real performers that put me over the top. The problem is I've had some bum picks too, and when it's bad, it's usually really bad.  My canopy growth investment has been -20% for years now but I refuse to sell. 

Right now I'm 95% invested in stocks. Get the fuck out of index funds during turbulent times.  

2020 I'm up 7% which is great as I was down 20% at one point. 

I'm slowly getting out of tech and moving into banks and resource stocks.Last year +30%, this year so far +200%. I don‚Äôt see why people say you can‚Äôt beat the S&P 500. Spec and high growth stocks are my portfolio.Yes, 20-30% on average gains for year to yearJust randomly buying stocks which look good on first glance. It worked for me, idk if it‚Äôs something that would work long term.About 25% each of the last 5 years. Bull market ftw.Lol just stop$PENN !!!Yes

Short term trading and leveraged etf long termCouldn‚Äôt have said it better this is perfectDo you save up money to be ready when ‚Äúshit hits the fan‚Äù? I want to do what you have described (be patient and invest heavily during the downturns) but how do I make sure I have a good amount to invest when that happens? Part of me wants to just set it aside in a savings account (or perhaps something better that actually bears interest) and wait for the right time. What have you done? Do you just invest whatever you have on hand at the moment when ever shit hits the fan?Whats your logic for Schwab long term? What do they offer that other brokerages or banks don't?In regards to Apple, I fell sleep asleep during the march dip and got in late 300‚Äôs. Still think it‚Äôs worth it to pick up more shares? "key is to buy good companies when shit hits the fan."

Whats the definition of good companies to buy during bad times? Tech growth stocks even if they are not under valued?

Trying to understand because I think I did the  mistake of buying only low debt undervalued conpanies which got impacted heavily by COVID. Like AIRBUS, SABR, RDSB, LUV, RTX and no tech growth companies etc. 

However, these still remain highly depressed in price unlike the SP500 index. Which if I had bought I would be in big profit.

What do you think should be the strategy during the next down turn?Awesome advice. Why do you invest heavier in REITs in your IRA? Is it because you dodge the higher taxes on their unqualified dividends? PDo you sell other stocks to ‚Äúbuy a a lot‚Äù every month of the downturn, or do you also keep a big cash positionI needed to see this. Great advise.Yes. What this person said and going long on fundamentally sound companies that you are interested in. If you don't believe in the company then you are more likely to sell during dips which can bite you in hindsight. 

Cover all industries and think long term. Tech is obviously very hot but blue chip companies that aren't as "rocket ship like" have dividends that add up over the long haul.

I tried day trading and am terrible at it. I invest on logic and passion for Innovation. Day trading is emotional reaction, fomo, yolo and high finance that has way more insight to the micro zeitgeist than I'll even have.Will u mentor usAgree with schwFor individual stocks that you buy, do you DCA them as well? Or just indexes?Nice! Do you have any cash or Hegde right now? How much (in %)?Most my portfolio is in tech tho and I‚Äôm already up 25% since March low... I know it‚Äôs gonna pop soon but damn tech is juicy right nowWhat this guy said. NEVER SELL. Buy the dip. Don‚Äôt let fomo make your choices.

Also, invest in companies you believe in. I always like Tesla and Disney. Bought lots of stock in March. Sitting pretty now.Thoughts on reits like AMT?Preach my brothaWhat do you think about airline stocks? I‚Äôm shorting REITS right nowwe get it you are amazingWhat about picking growth stocks and holding for 1/2 years. Rinse and repeat. If you buy 10 a few of them should be 100% gains?NETFLIX?Schwab is going to have some strong plays soon.....trust me.What?  That sounds boring af.  Bro I YOLO‚Äôd into AAPL, RTX, 9/18 calls and nearly my port.  Now I have 100 shares of GLD that I‚Äôm selling weekly covered calls on and I‚Äôm reinvesting the $200-300 weekly premiums into moar AAPL, AMD, and SLV shares.  17% annually means your trading like a retired school teacher who‚Äôs fine eating bread and oatmeal.  Crank that shit up to Riley Reed level‚Äôs and start whoring out your port for 15% weekly gains or just delete it and start working a good job at Walmart.Tell me more? I asked this question the other day and didn't get much input. 

You use a month out as a strategy? How do you handle a big run-up like Facebook did this week and your are calls ITM? Do you just roll out and gave back your premium + some extra dollars?What strike and expiration do you usually sell?What stocks would u recommend for covered callsI feel like I could get myself in trouble opening a margin account.  What are your thoughts on QYLD?What has been your biggest loss on a covered call? Still learning about the risksI like this strategy for income but wouldn‚Äôt it be better to invest all you money instead of having it sit so you could cover your call?Wouldn't you want to sell puts against companies you would buy and hold?You sell a 10% up covered call and the stock pops 15%. Whoops.I think he‚Äôs prefers companies that constantly raise their dividends every year vs. the 6/7% yield companies since those high yield companies typically don‚Äôt have as much underlying share price growth.Dividend growth means the company consistently raises the dividend payout year after year. And on the flip side, the high dividend stocks are high for a year or two, then they have a bad year and slash the dividend, then bring it back up in the future... so very high dividend stocks seem nice but are usually inconsistent. Stocks that grow dividend every year pretty much guarantee you are getting the dividend you expect.
This is for long term holding.Stocks that grow their dividends faster. 

As an example, look up JPM's dividend history, and look at T's. The important thing is yield on cost. T might currently have a much higher yield, but JPM raises their dividend by a wild amount every year, while only having a 13.4% payout ratio, which means they will be able to raise that dividend for many years to come. T only raises it's dividend by a few cents per year, and will end up outpaced by JPM'S dividend.Why would you be lambasted for making an excellent call on solar and achieving gains like that. Also your cross referencing strategy with analyst ratings is great in my opinion. 

Although analysts are essentially just guessing like the rest of us, their recommendations do hold weight, and are often somewhat of a self fulfilling prophecy. I think you are too critical of yourself/modest, your average investor probably buys based off of something they heard from a friend, something they randomly come up with because they use it often in their lives or have some personal bias toward it, or worse blindly follow some random recommendation from a stranger on the internet lol.Did someone say Motley Fool? Not embarrassing at all. I can Google ‚Äúbest stocks to buy Motley Fool‚Äù, and the amount of free information out there is plenty to make a reasonable decision. Have found some nice hidden gems using the Googly web.Can you explain more about the excel algorithm?
Congrats on a working strategyIt‚Äôs great that you‚Äôre so modest because this shit IS luck over only a couple years.  

I think you want to make sure you‚Äôre buying more recently upgraded to ‚Äúbuy‚Äù stocks. Maybe these have been doing well lately because it‚Äôs a relatively retail driven market lately. When retail investors slow down, these self fulfilling prophecies get ignored. and stocks that have had a ‚Äúbuy‚Äù rating for a while have probably received most of the retail savings they‚Äôre going to get. when they are eventually lowered to ‚Äúhold‚Äù the stock tanks. 

Real gains come from buying stocks before they get upgraded to buy. Although the time it takes to figure that out is arguably not worth it I guess.Some of us are multi millionaires. You have to yolo if you want 20%+ returns. You cant stick it in etfs or mutual funds. Buy best of breed stocks.[deleted]Not sure I would call that safe....but you have been killing it for sure.Real nice, has the recent upticks caused any hesitation in continuing? I just bought a chunk of amzn at 3000, a few weeks ago. Pretty confident in the future, but also believe if we see a crash. People will look back and say ‚Äúof course they were overvalued, tech bubble etc‚ÄùI am loving AAPL right now. I finally hit one of the tech stocks. I also bought two calls at 300 for sept of 2022. They were 12K a piece last month....up 50% already.Amen. AAPL got us all looking like geniuses.Consistently consistently.Constantly on a regular basis> I stick to buy what you know.

This is advice I often give, too.

It‚Äôs why the stock of companies like Apple consistently go up.

Companies that individuals like and patronize are generally also the stocks that they like and invest in.üôÑ lol dividend stocks I think the next 90 days will be telling.  No need to wait 2 years.So in turbulent times, index funds should be avoided because some of the companies comprising them can unexpectedly go south?What have you done?Why are people downvoting lolStopCould have said it better tooNot OP, but a couple things I do.

1. Invest regularly each month or quarter, but if there is a 5-20% dip in the market tap into emergency funds/etc to invest more earlier. For example, say you save $500/month in an IRA. If the market dips 5% one month, try to come up with $1500 to invest the next couple months worth early. If you see a 20% dip, try to invest your whole year's allocation right then.

2. Hold onto your winning stocks... until you have something better to buy. Thinking of trimming a bit of your Tesla position? Wait until you see a good stock you've been following that is undervalued.Each person is different because we all have different live expenses and income, etc..  but for the most part, I just try and add a bit each month and let it sit in cash, kinda like stockpiling.  Another trick I do is that any extra money that I get from sources outside my job, I will put in there.  So if I get a tax return, or recently got rebate on car insurance for $14, won my fantasy football league, etc..any random money I happen to get, I stick it away, and try and build up a nice pile that can be deployed later.

Also, say for instance my tech portion has really outgrown everything else currently, so I have been focusing on dividend growth. So maybe while things going good I buy 2 shares a month, and then when market pulls back, I will start buying 3, market totally crashes and I will up my buys to 5 or 6 or even higher. With nearly every broker being commission free right now, it‚Äôs very easy to just slowly build a position a few shares at a timeSpeaking for myself, I don't keep cash as dry powder. You are generally better off with that money invested. However, I have a few sources of incidental cash that I can put to work when a great opportunity comes along. In any case, it is never more than 5-10% of portfolio value. 

First, I always have significant cash in my bank account (not really an emergency fund but with similar characteristics). Second, on rare occasion I have a hedge or similar that I can liquidate for a profit when if there is a steep drop in price. Third, margin loans, which can be paid back with future income. None of these will overextend you if you are doing things sensibly.I would also like to know the answer to this. 

!remindme 1 dayWhat I just recently did to have some money for any downturn and to DCA into any new opps, I cashed out a position in my Roth IRA. I work in the financial advisor industry and have  knowledge of their long term plan,  they will continue to put franchise independent offices across the nation and really start to eat up Edward Jones market share. Vanguard and fidelity are not doing this, they only deal with bigger cities.  Schwab assets are very sticky, and once they have TD take over completed they will have another 2 trillion, plus these independent branches keep sucking away assets from Ed Jones, country financial etc.  They are extremely well run and disciplined 

10-15 years from now, there will be just vanguard, fidelity, and Schwab as those 3 will continue to absorb the smaller brokers.

Schwab right now has been battered as most of their revenue is from net interest income similar to a bank, and with interest rates low, it‚Äôs hampering revenue.  I‚Äôm looking out 10-15 years and seeing a Schwab in nearly every area just like Edward Jones with rates higher and then having 10-15 trillion assets.   I see their price now at 33/34 a share, and think it should be 44 in 2 years, and long term I think it hits 60-100. Obviously there will be bumps in the road but 15 years from now at $100+ that‚Äôs 200% gain from current prices not including dividend reinvestmentAlso would like to know the thought process behind the Schwab callIs he's talking about $SCHW? Because I see he also holds $SCHDTrust me schwab long term...If you have a long time frame and planning on holding it, then I see no problem adding to it.  I am not just because i feel there will be better entry points down the line, but I could be wrong.  But if it‚Äôs one of your core long term holdings, and with commission free trading, I don‚Äôt see the problem adding sharesBuy before the splitWait until next month. I hear apple is going down to 120.Omg stop, of course it is, this guy doesn‚Äôt know everythingYour RTX position should pay off soon.Has anything changed drastically for those companies, not including covid which will one day pass?  Where do you see those companies in 5-10 years, will they be dominant in their fields, like top 2 or 3?

I also want ‚Äúbest of breed‚Äù

Banks-  Jpm and BAC

Industrial- cat

Tech- amazon, Apple, msft, baba

Digital payments- PayPal 

Social media- Facebook 

Beverages- pepsi or Coke 

Etc


Anything else I can get exposure to by the index funds/etf.  I use VOO for S&p, Schwab small cap fund, VIG, VIGI, VUG, SCHG, VNQ, QQQ, CQQQ and GXC primarily. And then some niche ETFs like botz, gamr, srvr 

Always have a story of why you are buying an individual company, so ask yourself what is the story/why did I buy these companies. If you still like them hold, if you feel some were a mistake maybe look to sell, but I would wait until covid is over to sell anything, I feel like a lot of stuff is at the bottom and has really recovered except for tech.Yes exactly,and to be more precise, in a Roth, I can pull that cash out and it not count as income when I‚Äôm in retirement. My goal is to have my Roth be almost like a small side business where I‚Äôm the owner and it just pumps me cash while also not costing me taxes or no fear of having to liquidate some due to required minimum distributions (RMDs) like it would be in a traditional IRAI try and not sell any of my long term holds.  I will sell if I feel uncomfortable with the companies prospects in the future or if it‚Äôs a smaller less established stock.

Bought Citibank and AIG back in 2009 and rode those to nice gains, but felt uncomfortable with them around 2017ish and sold out. DDD I had like at 13, rode it to 95, didn‚Äôt sell like an idiot and eventually sold at 18 for gains but left so much money on the table for being greedy thinking it would go higher.  Same thing with Sierra wireless which I‚Äôm still bagholding.  

Take gains on more riskier stocks, keep your blue chips

Never again am I selling my main blue chips, but if I had to sell something probably be AZN, RY, BUD, EPR once covid is over with.  Like them but if I got sell something that would be it.No problemLol, I will try.  I‚Äôm not perfect but I‚Äôd be happy to answer any questionsI‚Äôve changed my style over the years as now I can do trades commission free, so I will just DCA into everything. For example I‚Äôm trying to build a position in Schwab and BAM, so I just keep buying 5 shares ever so often.  If they take a big plunge below $30, then I might start buying 10-20 shares at a time.

Commission free trading has really helped the average investor as it allows you to slowly build a position instead of buying it all at once.

And now they have ‚Äústock slices‚Äù where you can put $100 or $20 towards amazon or Apple and get fractional shares.  I really haven‚Äôt used it but it is another great way to buy the companies you want within the constraints of your budget.I don‚Äôt hedge, i don‚Äôt rebalance, I just let the market do its thing

Cash position will fluctuate from as high as 8% to less than 1%.  I make it a point to try and put money in every month even if it just sits in cash and let that build up, plus dividends from foreign companies like RY and BUD and BAM that I can‚Äôt drip, so it just goes to cash.

Right now I‚Äôm really low on cash as I spent a lot a few months ago, I think I got like 68 bucks in there, but looking to add money for next weekYes tech is great,   Especially big tech because they have ridiculous cash flow, plus they are always innovating and growing. It‚Äôs unlike any industry as tech is never going to be a ‚Äúmature‚Äù industry, it‚Äôs always going to be innovating and growing.   Just be careful about individual companies, look what has happened to intel and IBMLove it but valuation so high, but long term I think it‚Äôs great.  Been buying the ETF VNQ, SRVR to get exposure to that segment.  Definitely a great long term hold.  Haven‚Äôt established a position yet outside of ETFs but definitely will at some pointI never invest in real capital intensive industries.  Airliners and automakers, just way too much cost to produce the products.  Airliners might be a decent short term play, but after the rebound, where is the growth?  Buying airlines just isn‚Äôt my style. Not to say there couldn‚Äôt be nice gains on the rebound, just not my cup of tea.

I wouldn‚Äôt short reit indexes.  I think the equity reits are coming back, and mortgage reits have already been brutalized.  Maybe if you shorted a select few of the mall reits, but overall I think the damage to the reit sector has been priced in and I‚Äôm a buyer right nowThat is more like gambling.   Growth has been dominant for a decade now, but it‚Äôs not the historical norm. While the blue chip tech companies are a lot more stable than the ones of the 2000s tech bubble, the principals still apply.  It‚Äôs all about valuation 

Why buy and sell in 6 months?  Why not hold.  Big mistakes I have had was sell my tech blue chips..  had msft at 23 in 2009, sold at 34 because I didn‚Äôt like ballmer as ceo in 2012, yes made some profit, but wound up buying back in at 70s,80s and 90s and holding to this day.  I sold a 3rd of my paypal holdings when it hit 80, total dumbass move on my part.   Just keep and hold your blue chip techI missed the boat on them back in the day....   honestly long term I think they get their shit kicked in by the likes of Disney, Amazon, etc...


Live sports is where it‚Äôs at and Netflix can‚Äôt afford it.

Plus they had first movers advantage and had access to a bunch of content, and now those content providers are taking it away and using it on their own streaming services. And as a Netflix subscriber I can say their original content is kinda garbage outside of a some documentaries. Plus they have no other revenue streams..   amazon, hbo, Disney, peacock, etc all have so much more firepower behind them.

Just my opinion but I see in 2040 the meme of ‚Äúlike this if you remember ‚ÄúNetflix and chill‚Äù 

I try and stay away from single product companies like Netflix, GoPro, blackberry, etc

If you have Netflix, stay long, but I think the ship has sailed when it comes to finding a good entry pointLol...  my boring works for me.   But I wish i had the balls to be aggressive like that.At that point your calls are exercised. But you will have made a good return on your money. That‚Äôs something you have to be okay with. It happens from time to time. NBD. Either find another stock with the same strategy or jump back in to the one you just used.Any stock that isn‚Äôt super volatile or prone to large run upsBallzYou shouldn't need margin or a margin account to sell covered calls.Never really looked that close at it. Seems interesting thoughYou don‚Äôt need margin for covered calls.What you mean by loss? I've had stocks that exceeded the strike price I set and could have made more. But if your not happy with selling at the strike you chose, then don't choose that strike. And stocks have gone down but I only sell those I plan to hold long term anyway 
So I'm not sure what you mean by max lossThe idea is that you own 100x shares of a stock to cover the call. It's still invested and any gains those 100x shares gets will be your gains on top of the premium and hey if it gets exercised, you got a premium and sold your 100x shares at a profit.Then you cry because you made over 10% on an investment in a month and can't tell the future?Then you sell puts til you get it back.YOLO is to get a shot of 20%+ return.  There's also a chance that became a -20% :)

WSB is full of stories of people who made it big just to give it all back.Can I see a screenshot of your balance?  The reason I ask is that as the balance gets larger, the gain % gets lower mostly because it's easy to YOLO $1k in a single stock than $100k. I can also share my balance over time graph.

Starting with $1k with 10%/month,  in 6 years, you'll get $1mil.Dude it looks like you only started investing post CovidIt seems I'm consistently inconsistent.They just go up and down like a carnival ride.  If I own a bunch of solid companies I believe in , I feel more confident about it.

Maybe it's bad advice, but I don't feel the urge to sell if a stock in a company I think has solid long term prospects drops. With index funds, I don't have that confidenceI started trying to get good stocks i could afford. I learned fast that dealing with anything below 50$/share wasn‚Äôt really making me money, so i started building blue chip stocks. Now I have amazon, google, Tesla, apple, Microsoft, amd, team ‚Äî all top performers in my portfolio and my other 20 or so are more stable companies that i know are not going anywhere anytime soon like coke, Disney, sony, Nintendo, starbucks, Cisco, ‚Äî i also keep a set of SPY as a ‚Äòcontrol‚Äô and dividend paying stocks like Goldman Sachs, New York capital management, to have a dependable return on investment. i then also experiment with stocks like space, aurora cannabis, top movers found in robinhood, these tend to be more hit/miss and so i keep that at less than 5% of my equity so i can still have fun but not lose anything. I swing trade crypto and these stocks only, and mostly buy/hold for the rest of my portfolio.You stop, cuntHow do you justify using emergency funds to invest on dips, when that 5-20% drop could be the start of serious recession where you will need those funds?For your winning stocks do you DCA into them monthly as well?

|-|-|-|-|LolSo what are you doing with that money in the meantime? You cashed it out; are you just holding onto it in a savings account? (Or are you saying you cashed it out when you needed it for the downturn?)

Also, as a side, do you think it will be worth the tax penalty you‚Äôll take for the early withdrawal?Thanks for the detailed insight. I've been thinking about picking up more shares and this confirmed my thoughts!I think he‚Äôs talking about a the former (the company) and not their ETF (the latter).thanks for the great reasoningThanks for the reply !Let me help you out: 1x4 = 4x1.Omg you‚Äôre such a loser get a life[deleted]Makes sense, are there any Canadian stocks you‚Äôre eyeing on (like BAM)? My broker is only commission free for Canadian traded stocks...I personally think Disney will make a move in the next 5 years to add to their Disney+. With 100M+ subs within 1 year they got way more subs than they anticipated. I feel like they are still missing more mature content. If they can somehow merge Disney+, Hulu or something they might just fade away Netflix within 10 years. 

Position: Long on DISOk, thanks for your opinion on it.Ah blackberry I‚Äôm still bag holding lolThen you'll lose money by buying back in at a higher price than where you sold.

I dont see any strategy thats more lucrative than just buy and hold for a long period of time. All these other invented methods just help mitigate your risk and make you feel better. But in the end, you'll make the most by buying and holding. No need for exotic strategies.Okok I see. I understand that if there was a quick rise in price, it can execute your strike price. What about the opposite? If there a sharp drop in price?But if you buy in later again, you lose money, right?Oh right, I got it mixed up with cash secured putsYou cry because you limited gains by 50% and on top of that you sold shares and now have to pay taxes.Selling puts is just another limited upside strategy.

The subject of this thread is how do you consistently beat the Sp500. CBOE research shows no single option strategy is likely to beat just buying the sp500 outright over time. If you were to included taxes in the research, buying outright would perform even better. 
  

http://www.cboe.com/micro/buywrite/benchmarks-fact-sheet.pdf[deleted]You can also invest another 500 each time it drops 10%.

But overall, the idea is to save some money for market corrections.Good point. If I was worried about losing my job or my income, I wouldn't buy a dip with my emergency fund. If I was in a position where I could surprise lose my job at any moment, I would try to build a larger emergency fund.

Remember, we're just investing money we were planning to invest later that year anyway. Instead of new income going to investments it will go back toward building the emergency fund back up.

It's good to be comfortable with the worst case scenario. Worst case scenario, I lose my income, stocks drop another 20-30%, I only have 3 months of emergency fund instead of 6 and have to sell stocks eventually. I have a little less runway then I would have had. Even then, it's not the end of the world. There was a time I didn't have savings or an emergency fund. There were times when I was broke and further in debt.I sometimes add to my winning positions if it's not too high a % of my portfolio already.

Personally I do less of a DCA every month and more of a "I want to buy $10k worth of this stock". I'll usually start with a $3-5$k initial buy and then space out a couple more $2.5k buys over time. Then once I have my core position I let it ride.If I get a new chunk of money to invest, there is usually a new company on my radar or something "on sale". Sometimes there isn't and I will leave a bit (up to 25% or so of the portfolio) in cash waiting for something to "go on sale". Sometimes that doesn't happen and I just add to whatever stock I own that is the smallest position, assuming I still believe in the company.

So for example (I'm making this up), I might have $5k to invest, nothing to buy, and I have holdings in 5 stocks like:

Stock A - $10000
Stock B - $25000
Stock C - $7000
Stock D - $80000
Stock E - $13000

I'll buy more of stock C or split it up among A, C, and E a bit.

I'm not saying this is the best method. In the past long bull run I had about 10-20% in cash at any time that could have been put to use. But this is what I've been doing for 12 or so years.Oh, no tax penalty, it‚Äôs still in the IRA. If anything, I‚Äôll just allocate it to Index Funds and call it a day. It was in a targer dated fund and I want happy wirh thar.No problemüôÑBAM, and you can never go wrong with the major Canadian banks like RY.  In a retirement account I‚Äôd just buy the 4-5 main Canadian banks and keep reinvesting those fat yields.  Slow movers, but huge moats due to Canada‚Äôs banking laws, plus huge consistent dividends.I‚Äôm glad you brought up mature content..   I don‚Äôt think Disney ever goes there, but much like how in the cable era, hbo, showtime, Cinemax were the adult oriented premium channels, I can see Netflix pivoting away from trying to be everything to everyone and just focus on more adult content that Disney won‚Äôt touch.  Netflix is never going to beat Dis or T with family content or sports, so focus in on what Disney won‚Äôt do which is have titties and cussingHappens to the best of us, I‚Äôm bag holding Sierra wireless though I had many opportunities to get out with nice gains. Also bagholding some of my reits, due to covidYes, that‚Äôs correct. And I agree with you. It‚Äôs a niche strategy that works best when you have had a stock for a long time and you‚Äôre either uneasy about its future prospects or are willing to let it go and move on to another.Sharp drop is fine. You lose money on your underlying but you still make money on your premium you sold. In fact, you can buy back the premium for cheaper and lock in the profit if that happensYou can turn around and use that cash you made and sell a cash covered put. Scoop up the premium and if the price drops, buy back your shares at a lower price. 

If I want to own the underlying long term, I don't sell covered calls against my entire position.Gains is gains. ü§∑Don‚Äôt expect 10% monthly returns..But my point is you risk being unemployed without an emergency fund, forcing you to sell assets at a loss.Isn‚Äôt that ‚Äòtiming the market‚Äô?This right here is my strategy, except I increase the amount the further it drops. If the market is down 40% I am basically going all-in.Yes, I have changed my mindset as looking it as a high-interest loan for a week. Those rates are untenable anywhere else. 

If the price of the underlying goes lower, you can just write a covered call for a long time period and higher premium. 

Also if significant you can dollar cost averageInteresting, have to keep doing my research. What would you say is the number 1 risk the average person might come across when dealing with covered calls?Love the downvotes.

CBOE has a "buy write index" which is a covered call index. It buys the sp500 and sells serial atm calls. The index has ticker "BXM".

How does this covered call strategy compare to just buy and hold?

Annual returns:  
BXM = 8.7%  
SP500 = 10.4%

There's also a 30 delta covered call index under ticker BXMD.

Annual returns:  
BXMD: 10.6%  
SP500: 10.4%

Ostensibly better returns. But this ignores taxes.
 
http://www.cboe.com/micro/buywrite/benchmarks-fact-sheet.pdf[deleted]It‚Äôs all about your personal risk level. If you think you‚Äôll need to use emergency fund for an emergency, then don‚Äôt touch it to invest.No, passively buying every month with a portion of your paycheck is not timing the market.

Coming up with extra money on the spot because the market dropped 15% is smart, not timing. This might mean allocating vacation money to investments, or some other source that would not normally have been invested. 

Timing is waiting on the side lines for the drop that only comes every once and a while.Yeah, somewhat. You want most of your money invested but some left for bargains. 

Similar to a 30% bond allocation, you rebalance and add more to your stocks if they drop too much.No, because it‚Äôs based on price. If prices aren‚Äôt attractive, why buy? Hold on to cash and wait for a better opportunity.I would say not purchasing the correct stock that they are willing to hold onto no matter what happens


Listen to option alpha podcast...helped me a ton

Also look on his website...easy to use strategy guide for beginners. You don't have to pay for anything. I never have and it has been an amazing toolNahI think there's also a difference to a "true emergency fund" too cover the mortgage if job loss occurs, emergency fund money for something like unexpected car repair, and also "rainy day money". Would bother my risk profile to do into the later two a little bit to take advantage of a buying opportunity like March '20...I don't think you know what an emergency fund is. You pretend it doesn't exist...until an emergency.

By your logic, why not go ahead and take out a low interest loan to invest tooNo, you misunderstand. I fully do. Read up. If one chooses to spend part of it for a non-emergency, then it‚Äôs hedging a bet that one won‚Äôt need it for an emergency. How risky is that? Depends on each of our situations. Ymmv. Don‚Äôt recommend doing it. Our fund has saved my ass a few times.I would highly recommend it if you‚Äôre willing to risk using margin. 

I started when I had about 3k, and it‚Äôs been great so far. Being able to capitalize on certain opportunities you otherwise wouldn‚Äôt be able to is great. It all depends on your tolerance for risk.Yes.

Use your margin to buy 100 shares of something stable and sell weekly covered calls on it.I use gold because it shows my collateral when I trade option spreads. Other than that it‚Äôs useless to meI didn't think of that.


.... what... have.... you awoken in me.call questradeYou are not allowed to use margin in a TFSA so the currency exchange request is automatically triggered in a Questrade TFSA if you do not have enough USD to make the purchase. It will show the request on the "Accounts -> Requests -> Exchange Funds" page.

The problem is the CAD/USD exchange rate can fluctuate before the currency exchange occurs and it sounds like you may end up in the red. If so you will need to sell a share or 2 to cover the negative amount since you don't want to contribute over the TFSA limit. Going forward always give yourself a margin of safety when buying in USD or convert before buying.Questrade will convert the needed funds from your account when it all settles.Uh no cos u bought the etfs using borrowed usd the borrowed amount has been accumulating interest. I did that before too. But just to check give them a call and see if there‚Äôs anything u can do to get out of this. Next time use norberts gambit to convert your money to usd first.My best guess is that they closed it because of the risk that QQQ would close in-between 269 and 270, which would make your long call worthless and you'd be assigned on the short call. If they let that happen, you'd end up with -100 shares, and RH doesn't allow short stock positions.

As for why it got filled at such a low price, market orders sometimes do that, which is why many avoid themRH close debit spreads and they have a calculation as to why they do that. Also if you got it for $74, your max win is $26It got filled when QQQ was at $274 so it was so ITM when I purchased it. Yeah cost about $74 thenDon't panic, you are fine.

Your short 375C was assigned (it happens), so you SOLD STOCK SHORT for $375K. You have $375K in your account but your short position triggered the margin call.

Your long 380C is protecting you at all times. It doesn't matter that the stock dropped or went higher today. You can ALWAYS buy back the shares that you are short for $380K. You do this by exercising your long 380C which will make you buy-to-cover your short stock position at $380K.

Your total loss would be:

credit of $3K upfront

sell stock at $375K

buy stock at $380K

\------------------------

Total loss = $2K

You're fine. These things happen sometimes.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

EDIT: 

As many have commented, since OP was short stock (because of assignment) prior to the ex-dividend date he is liable for that dividend on the 1000 shares sold short. This equals $820 which is in addition to the original max loss of 2K.

However, if OP does NOT exercise the 380C he is long but rather SELLS the call in the market (the 380C has currently around $0.82 in extrinsic value) and uses that (around 65K) along with the proceeds from the short sale (375K) and the original credit (3K) to buy to cover his short stock position he would recover an amount (in the form of extrinsic on his long call) that's very close to the dividend he will pay out. Let's see how Questrade handles this transaction and maybe OP will only lose the max loss in the original trade.I agree that your long call will cover your short position, but if you were short the stock on ex-div date then my understanding is that you may need to pay the dividend.The problem is you now owe the dividend of $820 (1,000 shares x .82) so you need to add that to your max loss.No offense, and I‚Äôm sure this will be downvoted in this sub, but this is a prime example of why people shouldn‚Äôt sell spreads without knowing how the entire process works.The wisdom I earned from several blown out call credit spreads is you usually want to close before the short leg is ITM, and definitely before the long leg is also ITM.

Don't hang out watching the stock go up, take your loss and live to trade another day!You're ok here, but going forward **never rely on your broker for anything**. Their job is not to protect your profit, it is to protect themselves.What ever you do, DON'T KILL YOURSELFDon‚Äôt worry since it was a spread, you did everything correctly, it just takes a little bit of time for both positions to correct themselvesLet me know how they handle this for you and what you end up losing (should be 2820).  Have been thinking of using quest-trade so id like to know how the customer support is lolFuck QuestradeMan. This happened to me one time. I got assigned like 40k of AAPL stock at around 176. I thought about just holding the stock.... bc I knew long term it was smart...

...but I am not a smart man. Took my max loss and sucked it up.

Coulda doubled my money but again. I am not a smart man.

Cheers, pal!!I've been there my man, sorry you've had a shitty morning. Like others have said you're fine, it's still a defined risk trade. The only additional cost you're opening yourself up to is whatever interest your broker charges to borrow 380k for a while today. Plus the dividend.. bit shit of your broker not to warn you it's going exdiv while you have a position open.

Deep breaths, you will laugh about this next week.If it makes you feel better, there was a post back when Tesla was like 500 a share where a guy sold naked calls right before they exploded.There was a very detailed video on assignment risk with credit spreads that detailed what happened to that poor college student. It‚Äôs the broker communication that is the real problem. The answer is to pick up the phone and call your broker. RH has no phone access. Here is the link. It should really help you understand how assignment works as it uses a real example with MSFT stock.  [Assignment risk on credit spreads. what happened to our friend. ](https://youtu.be/L8LvCWzyePQ)Dude don't panic I'm sure you'll fix itThe broker will sort you out. You'll get fucked but not as fucked.I think IB prevents assignment btwThere was a guy who got margin called for the exact same scenario.
Broker liquidated his other positions at a loss instead of exercising the other leg.Oh I just learned about this from these posts! Super helpful. Also, you're good.

https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hdft5z/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_1_of_4/why would you sell a such a deep in the money bear call spread or why not just take the loss and move on?!How much experience do you have trading options?I am a newbie so correct me if I'm wrong but wouldn't it be a better strategy to Sell $380c and Buy $375c?You're fine, you're out a few grand, that is it. This is known maximum loss up front.Since the shit already hit the fan, you could try to minimise your loss. In your case, try to keep the long calls for another week or two. If the market goes down, you will recover the loss from the short shares and the calls will still have some value. It's highly unlikely that APPLE stock would slide to 380, but a correction wil occur and you will have the chance to watch the depreciation of the calls and profit from short sales stock.Good luck.
Edit: I didnt notice that you have already requested to convert the long position. Next time you could try my advice.Wait if you sell your call position, dont you end up with a profit? I‚Äôm new as well but not quite grasping. Why can‚Äôt you sell your calls?  You‚Äôll pocket (Spot price - 380)x100xnumber of calls for your calls. You have 375k credit in your account - doesn‚Äôt Questrade automatically take that away from you? I‚Äôm a lil confusedChrist, this solidified my fear of options and not to touch itAs someone learning options how do you avoid this? Selling the contract well before the exp date?As I mentioned in another comment, you gave up $820 by failing to exercise the ITM call. You're short stock, so you have to pay out the dividend. You're long calls against that short stock, so you have no net delta, but your calls don't receive the dividend.Can someone ELI5 this?I‚Äôm from Canada as well, have you tried interactive brokers for trading options? I switched to IB from questrade. Didn‚Äôt like how questrade handled options trading and having certain limitations/ fees.[deleted]I would have sold the 380c early morning then covered the short end of day for profitIt‚Äôs not about seeing the future as soon as I sold the calls I would have a stop to cover at a pre determined price risking an amount I‚Äôm comfortable losing. But I get itHow much equity do you have in your account? What is the minimum account equity required for trading spreads at your broker? This could be a minimum equity issue. You need to call your broker yesterday to get this sorted out.So I‚Äôm a noob and I don‚Äôt understand something about options if you guys could help? Simple question. Why shouldn‚Äôt I just buy the cheap option for 30 cents instead of paying the $1 if I believe the stock is going to go up, let‚Äôs say from $3 to $5. Wouldn‚Äôt I make more money with the cheaper priceIt sounds like you don‚Äôt know what you are doingIt is the other guy‚Äôs fault. Who the ???? exercise the call anyways[deleted]I would take the $12k loss and move on. From today forward go only long - we have the elections coming and the trade talks and angry Chinese. Go only long - straddles and strangles.Questrade is run by pedophiles I heardHonestly, go long and go strong. Get a 2nd mtgTake away his lvl 2Bro you don‚Äôt understand spreads do you?Dude why are you trading spreads if you don't know how spreads work??Sounds like you shouldn't be selling naked calls.Prayso you're a idiot?

wtf you means 2000$?...

AAPL 380 calls for august 21, 2020, are worth atleast $65.80 a piece at the moment,

if you have 10 contracts that's around  $65,800 dollar, that you can sell at the moment...And this is how someone killed himself thinking he was massively in debt when he wasn'tJust want to say thank you for this detailed note. Helped me calm some nerves from earlier and see the situation more clearly. Looking like I owe the dividend plus the difference from the spread, so probably out around $3,000. Could be worse.Listen to dad \^Funny how many people couldn't figure this out in the other comments. Wtf are these people doing trading optionsGood explanation. On pointYou have got an absolutely kick ass options channel.You are an angel sir, very fine way of helping! also the way you explained it !Thanks for walking through this with OP - not understanding stuff like this is how bad things happen to people.You are OP's Angel in disguise.You are missing one crucial element: since OP is short 1000 AAPL shares on the day of ex dividend, they will be required to pay that dividend to the parties the broker borrowed the shares from. AAPL dividend is $0.81 per share multiplied by 1000 that's another $810 that OP will lose.I think I‚Äôm having issues grasping how the short leg being exercised works. 

I don‚Äôt own any shares of AAPL, so wouldn‚Äôt I have to buy on the open market to sell them back to the call purchaser at $375?What would happen if you don't have the money to exercise the long position (to cover the short position)?I wish the the guy that had taken his life for something not worth came across you to explain this. Thanks, you‚Äôre awesome!> Your long 380C is protecting you at all times.

*until expiration.Correct me if I am wrong, but shouldn't he buy the shares at market and sell the options, all in one trade?  As opposed to exercising the options.

This would allow him to retain the extrinsic value of his calls.  That may be enough to cover the dividend.

u/PeanutButter91What I'm wondering is how they sold calls without owning 1000 shares of AAPL, unless their broker is letting them do that without owning the underlying. Can you open a spread as long as you have the contracts to hedge the short?Would the total loss be $20k cause $2k loss per spread x 10 = $20k ?I'm relatively new to the jargon. Can someone explain stock shorts and longs please? (for dummies)Is there no scenario with Debit spreads / Credit spreads that end up with one part being ITM and getting exercised but one leg being OTM and not being able to be exercised because its OTM where you get screwed? Having trouble wrapping my head around this.Well explained. Sometimes this is life or death. Thanksrelevant username. Good man. :) I hope you have a great day.Your profile rulesMvp reply right here.Is that the case always with spreads? For example if I hold a debit spread of 400/450 for AAPL and the stock goes to 455. As long as I hold to expiration I should make (455 - 400 - initial debit).
If I believe the stock will stay above the higher strike, there is no reason to exercise until just before expiration to maximize theta decay and get the max value from it, right?Wrong. You‚Äôre forgetting about the dividend charge for being short over the record date. 82 cents per share on the number of short shares.So his broker issued a false margin call?>Total loss = $2K

This is not true. He gave up the dividend because he did not exercise the 380 call. That dividend is $0.82 on 1000 shares, or $820.

Total loss = $2820

&#x200B;

EDIT: Your edit is not true, u/options_in_plain_eng...

>However, if OP does NOT exercise the 380C he is long but rather SELLS the call in the market (the 380C has currently around $0.82 in extrinsic value)

That money flew the coop when OP neglected to early exercise. It's not coming back. His option was priced using a forward calculated with the dividend in mind. If he had early exercised the 380c, he would have gotten $820 in dividend income, and that would have netted out with his short dividend.

Once the ex-dividend date has come and gone, any similarity between the 380c's extrinsic value and the amount of the dividend is just a coincidence. The fact that the short call was early exercised is a pretty strong signal that the time value was less than the dividend amount.

I see what you're saying -- his 380c could still collect some time value if he unwinds his  whole position as a buy-write strategy rather than exercising the 380c to unwind -- but it has nothing to do with the dividend and in general will not cover the short dividend loss unless the stock happens to fall out of bed after the stock goes ex, giving a bid to skew.

I don't encourage OP to leg his way out of a million dollars of gross delta. He should either do a closing buy-write with a limit order, or just exercise the 380c (it appears he did the latter).üëè You @options_in_plain_eng deserve more upvotes! Thank You for getting to the point and helping someone under stress understand there options. (No pun intended)His loss would also include the dividends he has to pay.Plus the dividend should be included in the loss.I just want to clarify for my own understanding. The shares he calls in would then be given to the broker to close out the short stock position right? They wouldn't actually be sold right? Wouldn't that defeat the purpose of he spread, then you'd be vulnerable to the market moves. 

> Questrade rep convinced me to exercise my long position and sell the shares upon receipt.I'm new to options trading and I'm not quite sure what I read.Does spreads get exercised?  I still didn‚Äôt understand why he got margin call on a spread ? May be im missing something here.Where‚Äôd you go to learn his info? I‚Äôm trying to study options trading to get a deeper understanding of the many variables and protective steps one could takeThanks so much for the explanation. OP is ok as long as AAPL is over 380. What happens if AAPL were to drop below 380. He‚Äôd have a lot of problems right? Or would it be the brokers fault for not closing his other calls at the same time? ThanksCan I ask a newbie question? If the bought call is otm or atm, how can I exercise it as protection? I am still learning but my understanding so far is you can only exercise when it is itm. ü§îI still don‚Äôt get it. Can someone dumb this down further please.Very good point ! 

Yes, the dividend will come out of OP's account because he was short the stock prior to the ex-div date.True. He borrowed the shares over ex div date. So he is required to pay the dividend to the lendor. Dividend was 0.82 he borrowed 1000 shares. So thats $820.

OP, your total loss is $2820.

Please read about the risks and troubles of shorting a stock next time. Shorting a call is effextively the same thing, if it goes in the money. There are severe risks, that most new traders don't even know about when trading credit spreads. It is not as safe, as some of us think.Kinda weird the broker short the stock rather than just buy the stock and leave you with negative balance or better yet automatically exercise the long call.

I've never been assigned a call only a put. Is this normal procedure?I don‚Äôt think you should be downvoted, this is super true. The other kid killed himself for this exact same scenario when he didn‚Äôt understand how it works. Many people point the blame at RH, but you really should understand how it works and risk before entering in these trades.This is why real firms are more picky with who they give higher level options approval to. My firm won‚Äôt give spread approval unless you have a liquid net worth above $100k, and it‚Äôs a bank, so we have a reasonable suspicion as to whether someone is lying on their applicationWhat sucks is I could‚Äôve sold the spread for an extra $500 profit on top of the $3k a few days before earnings. But I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aware, Apple reported ‚Äòsomewhat decent‚Äô earnings lol. So the position blew up.Especially fucking QuestradeCustomer support has been pretty good every time I‚Äôve had to call in so far. Coming from td, it‚Äôs night and day. 

Will try to remember to respond to this once the numbers get sorted w/ questrade. I‚Äôm hoping 2820 or so. Plus assignment fee which they said is $25I use questrade for my longer term dividend investing, but didn‚Äôt like trading options with them. I use interactive brokers for options and really like them.FWasn‚Äôt so deep itm when I sold it. AAPL was trading between 370-380 at the time. I thought it was way overbought and didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd blow away earnings the way they did. Boy was I wrong.About 5 years. Never been assigned on a short leg though. Wasn‚Äôt expecting it 2 weeks out from exp.If you‚Äôre bullish, yes. I was bearish, and still am very bearish. Hence why I was panicking that I‚Äôd have to hold a 380k long position on a very inflated stock. Just my opinion.My buddy highly recommended it. Might move my rsp there from td.IB is a pretty solid broker. The user interface takes a little bit getting used to tho.The loss is at 12k and countingIf only we could all see the future ‚òπÔ∏è. Too large of a position to take that risk, plus questrade would have cleared my margin by 1pm however they saw fit.Several possible reasons:

1. You expect the vol will contract so if you buy the cheapest option possible your delta win might not offset your vega loss

2. You earn more money per unit in the direction you are betting if it's deeper in the money.OTM calls have no intrinsic value protection and therefore are very susceptible to both Vega and theta. Theta is a higher percentage of the premium, and it loses more to theta the closer you get to expiration. 

There's a balance there depending on your risk tolerance and desires, but you lose and gain more and more quickly with the far OTM. Also, never ever never buy far OTM short dates around earnings and other volatile events unless you really know what you are doing (you don't, no one does). And pay attention to your break even price, that lets you know how "expensive" an option is.You‚Äôre betting it‚Äôll move that much more in X amount of time. OTMs are cheap for a reason. Noob traps. Faggot‚Äôs delightYours is a useless commentnot wsbI wasn‚Äôt. Did you not read the post?Stfu and read the post again assholeAre you suggesting that he should sell calls when he is margin called?

And he is most definitely only on the hook for 2k + Dividends (around $820 based on other's comments).  Maybe I'm missing something, but you seem to be very confidently wrong.Jfc please don‚Äôt sell the calls. Call the broker and don‚Äôt mess around.Wow, contract price is different a month later? How could that be üò±üò±üò±Far from that point, but I‚Äôd be lying if I said my world didn‚Äôt crumble this morning. Mental panic attack.I remember this happening within this past year? So, he didn‚Äôt actually lose what he thought he did?? That makes it so much worse. :(Man, that was so tragic and stupid.Truly a sad story.He wasn't thinking, was the problem.Even if they owed that much, why not bankruptcy?  Doesn't bankruptcy only follow you for 7 years? (sometimes 10)  Wasn't that person in a position where they can't get blood from a stone?So... are you going to do this again?Its called a bubble.  Basically we are all in a casino right now.  Let he who can give a bullish case that doesn't involve the Fed cast the first stone.  

But seriously, even knowing you have the hedge, who hasn't gotten a little nervous the first time they got margin called?  That doubt that you might have fucked up kicks in till you double check.  ü§£I'll be honest--I'm new to the game. I'm trying to learn how it all works while getting some hands-on experience with it; there's just so much to absorb. I've only bought a couple of basic call options thus far. But this post got me worried now. You can make these sorts of mistakes and bury yourself in debt or am I misunderstanding the issue at hand?What options channel?Link to the options channel? Can‚Äôt tell who you‚Äôre replying too.  Thanks!>  wouldn‚Äôt I have to buy on the open market to sell them back to the call purchaser at $375? 

That is EXACTLY what your long 380C allows you to do. It allows you to buy 1000 shares (10 contracts) of AAPL at $380. That is exactly what the long call is there for.You don‚Äôt fully grasp the basics of exiting spreads yet you sold 10 of them?OP does. 

It's the proceeds from the selling stock short (because of assignment)He would already have the 1000 stocks at hand from the short position. When he exercise the long position, he's basically just buying it for the strike price. which is 380. That's how the 2k loss is incured.

Some people should seriously paper trade first to learn the basics of spread.The broker won't let you take the position if you couldn't to protect themselves.  They may refuse the order or if the order goes through, liquidate your positions.Don‚Äôt have enough capital to buy the shares now at 445 ea unfortunatelyYes, as long as you have level 3 options account w/ marginThe spread involves a contract hedging a short. 

Spread is long one contract and then short another.It is a loss of $2 per contract so 10 contracts=$20 and every contract is 100 shares so $2k total.

As somebody else mentioned, OP is liable for AAPL's dividend on 1000 shares sold short (because of assignment) as well, which is the whole reason this early exercise/assignment actualy happened so $0.82 per share would make it $820 added to the 2k for a total loss of $2820. 

Steep, but not catastrophic.I had this same question a long time ago.  Here is a nice write up that may answer your question [https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100314/whats-difference-between-long-and-short-position-market.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100314/whats-difference-between-long-and-short-position-market.asp)Only if you decide not to do anything about it then you're short/ long stock, which carries the same risk as anybody else who shorts/longs a stock. At that point, options don't have anything to do with it.

You can just buy/ sell the shares and you're back to anybody else who DOESN'T short/long a stock.> if I hold a debit spread of 400/450 for AAPL and the stock goes to 455. As long as I hold to expiration I should make (455 - 400 - initial debit).   


The max you can make in that scenario would be \[**450** \- 400\] - \[initial debit\]. You don't profit from anything beyond 450. 

> If I believe the stock will stay above the higher strike, there is no reason to exercise until just before expiration to maximize theta decay and get the max value from it, right? 

With a long call spread (the scenario you mention), you are better off closing the spread for max profit in the market prior to expiration, which means selling the call spread for close to max value, rather than exercising.

If for some reason you forget or just don't do it, you would be automatically exercised and assigned at expiration (google "exercise by exception"). It is a good practice to close your spread prior to expiration though.Exercise long call to buy stock at 380
With those shores bought at 380 you would cover the short stock position initiated at 375. 
Total P/L would be 375-380+[initial credit]-[dividend paid out because of short stock]On the contrary, remember that he is now SHORT the stock, so he profits dollar for dollar as AAPL goes down. It's a long way down though since he sold short at 375.You wouldn't want to exercise a long call if it's OTM (which would mean that the current stock price is lower than the call's strike price) or ATM (which would mean that the stock price is the same as the call's strike price).

In those cases it would be better for you to buy stock in the market without exercising your long call (better prices)You can exercise anytime but it only makes sense to do so when itm. You would only need to exercise the long call if it was also itm. If your short sale strike was itm but long was otm, it would be cheaper to cover at market price and let the otm call expire worthlessYou can exercise your option whenever you want. But it wouldn‚Äôt be wise to exercise out of the moneyBut the shares dropped .82, and he's short. He's even on that.The broker didn't short the stock, he ended up short the stock after someone exercised the calls he was short.  The broker doesn't find out this until much later in the evening, too late to do anything about it.  The trader is then issued a margin call and he can either liquidate the position or add money to the account.  The problem is it is now too late to avoid paying the dividend.Exactly. One of the worst things to happen to Main Street in the last five years is this normalization of trading complex financial instruments with no experience and little to no knowledge of how they work at a granular level. 

A lot of that can be blamed on RH and their oversimplified UI, but nobody is holding a gun to these people‚Äôs heads forcing them to buy zero-day puts or sell credit call spreads either.I don't blame RH, and think there are already too many regulations on trading. But that said, the reason that this was not common in the past is because RH lowered the bar to entry for trading options VERY low.I think no credit spread can be sold for extra income. I think you probably had to pay $500 to close it.No, what happened was you thought you knew what you were doing but didn‚Äôt. Wish they would make options trading more inaccessible to new investors.Yup. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frz0fp/my_broker_questrade_wants_me_to_sign_an_nda/Got you. Thankfully you are ok you'll take a minor loss and move on. Just to be extra fatherly and annoying: after your protective call is hit you already lost that bet, you should just close the spread and move on.I get it. The first time I was assigned, I panicked and immediately forgot everything I knew about it. After two or three times I learned that there's time to make a plan whether it's exercise the long leg or just reverse the shares and close the other leg or some third option.Ya I would highly recommend as well. Def something you should look into.but trueYou sold a call contract without owning the shares is that what naked calls are?He First sold 10 375 aug 21 calls (mid july)
they around $20.00 each or $2000/contract.
so he gained +20,000$ so far from sell those contracts.

now he brought 380 call aug 21 around $20.00 each (mid july price).
so at the moment he is more or less risk neutral

he was forced to cover due to ex-dividend or some other crap.
assuming he closed at the high on those 375 contracts at 80.00/each..
his trade balance should be at  negative $80,000...

now he still has his 380call aug 21. current value(3:27pm) at 66.30
or around $66,300...

now $66,300+(-$80,000)=$13,700...

so where is he losing 380k, and how?yeah you'll be just fine.  your max loss was capped with the spread position.It's just money. Never sweat over something that can be fixed in a court room in front of a judge (Bankruptcy). Be cool, always tell yourself it's going to be okay. If you need help, reach out to your support system (family, friends, loved ones) or the number below.

Obligatory suicide hotline number: 1-800-273-8255This has happened to me as well man. It‚Äôs a huge shock to see the number, and I was terrified. But it got sorted out after the protective hedge was executed. You‚Äôll be fine! Brush off the loss, take a break if need be, reflect on what you could‚Äôve done different in your due diligence and keep moving forward. Looking forward to seeing a post from you in a couple years about the gains you‚Äôre making. All the best man. ‚ù§Ô∏èü§òFuck man, I was panicking for you after reading your post. Thank GOD for this first comment.TD‚Äôs iOS app will every now and then will falsely flag my account and show a big yellow bar with ‚ÄúCall‚Äù written on it and I shit my pants everytime I see that, eventho I know nothing is wrong.Thanks for having the courage to ask for help and educating the rest of us simultaneously.This is why spreads are aka Defined risk trades.  Breathe easy.It's the way the phrase it...   Annoying as hellyeah like that naperville kid who jumped in front of a train after seeing his account go negative 700kSmart move making it a spread rather than a naked position!If you're referring to the Robinhood trader that killed himself, yes, he mis-read his account position being $700k in the red, but it wasn't nearly that bad. It was just uncleared balances, if he'd waited it would have sorted itself out.  [https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/06/17/20-year-old-robinhood-customer-dies-by-suicide-after-seeing-a-730000-negative-balance/#695afddd1638](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/06/17/20-year-old-robinhood-customer-dies-by-suicide-after-seeing-a-730000-negative-balance/#695afddd1638)yeah he killed himself over the weekend but the balance would have updated on mondayYeah, the system doesn't update that fast. Guess it waits for everything to fully clear.Some Romeo Juliet type shit.Part of the problem was the age, I believe. He was real young and he thought his life was over. Real sadOh yeah.I mean yeah no shit. The rest of these comments were retarded afI've only been trading for a little over a month but I wasn't scared when I got my first margin call on a stupid call credit spread on SPY that got executed. I knew exactly what my max loss could be and why that was the case. It blows my mind that people trade spreads but don't even seem to understand how they work. What would be the purpose of them if you could still have uncapped losses? What do these people think the purpose of them even is? To limit max gain?Most brokers will not allow you to naked sell unless you have a big account balance. I'm pretty new to options as well but was rejected by td ameritrade to execute spreads which is one of the safest plays in options (same thing op did). Buying calls and puts is safe - you only lose the amount you put in. Selling/writing calls and puts on the other hand can lead to an unwanted situation but like I said Good brokers don't enable these options by default and you have to show experience or an account balance to execute themThere's a small youtube channel called Options In Plain English. It's pretty good. Don't know if I've ever seen the redditor of the same name mention it, but I assume it's the same person.Thanks - I understand that... but I guess my concern is about the timing of the transactions. Assuming the short leg was exercised yesterday, shouldn‚Äôt it have add an extra day for settlement? Therefore my long exercise may not settle in time to cover my short sale?

I‚Äôm just surprised my broker did nothing with the long leg... I feel very exposed.Even if it was naked max loss would be $444-$375 * 1000 = 69,000 as of todays price? (Not saying that is good, but a lot better than 380,000!!)The future favors the brave!Paper trading, yes, that place where things like unwinding early assignment would definitely be learnedYou don't, but u/ScooterToTheMoon is totally correct here. Great catch.

What if, not in a single transaction but you first sell your long call which is trading 65.05 x 65.65 so that should bring around 65K to your account, plus your 375K from the short sale and a bit of your capital, should give you enough.

And he is right, this would (as of right now when the market is closed though) cover your dividend because your long call has around $0.82 of extrinsic value ($820).

My advice would be to check with your broker about the mechanics of this and if you are able to do this, it would be even better than exercising your long call since your dividend would be covered with the current extrinsic value on your long call.

EDIT: What is your approval level? Your broker won't let you go naked if you are only approved for spreadsI'd call the broker and see if they'd level you out that way.  Even if you can't do it, they should do it for you to save you the $800.

When I have spreads blow up on me, I exit as a single trade - sell the option and buy/sell the assigned shares.  Then you don't need the capital because the option value plus the value of the shares should come out to your max loss; and you keep the extrinsic value.

The main point is figure out a way to sell your calls instead of exercising them early.My broker let‚Äôs me option positions like this but without margin. I have to have the cash to cover the spread and they basically treat my account as not having that cash until the position is closed.Thanks! Btw I loved your video on pin risk, super helpfulHow does anyone trade options without having read this shit üòêI guess what i mean is, I do spreads because my risk is capped and my entry is smaller. I don't have the capital to say just sell a cash covered put so I do a spread, what happens if you lose a leg to assignment but then end up not being able to exercise the other leg that is meant to cover the first leg.So he wouldn't be selling his shares, just using them to cover the short stock position right?He exercised the long legs.But my question is: why clear it like this, i.e., by borrowing the shares rather than buy them and borrow the difference in currency or better exercising the other leg? it feels like a weird procedure, is it because it's cleared out after the market is closed?When AAPL came back down under 370 just prior to earnings, I was net positive $500 or so on the spread.But then who are you going to sell your bags to?You must have lots of friends.It went without sayingNo, that's not what naked calls are. Jesus christ.Hmm, you actually don't understand what an option contract really means.[deleted]This is the point of spreads. They reduce risk while reducing profits.This x1000%

I really hate the stigma that's attached with defaulting on debt or filing BK. It's all just business. Don't treat it as a personal shortcoming so much as a smart business decision.This deserves all the goldIs the option value based on percentages or a fix value? What I mean is say I buy 20 contract at 10 cent each for 200. Would my money doubel every time the contract went up 20 cent or is it just the dollar amount  of the contract times 100Our whole world revolves around money and working 40 to 80 hour weeks just to justify making money for survival and you say its just money?Thanks bud!Robinhoods been killin the PR this last year>75c 21Aug20

RIP man, this really sucks.Should have just declared bankruptcy.  Not like we have debtors prisons.ü§£Td requires both from my experience. I‚Äôm not eligible for naked options yet thanks to both, and I‚Äôm okay with that because I‚Äôd likely sink myself during the learning curve. Instead, I‚Äôll continue making my few bucks a week playing it safe and take some risks from there.Got it! Thank you for taking the time to clarify.Well your long leg will cover your short sale regardless of when it‚Äôs exercised. The main thing you would need to be concerned about is borrowing fees for being short AAPL. Luckily, these fees are way lower than if you were trading some HTB stock like NKLAAlso this poster has a fine YouTube channel you should likely pay a visit to, same name as reddit username.I know the other comment answered this, but just to put it in more simple terms:

Owning the contract itself is the protection. This is because you currently own a piece of paper stating you have the right to the shares.

Whether you exercise it right now or later still gives the same protection because you own the rights.Sarcasm in an internet comment, classy, but paper trading for  say 6 months prior may have imparted some valuable experience such as not holding a credit spread over dividendsSome of the finest sarcasm I‚Äôve heard in a while. Well played.Oh I hear you!  This reminds me of the .com bubble all over again.Yeah, I missed that they were ITM too. That sucks.

But in the case of a "tweener," you make up the dividend, but you have to be careful to account for it only once.The early exercise of OP's short calls was submitted to the OCC by a long holder prior to a deadline of 530pm on the day preceding the ex-dividend date.

OP's broker does not get notified by the OCC about the assignment from the short calls until well after the 530pm deadline. They aren't able to go back in time and also exercise the long calls for OP.

To avoid losing the dividend, OP could have either

* exercised his long calls on the day preceding the ex-dividend date, or
* closed the position prior to the ex-dividend date.It's too late in the day to exercise the other leg when the broker finds outI will not keep arguing the point but I find it extremely unlikely it'd be on top. You might be shown $500 profit but that's including closing out your short call and hence paying the difference. I.e. after paying $2750 to close your short call (your obligation) and selling your hedge for $250 you will be left with $500.??? That's exactly what a naked call is.lol hey fuckwad yea thats literally exactly absolutely what selling naked calls are jEsUS cHrIStyes... I must have landed on my head....
my series 67 license must be nothing....

yes yes random person on the i must not understand my job, my field or everything else.Good instincts. Learn everything you can about the investment products you are buying or selling.When you are starting out buy and sell ‚ÄúCash Secured‚Äù puts and calls, (you will automatically cap any potential loss simply by doing this, and you can even further mitigate your over all potential loss by doing spreads like the OP, with your Cash Secured positions)

 But in the beginning Do Not Touch Margined / Naked calls and puts, 

Then once you get a handle on the mechanics you can dabble your feet in the deeper water of Naked / Margin positions.Even when you know what's going on its still a little nerve wracking to see that big negative number.Good idea. But this is more of the way things look like as they close out vs anything the market does.Quit trying to promote that sub. I see posts everyday in all sorts of stock subs saying the exact same thing.Mods can you ban?Yes. A lot of noobs dealing with spreads when they have no business to be doing soWhat would his max profit be on this trade?Personal bankruptcy carries far more weight than bankruptcy for a business. You can lose assets you thought were safe, you can ruin your credit, make your life hell if you need to rent somewhere since many places look very poorly on bankruptcy.

That being said, it rolls off your credit in 7 years. So if you are really fucked, declare bankruptcy, work it out, and make sure you are smarter with money the next time around. 

I wish bankruptcy for individuals didn't devastate a person's financial well being so much. I understand why it is the way it is, but it would be nice if it wasn't so vilified.Entirely. The system is broken ("Our whole world revolves around money and working 40 to 80 hour weeks just to justify making money for survival") but has safety valves when you‚Äôve fucked up. If you‚Äôve dug too deep, just pull the emergency cable, go BK, and get a fresh start. Don't cry over some brokerage's reserves they'll have cough up to make the counterparty whole because their risk management sucked.Wasn‚Äôt there a guy who went into over two million dollars in debt from trading his student loans and then pulled himself out of debt and is now investing as a millionaire?Ahhhhhh I think I‚Äôm getting it now. The broker would allow me to remain short (if I had enough equity to not be margin called) until I exercised the long leg. I‚Äôd just be paying the borrow fee until then. Thanks!Borrowing fees not a problem here, paying the dividend is.Ahhh yup, you‚Äôre right.It's a spread. Spreads are, by definition, not naked.

You sell a 400c, buy a 410c. Do you own shares? No. Is it a naked call? No.
Any other answers are wrong.What OP did is not a naked call. At all. That's a fact. Call me any name you want, that won't change.Why do you keep calling a credit spread a naked call?Or just never go in naked, which is probably a better move.3kIt depends on what state you're in. For example, in Florida we have a rather generous homestead exemption. Basically, you can keep your home in BK - even if you own it free and clear. 

Your credit score will definitely take a big hit but there are plenty of banks who will approve people immediately out of bankruptcy... Even if you just discharged a debt that same bank held. 

Yes, you'll pay a bit more for credit at the beginning, but after about six months of timely payments, your credit score will start to rise dramatically. 

You'll be back to having decent credit (though not perfect) and getting approved at decent interest rates within 2-3 years.Good point, you‚Äôre definitely rightHow does he need to pay the dividend?I'm quoting Micky here:
"You sold a call contract without owning the shares is that what naked calls are?"

Yes, OP did not only sell a call contract so Micky got that part of the post incorrect, but Micky's scenario is a naked call.

Anyway, seems like we both agree, we were just analyzing Micky's post differently.ha whatever either way I'm not the dipshit that owes $12kthanksThe short leg was exercised last night. AAPL ex-div date was today at 9 AM. Meaning he was short 1000 shares as of ex-div time. But I don't think the long side was exercised yet by him or his broker. So he owes dividends on the short side, but he won't receive any on the long side since he didn't have possession (the long options exercised) as of 9 AM.Because when he was assigned, it made him short stock the day before the ex dividend date. When he covers the position today, its now too late to avoid the dividend, as the stock is now trading "ex dividend". This was the reason the holder of his shorts exercised.His 180c won't pay a dividend, because it wasn't exercised yesterday (in time for exdiv). However he owes for the short positionEven in that sense, it's not a naked call because I can sell a call to open without owning shares and without being short a naked call.

If I buy a call fly on a name where I have no existing position, I sell two calls to open, but they're not naked calls because most of their risk is covered by the two calls that I buy.

However, I don't own any shares.

Checkmate u/yosimba2000.Makes sense, thanks.Ah, he owes dividends to whoever loaned him the stock to sell short. Makes sense, thanks.Naked call refers to the whole position, not just a single leg...
If you have a butterfly open, it's not a naked call.

Or it is, I suppose how the terminology is used. I've never refered to a naked call as a naked call if there was another position to offset it.So 1000 AAPL x 0.82/share = $820?That's why the short contract in a callspread is not a naked call.

>I've never refered to a naked call as a naked call if there was another position to offset it.

Me neither.Lol, sounds like we agree on all fronts then :)According to this: [https://web.tmxmoney.com/article.php?newsid=6033285200485779&qm\_symbol=BNP](https://web.tmxmoney.com/article.php?newsid=6033285200485779&qm_symbol=BNP)

There was a shareholder vote on two options in the  recapitalization transaction for shareholders of their common stock.

1. Hold on to you shares: It will go through a share exchange and then a consolidation. 750 \* 1.51204 / 58.98 = 19.22, OR
2. Cash election option: payout at 0.05 cent for your current 750 shares.

&#x200B;

During the shareholder vote, Option 2 was chosen. [https://web.tmxmoney.com/article.php?newsid=5644552078407445&qm\_symbol=BNP](https://web.tmxmoney.com/article.php?newsid=5644552078407445&qm_symbol=BNP) 

&#x200B;

Hence, everyones shares are going to be exchanged at $0.05. Thats why the price on BNP has not moved beyond 0.045 and 0.05.

&#x200B;

PS: I would suggest reading the news releases from any company. They actually explain a lot on what is happening.I own some shares and can never seem to be able to sell them at 0.050. My orders never get filled I guess because of super low volumeI hate taking losses but I was so happy to sell at $0.20 when this was announced. 

My cost average was $3.50 (years of cost averaging down) but there's no way I was ever going to I see that again.Sorry, still not sure I understand! 

‚Äúeveryones shares are going to be exchanged at $0.05‚Äù

What does ‚Äòexchanged‚Äô mean in this context? The company is going private and so all shares are being bought out?

I‚Äôve tried reading but still don‚Äôt understand the future of this company...The exchange part is highlighted below. Essentially all existing commons shareholders will sell their shares at $0.05 to G2S2 Capital Inc. This resolution got approved by the courts on Aug 4, 2020

>In addition, the special resolution (the "**Shareholders' Cash Arrangement Resolution**") approving the option of having all Existing Shareholders, other than G2S2 Capital Inc. ("**G2S2**"), and its affiliates and associates, receive $0.05 in cash in exchange for each pre-consolidation Common Share under the Plan of Arrangement to be paid by G2S2,  ...

G2S2 appears to be a company held by the director according to this:  [https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/bonavista-energy-corp-g2s2-capital-calgary-alberta-1.5619769](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/bonavista-energy-corp-g2s2-capital-calgary-alberta-1.5619769)

~~It sounds like they are pivoting to a privatization (I may be wrong..), since one holding company will now own all the common shares. In addition, all their previous debt got converted into another form of longer term debt under the recapitalization transaction.~~

~~Are there any financial experts lurking this reddit board who would like to chime in on this matter?~~

edit: I  quickly scanned the recapitalization transaction again.

What is happening with BNP is that they are NOT going to become private. They restructured their debt. The skinny is:

* Current existing shareholders will sell their shares to G2S2. (Bye bye current shareholders)
* Their current senior debtholders (Senior Note holders) will get their debt converted into a new form of longer term debt and revolving line of credit, PLUS will be issued new common shares. Hence, those senior debtholders will now be pretty much the new shareholders of the company.Money doesn't have a footprint, so I'm not sure how they can say "you bought this stock on margin" when you can just argue back "I actually bought this other stock with margin, so piss off".

I could be wrong for sure, I have no idea how it worksI'm pretty sure they don't, but I'm not 100% certainThey deduct the margin interest once a month from your balance. If the interest owed on margin is greater than your monthly dividend payments then essentially they are taking them.

If you own shares on margin that yield 5% or less then you are giving the dividend to Robinhood over the quarter. You can use covered calls to get the shares above 5% yield so you make money holding them, but you are selling the upside and doubling your downside price risk.

To be clear tho they do not keep the dividend they pay it out to your account. If you go this route just make sure you can deposit enough cash to handle margin calls so you don't get forced to sell margin shares at a big loss when you don't want to.They will he bought by another big logistics company or Amazon if their tech is good enoughThey have been ard forever, without real ways to generate revenue till today.

Goes to show why following the advice provided on reddit by a stranger in general will be a bad idea.This is why r/wsb requires proof or bantip: never take options buying advice from an option sellerThanks for this. I don't understand why people don't grasp the simplest rule of any public forum, especially an anonymous one like this. People are self serving first. If someone tells you to buy, it's likely because they have something to sell and vice versa. There are a ton of helpful comments and great people that do a great job at educating people but there are plenty of people trying to convince you to lose your money to them. There is no easy money. If something ever feels too good to be true, trust that feeling and never make large bets on a paradigm you haven't researched/understand.[deleted]OP's an idiot. The entire play is to day trade the calls, aka buy calls around 169, gtfo at 171 or 172. 

OP's entire premise of "oh you lose 3000 dollars if you hold to expiration" shows his lack of understanding of not just the play but the entire concept of trading as well.I am the redditor u/hollowpoint38 is speaking of. He is incorrect on a few major points. 

1) I never advised, would never advise, and did not personally hold to expiration any option.
2) I and others who have reached out to me profited quite a bit. One gentleman profited $8,000.
 off of 100 calls. 
3) I bought the expirations in the following order

- 8/3 BTO TLT 170c 8/14 @ 0.93
- 8/4 STC TLT 170c 8/14 @ 1.77
- 8/5 BTO TLT 171.5c 8/14 @ 0.78
- 8/6 STC TLT 171.5c 8/14 @ 1.57

I have done this strategy (involving the fed QE, outstanding bonds on the secondary market (/zb); compared with indirect, direct, and primary dealers listed on the treasury website results page) many times to much success and have also helped others as well on our unusual options discord, found at r/unusual_whales 

I‚Äôm on mobile right now and will post screenshots at a later time today. I was simply trying to let people know a great strategy in reference to bonds, but for some reason you took it upon yourself to attack me.Omg I thought I was in /r/wallstreetbets until I scrolled down to see the automoderator comment. I was reading OP's post thinking "wtf why is he pointing out the obvious?", which is why WSB is a great subreddit because there is no pretense of expertise its just the wild west and you're on your own for filtering out all the bullshit.The TLDR of this thread is that OP is having a total breakdown. It's funny to read though.This is probably a scam from the poster.

I am extremely bearish on TLT (in 10 years, I expect it to drop to less than $100 due to extreme inflation) but I do not suggest using short term options to bet on this. You can use options (like $170 puts) that expire in 1 to 2 years.

Short term options = gambling or speculation, period.[removed]Looking at the chart, it would have been profitable if buying the call on 8/4 and selling on 8/5.   I don't recall the exact dates of when Fed was buying and don't feel like looking it up, but that could have been profitable as a day./swing trade.  The biggest mistake here was using an option that expired on 8/7.  It would still have value if the expiry was next week.Sounds a lot like a certain 2020s bear who was banned from a lot of these subs. All he does is draw charts and scream crash and when nothing happens like he said, he spins it to some how still make himself sound right but nothing in the way of valid proof showing profit. Lots of scams here on the various investment subs.I called the guy out in the comments and got a super toxic response about how smart he was and how stupid I was. This makes me lol.Wow dude you're a dope. Why is this post still up?>The claim was that it was "guaranteed money" 

What is this, WSB?So I worked for a bank for a while (statistical modeling not trading), but one of the modelers worked for a hedge fund doing  algorithm options trading. The one thing that has stuck with me to this day was one night when we were at a company dinner in NYC. I was talking about how I had started options trading. I'd always make $1k-$2k think I figured it out, then I'd lose $3k. But when I was talking about it he told me as an individual investor trading options to profit is the dumbest thing you can do. You're getting against incredibly smart people, banks, and algorithms. The only time it is somewhat smart to trade is hedging. I love reading about options and seeing people's strategies, but I've stayed out since hearing from a guy with a PhD who did it as a career. It's risky stuff.This is a good post. I also refuse to play with options as that's out of my wheelhouse and I'd rather learn first (vids, paper trading) before learning with real dollars.I've never bought options and probably never will. I've read a lot about them but don't understand them enough to actually buy them.What was the major factor leading to the massive drop in the price per contract? Was it decay of one of the major Greeks, that it's now close to expiration and not ITM, or something else? I'm still new to options and trying to better understand what you've written, so if there's any major misconceptions, please do feel free to correct.I saw your comments in that post too. Nothing is fool proof when it comes to options trading.  Glad you take time to save some people's money out there. BTW were you active in VS (from wsb) discussion threads back in Mar-Apr? Your name sounds familiar to me.While I agree with the rest of your post, if someone asks me to post screenshots, I typically won‚Äôt bother.

There are a lot of greedy people taking advantage of people because of their misfortune or bad trade. Stay safe/u/Hollowpoint38 you've been a real asset to this community, especially this year during all this volatility and misinformation that came with it.

Just wanted to say thanks, as I've tagged you as "A brash dose of sanity" and you never disappoint.I knew I recognized your username. That was the TLT post by /u/dramaticdan and you were challenging his stupid fucking **BUY@1030,CANT GO TITS UP** Bullshit. Yeah he claimed to make money after the fact but I watched and 1030 did not jump like he said it would. Dudes a piece of shit, and you're due diligence kept other people out of it I hope.A quality post. Thanks for the infoHah.

If someone a) blindly buys something someone told them to on the internet, especially a high risk options contract or b) holds an OTM contract until expiration when said contract was up 150-300% at midweek, then they deserve to lose money. 

Regardless, I don't think any post is meant to be some sort of "must-do." If you think someone's call or DD is somewhat valid, look into it yourself and decide when to enter/exit/avoid/go in. I have no sympathy for people who don't do the latter or don't do any work themselves, again, they deserve to lose money.you're a good egg.But I read it was true on the Internet. Now I‚Äôm confused. (Sarcasm)Why would anyone lie on the internet?  What is the point?Go away, OP, no one said anything about holding to expiry.I have been telling newbies the dangers of options for years but no one heeds my advise.You wrote all that to tell people not to mess with weekly options?Uh oh. OP make oopsie trade and get burnt? This post could have been trimmed to ‚Äúdo your own due diligence‚ÄùBuddy its your own fault you bought such early expirations! TLT is a mo they play at least, look at the chart. Why would it be anything but that with the MOVE index as low as it is?Yeah binary options on securities that don't have a lot of price fluctuation is very risky.  I can understand selling options on them because you want some steady premium income and don't mind assignment, but buying them as speculation of a big price movement is just not a good idea.

And you can see it in the post comments too, it's not like I'm sitting here with hindsight saying it's bad.  I called it a bad trade at the time when no one knew what price would be at expiration.> Goes to show why following the advice provided on reddit by a stranger in general will be a bad idea.

#LUMBER LIQUIDATORSI responded to OP‚Äôs post above.

No options play is guaranteed money and nobody should jump into options with that expectation.  Yes, buying naked calls is highly risky and probably shouldn't be called investing.  Still, I've been in and out of TLT calls using the QE schedule to guide my timing all summer and the profits have been good.  

If you purchased TLT calls any time between last Friday and Tuesday, you definitely had opportunities to sell them profitably on or before Thursday.>OP's an idiot.

No, the stated strategy was hold to expiration.  Day-trading calls was never discussed.

And name-calling won't get you anywhere.So you can post a well formatted multi paragraph response on mobile but can‚Äôt send some screenshots??>but for some reason you took it upon yourself to attack me.

I have not attacked you personally at all.  I don't name-call and I don't insult.  I will go after your credibility based on your statements and I'll attack ideas.  But I don't attack people.

I leave that kind of thing to you.  Might have something to do with your post being deleted?  Not sure.Yeah the content in here from the last 18-24 months will make you look twice.  I've got a guy right now trying to tell me that receiving a dividend from a company is a "net zero financial gain."  Unreal.

Had a guy an hour ago who kept misquoting me and then I found out he thought that writing an option and buying an option were "the same thing.">This is probably a scam from the poster.

He was really pushing it.  It wasn't a troll or anything.  And then you can see a couple of other guys jumping in as well.

>You can use options (like $170 puts) that expire in 1 to 2 years.

The problem is Theta decay will tear you apart when you have an expiration in 2 years.  You pay a lot of premium for that kind of time horizon.  All of my options buys have expirations 3-8 weeks out, max.  Anything over 2 months and you're paying a lot of money for that timing.

>Short term options = gambling or speculation, period.

Well I use weekly options a lot as limit orders when I want to buy a stock.  So I'll sell puts at my target price.  If it fills, then I get a small discount because of the premium.  If it doesn't, then I can roll it forward and collect more premium until it does hit.

EDIT:  downvoted for mentioning Theta decay and ways to use options as limit orders.  I guess some people still aren't getting it in here.  Knowledge is always better than no knowledge.  Oh well.I responded to OP‚Äôs post above>OP is dumb as fuck

Little uncalled for don't you think?Hindsight is 20/20.  Anyone can go look at the historical chart and tell me when they *could* have made money.  Pull up any stock and I can draw circles around dips and peaks all day./r/cryptocurrency is famous for the historical pricing charts with circles, lines, and logarithmic scales.  The result was an investment that was headed up at a 45 degree angle until the end of time.  We would always share those in /r/buttcoin and some of the crypto guys would come in there and get totally demolished.I responded to OP‚Äôs post aboveI responded above. And yeah, I was pretty annoyed at all the hate and trolling even though I kept explicitly stating the exact same thing verbatim over and over only to be called a liar.Tell me about it.  I'm in it with one guy right now where I said I write puts and he's telling me I said I'm *buying* them.  I think he doesn't know the difference.

Got another guy who said that since dividends are taken out from retained earnings, that it's a "zero net gain" for the stockholder.  Like what in the actual fuck?  I'll be here all day but I don't know where these guys come from.You know I swear during the last 18-24 months this sub has actually gotten worse than WSB.  WSB is a troll sub and they don't pretend to be anything else.  But in the comments a lot of guys do know their stuff and you can have some good conversations.

This sub is *supposed* to be a real sub about real topics, but I've seen some of the weirdest beliefs and worst advice you would encounter.  People don't know the tax code, they don't know SEC trading regulations, don't know GAAP, they get hung up on "investing vs trading" or say that "options are gambling" and all sorts of things.

So the post didn't surprise me at all.  What surprised me was how many people jumped in and said "Wow, that sounds awesome.  I need to get in on that trade."  Like, are you guys being serious?  Binary options on TLT?  And also how many people went completely sideways on me for questioning the strategy.  Saying things like "Have fun being broke" and other ridiculous arguments.I don't agree with that guy.  Options have made me a decent amount of money.  I also use options as limit orders so instead of just opening a limit order I will write an option at that strike price and I get what I want either way.  Either the stock at that price or the premium for writing the option when it expires out of the money.

Saying "Options bad" is an oversimplification.Be careful with paper trading as it teaches you to fill orders a certain way that they don't fill in real life.  So you get comfortable operating a certain way but then when you trade real dollars the fills don't go as smoothly.  And it can be tough to un-learn the way you learn with paper trading.

This is a big thing about going with a good broker too.  I often talk about "order fill" and people think it's some nebulous concept but it's very real.  I've been sitting right next to someone using one broker and I'm using another and my orders are filling and his are not being filled.  Same security same price same everything.

It's always good to get more knowledge and learn.  There's no rush and it's always better to be comfortable and know the instrument than to be hasty and take hits.Ditto, it's just too close to gambling.  With a dose of major financial complexity thrown in.>What was the major factor leading to the massive drop in the price per contract?

Price of the ETF.  A 170 Call means you need to rise well above that to regain the price of your contracts and make profit.  The price dropped below 170 so the Calls are worth nothing.  His hypothesis was since the Fed was buying bonds, the price of TLT would continue to rise and rise, justifying the strike price.

Another reason is theta decay.  As you move closer to expiration you lose some value if you're out of the money.  You lose value either way but you lose more if you're OTM because there is less of a probability that the stock hits your target.OP is a fuckin bozo who doesn't understand how options work. He probably held through expiry instead of selling at the top when TLT was at ~172 (which it has hit multiple times).

100% guarantee he held his positions which expired today until today and he's scratching his mongoloid head wondering why they expired worthless.

Just for reference, I bought TLT calls earlier this week when it was down and sold yesterday for profit.

Edit: Saw another post where OP said he didn't buy anything. So he's straight up talking out of his ass and he clearly doesn't understand how options work at all. So he's still a bozo, but at least he's not a bozo who blew his life savings playing with fire.I have only posted in WSB a couple of times.  I like reading the comments but it's a little too over-the-top trolly for me.

I have a lifetime ban in /r/RobinHood for mentioning order flow payments they receive.  I got the ban and then the SEC fined them about a month later.

I got a 60-day ban in /r/M1Finance for my "tone".  So I'm around here and there.>You have all the reason to be skeptical to an internet stranger, but neither do I have to prove myself to an internet stranger.

Which is fine, but then there goes all of our fun.  What I find interesting is that it took a lot more effort for this guy and his cronies to say I'm an idiot and "Have fun being broke" than just posting the order tickets.Yeah I think the post hit a nerve too as I'm being called all types of angry names.Your submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

Yeah I mean if you can sell options on Treasury ETFs, I'd say that's not a bad way to make money.  I would never thought someone would be dumb enough to take the other end of that trade, but I guess they exist.>I have no sympathy for people who don't do the latter or don't do any work themselves, again, they deserve to lose money.

Well it's not fair for their family.  I remember seeing the Chinese guy who put all of his savings into a short position at Binance or some crypto exchange.  The exchange artificially took out his short position.  He lost it all.  Showed up at the HQ and wanted to talk to the CEO.  He was holding a bottle of poison and was threatening to drink it and kill himself unless the CEO came out and talked to him in the lobby.

The video ended and I don't know if he drank it, but he claimed his wife had taken their infant child and left him and he had nothing.

So yeah it's easy to say that the individual who takes the advice "deserves to lose money" but do their kids and family members deserve that too?  Does a kid deserve to have a hard life because his father is a dipshit?  What if that guy drank the poison?  Now the kid has no father and will be raised by a single mom in China because the father thought that crypto exchanges were honest places of business.In this sub it went from "options are just gambling" about a year ago, which I disagree with, to all of these crazy schemes of recent like buying binary options on Treasury ETFs with 4 days til expiry.

There's no middle ground.No I don't trade options against Treasury ETFs.  I made that clear at the time the first post when up and my messaging is consistent.

If the paragraphs are a burden for you to read, feel free to skip them or feel free to block me so that you don't have to read my content.  That's what the button is for.I didn't buy anything.  Did you even read the post?I'm gonna reply here because this is the top comment chain.

>But that's not the scary part.  As of right now, the price is 5 cents.

You obviously don't understand options. They were 5 cents when you posted this because they were about to expire worthless. You DO NOT hold options til expiry, unless you think the day of expiry is when they'll be at their highest value (this is very rarely the case, unless you're buying cheap short term expiries with the intent to flip them).

Looking at the value of an option when it's OTM and 0 days to expiry, and then concluding that it wasn't a good play is like taking a drink from an expired carton of milk and concluding that the milk was sour 3 days ago.

Look at the chart for TLT. It was over 172 yesterday. If you bought calls when it was lower than 172 and then sold at the peak, you probably made profit. If you bought calls when it was below 170 earlier in the week and sold at 172, you guaranteed made profit. If you bought calls, missed the peak and held til close today then you lost all your money. That's how options work.

Edit, as an aside for anyone reading this who doesn't understand options: options can be very high risk and you should not trade options unless you have a firm understanding of how they work and the risks involved.

Edit2: Here is a [10d chart](https://imgur.com/lKcxCWb) of the option OP mentioned. Objective proof that you're mistaken. You could have about tripled your money with impeccable timing. Hell, buying end of day Wednesday and selling anytime between ~7:30 to 8:30 Thursday morning was about 100% profit.Clearly people who operate on these 'get rich quick schemes' especially with straight call or put options are... VERY uneducated about REAL option strategies that you're describing here. As someone who has worked in the industry for many decades, but has avoided options licensing, I at least understand how difficult they truly are WHEN you don't have the knowledge required to be aware of all risks, and how to operate in a timely manner, how to set up proper covered strategies so you're not left naked (if your broker even lets you, most have processes to prevent uneducated folks from getting them including 'tests' on how a certain contract would be filled or what the profit would be on a certain spread, etc)  


Thanks for trying to help people who otherwise have no chance against basically misinformation/lies/unintended consequences from other similar people (thinking they're getting "pro advice")Have you ever traded binary? Open a paper trading account. You learn real quick on the 15 minute gambles..if they ran a debit spread they might have been able to scrape a profit though...[removed]I liked that options trader who did an AMA on WSB and literally said "I sell a lot of calls here"And Hertz and Kodak. I think Wall Street Bets is hilarious but people get sucked up in that and make really stupid decisions. The AR clerk at my work told me she bought a bunch of Kodak stock last week and literally had no idea what she was doing. Made some money and sold that day. Good job right? She bought it again the day after and lost more than what made on the initial trade. Not sure how much overall but she‚Äôs also a  divorced single mom of 2 who‚Äôs ex isn‚Äôt paying child support.You've literally been blatantly ignoring the fact that litearlly every single time anyone ever talked about TLT in this particular context is in day-trading, no one's ever fucking advocated holding to expiration.

You're an idiot, it is what it is. I kept saying "scalp it" and you made a whole thread. 

Sad, bro.With a dividend you gain cash but that comes out of the stocks value. So net zero gain. Otherwise it would be an excellent arbitrage opportunity; buy before the ex dividend date, sell after. In theory it is net zero, in practice your mileage may vary. Now dividends are taxed right away so you have no choice but to pay taxes that year and can't delay taking income gains on it. Dividends are overrated and are basically forced selling of your stock IMO. Why not decide when you want to take gains on your own?Time value scales with square root of time so on a relative basis theta is worse for shorted dated options.  Not sure why you would recommend short expiries if the concern is burning theta.You're being downvoted because you don't understand how theta decays. Higher DTE and/or deeper ITM or OTM, the more linear the decay.

There's ways to express long term bearish views in way that nets theta gains over time.Can you explain your last paragraph? I understand you're long the underlying and if you sell a put (that means you're long the underlying, right?). What if the stock prices drops and the counter party exercises the option (i.e. they force you to buy?) It's not bad right, since you were long the stock anyways and made $XX in premiums? Guess you'd need a lot of cash assuming your purchasing 100\*X number of contracts. What does "roll it forward and collect more premium until it does hit" mean? Sorry - I'm a newb.I mean you wrote a whole post plus multiple comments explaining how Dan was wrong yet you didn‚Äôt know how the play worked. Isn‚Äôt that a little uncalled for?it would work with a day or swing strategy that takes profit on the first meaningful candle or level after the position was opened, which is a typical short term strategy.I'm not who you're "in it" with, but you said:

>The problem is Theta decay will tear you apart when you have an expiration in 2 years. You pay a lot of premium for that kind of time horizon. All of my options buys have expirations 3-8 weeks out, max.lmao, I've come to the same conclusion. WSB doesn't pretend to be extremely knowledgeable whereas most people here can't even tell you what EBITDA means but seem to think they know it all.I've always wondered about writing options. Never done it myself, but it seems like it could be safer. I guess it's all about how risk adverse you are. Glad some people are making money with options!Fido a good brokerage to use for filling options?Is it as simple as the big brokerages with bigger fees offer better order fill service than the cheap/free ones?>Price of the ETF.

Why did the price of the ETF fall though? ETFs are like weighted baskets of their constituents, in this case Treasury bonds, so did something happen to make the price of these bonds go down?Yeah the ones who got caught with their pants down.Just about any established equity, fund, commodity have available options.  You will surely lose money in the long run playing with them though.  If i could by puts on people‚Äôs c/p options I would do it all day; the house always wins in the long run.Options are insurance contracts so use them accordingly.Not hard to read just excessive and unnecessary. Playing options on treasury ETFs is a legitimate strategy. Again, you could have shaved this post to five words, ‚Äúdo your own due diligence‚ÄùOkay, but still you're looking at it on a weekly timeframe. You can see the average moves this ticker makes. Not huge, sellers defended today nothing crazy. Q.E is on deck for Monday, itl catch a bid again then.\^this

lol @ that quote.  

OP is probably correct to caution folks in a forum that isn't options-centric against blindly jumping into high risk plays like trading TLT calls.  However, they could do that without being disingenuous about the way this particular play worked.

It was a very successful play.  

If you bought TLT calls today while it was under 170, you're probably in good shape for next week, too.  Of course, nothing is certainty and this is still a *high risk play*.bro in hindsight that all looks good smh. if someone was perfect at timing options they would be a billionaire in little to no time...Looks like OP got told.>You obviously don't understand options.

I trade them weekly.

>They were 5 cents when you posted this because they were about to expire worthless.

That's right.  The previous OP chose the 170 strike, chose the expiration, and chose the strategy to hold until expiry and then profit.  It didn't work out.  His price target was off.

>unless you think the day of expiry is when they'll be at their highest value (this is very rarely the case, unless you're buying cheap short term expiries with the intent to flip them)

I don't try to get inside people's heads and do the most rational thing.  I've got a guy right now arguing with me about GAAP fundamentals.  I'm not going to assume he knows what he's doing and then pretend he's just having an off day.

>Looking at the value of an option when it's OTM and 0 days to expiry, and then concluding that it wasn't a good play is like taking a drink from an expired carton of milk and concluding that the milk was sour 3 days ago.

No, it's more like telling the guy that in 3 days I'm going to pull the price and see what it looks like and him saying "Go ahead, I'll make money and you'll be broke."  Then I check in 3 days.

>Look at the chart for TLT. It was over 172 yesterday. If you bought calls when it was lower than 172 and then sold at the peak, you probably made profit.

That's possible, but that wasn't the strategy and that wasn't the challenge.  Anyone can look at a historical pricing chart, find the peak, draw a circle, and then claim they *could have* sold there.  That's sort of silly.

>If you bought calls when it was below 170 earlier in the week and sold at 172, you guaranteed made profit. If you bought calls, missed the peak and held til close today then you lost all your money. That's how options work.

Lots and lots of "ifs".  In investing, when you see those "ifs" all over the place, that's a bad sign.

>Objective proof that you're mistaken. You could have about tripled your money with impeccable timing.

So first it's objective, then it's "could have" which means it's a hypothetical scenario.  Got it...Thank you for posting this I felt like I was taking crazy pills.You could have made over 100% profit buying calls straight up, if you timed the play correctly.I can apply that to any trade on the market.  Go back in time, change up my strategy, voila.  It made money.  Too bad that's not how reality works.  Hindsight is 20/20.

Wish I bought Apple in the 1980's.  Wish I bought in big with Microsoft right when the anti-trust actions were announced in the late 90's.

But then just as there are Apples and Microsofts there are Pets.com, Sears, Webvan, and Krispy Kreme.

You can't turn the clock back and pick and choose.This is still exactly what OP is saying. All you did is post a chart of TLT. Post your options trade screenshot if you actually made money. You know, a buy and a sell that shows net profit.> Eat shit op you're dumb

Wow.> The AR clerk at my work told me she bought a bunch of Kodak stock last week and literally had no idea what she was doing. Made some money and sold that day. Good job right? She bought it again the day after and lost more than what made on the initial trade.

This.  This is key.  A broken clock is right twice a day.  But over the long haul is what counts.  The classic trope of "Check out this **one** trade that I made money on!!"  That doesn't pay the bills.This is the psychology problem with buying and trading stocks.  Like gambling, people do not know when to walk away.  If they don't know much, then they certainly don't know anything about risk management either.>You're an idiot

Seems you just can't help yourself.>With a dividend you gain cash but that comes out of the stocks value. So net zero gain.

Sorry that's not how it works.  The stock is valued by the market itself.  Nothing "comes from the value."  You're confusing book value with market value.  They are distinct.

>Otherwise it would be an excellent arbitrage opportunity; buy before the ex dividend date, sell after.

That's a common strategy and it often works.  The stock is only artificially held down on ex-day by the exchange itself.  Then the market does what it does and buying and selling determines the price.  You can have full price recovery within that same day.

If it worked how you're saying, then the stock would go to zero after a certain amount of dividends are paid.  The price would just keep falling, unable to breach some artificial ceiling you think exists.  You'd fail the CFA exam pretty miserably with how you're viewing it.

>Dividends are overrated and are basically forced selling of your stock IMO.

It's not forced selling of stock.  You can think they are overrated, which is an opinion of yours, but saying it's forced selling is false.

You can have your own opinion but not your own facts.The fact that OP's comment about theta decay ripping apart LEAP options compared to 3-8 week options... is getting this much upvote worries me.>Not sure why you would recommend short expiries

I think you're responding to the wrong person. I'm not recommending anything.  Might want to double check that.>You're being downvoted because you don't understand how theta decays

I understand how it decays just fine.

>Higher DTE and/or deeper ITM or OTM, the more linear the decay.

But it still decays.  You can't reverse theta decay as you get closer to expiration.  The rate of decay can change but the net decay will still be there.

Downvotes aren't really justified if we're going off of Reddiquette, which says you downvote when a post does not contribute to discussion or is spam.  And if you're going to try and tell me that 6-7 people are all in agreement that I'm wrong about theta decay, in a sub where most people don't even know what a market maker is, well, I just think that's silly.

>There's ways to express long term bearish views in way that nets theta gains over time.

You'd have to use more than 1 contract.  You cannot reverse theta decay or gain theta with a binary position.  And that's not what we're talking about.  We're talking about a single contract.>I understand you're long the underlying and if you sell a put (that means you're long the underlying, right?)

Not necessarily.  You can have a long or short mentality and do any kind of option play you want.  You can believe the price is going down and sell a put because you want to acquire the stock.  All depends on what you're trying to do.

>What if the stock prices drops and the counter party exercises the option (i.e. they force you to buy?)

Then you buy.  You wanted to buy anyways.  Now you buy and you keep the premium you received from writing the option in the first place.

>It's not bad right, since you were long the stock anyways and made $XX in premiums?

You don't have to be "long" on the stock.  Long and short do not always correlate to puts and calls directly.

>Guess you'd need a lot of cash assuming your purchasing 100*X number of contracts.

No, each contract is just 100 shares.  So if I write a single put option at a $50 strike that's only $5,000.

>What does "roll it forward and collect more premium until it does hit" mean? Sorry - I'm a newb.

It means you simultaneously close out your current series and open up a new series later in date at the same or different strike.  Typically you'll receive a credit on the trade as the cost to close out the current position will be less than the premium received for the new position.I don't think it is.  My post is accurate.

Name-calling is uncalled for in any context.Yeah so maybe I wasn't clear.  "Would have"  and "could have" and "if" mean zero to me.  I can do that all day.

What counts is what transpired.  The facts.  Not speculation.  Not theory.  Not hypothetical.

I like seeing plays in real time.  I wish one of these guys who is so sure about this would just make a play, post the filled buy orders, and let's do this.[removed]I'm about to have another one of those "Selling shares is the same thing as receiving a dividend" discussions with some guy who believes that garbage.  I'm 100% sure the guy doesn't know what retained earnings is, doesn't know GAAP, and doesn't know how the market prices securities.  But we'll see.

It's about the 10th discussion on this I've had in 3 months.  I wish I could find the source of this myth so I can put it to bed, but so far I can't.  It's widespread but no one can explain it to me when I ask them to walk me through the retained earnings statement and the stock price calculation and show me how it's "the same thing."It's liquidity.  A broker can internalize the order, meaning it never even hits the market, they fill it on the other side of their book.  The market maker can also fulfill it with their order book and it doesn't even hit the exchange.  Something else in play that is less visible is dark money.  These are orders that sit off the books and that come into play once an order is made to fulfill it.

This is an ethical grey area.  It's legal, but there is a lot of criticism of the off-the-books orders existing invisibly.

And currently the big brokers have no fees.  The Big 3 are Schwab, Fidelity, and TDA.  They all went no-fee.  But there's a difference between stock brokers who have been around for 100 years and silicon valley iPhone apps like M1 and Robinhood who aren't actually brokers, they're just apps.People selling Treasuries causing the price and index to fall.  Or could be tracking error where the ETF got redeemed a lot and wasn't able to track its index.  I didn't look that far into it because I think buying options on Treasury ETFs is a silly idea.  And you can see my comments saying so.

So it's not me right now with hindsight rubbing it in, I said this was a bad idea from the very beginning.>Again, you could have shaved this post to five words, ‚Äúdo your own due diligence‚Äù

Don't read it if you don't like it.  No one has a .38 to your head forcing you to click links.  Skip the content or you can block me.

The topic was deleted, they disappeared, and this is the after-action report.

I don't do options plays on bond ETFs.  That's not how I trade.

>Q.E is on deck for Monday, itl catch a bid again then.

Please post up your trade, hopefully images of your buy tickets, and let's follow along and see how it turns out.> Okay, but still you're looking at it on a weekly timeframe.

Because the original post advocated for calls expiring Aug 7.

How about you read the post before you say stupid shit?>However, they could do that without being disingenuous about the way this particular play worked.

I didn't lay out this play.  The previous OP did.  It's a shame the post is deleted because it was like 7 paragraphs long and went into detail on entry and exit.

>It was a very successful play.

No, it wasn't.  The day to exit was indicated as 8/7.  On 8/7 the options were worthless.  That's a failure.

>If you bought TLT calls today while it was under 170, you're probably in good shape for next week, too. Of course, nothing is certainty and this is still a high risk play.

Any time there are "ifs" and it's a hypothetical scenario, that means it doesn't count.  We go by what happened.  Not what "could have" happened.

That OP said TLT would continue to rise every day.  It didn't.  Saying "Well, he **could have** sold and made money", well, he didn't.  He thought TLT would rise every single day so holding another day would mean more profit.  Then the bottom fell out.> That's right. The previous OP chose the 170 strike, chose the expiration, and chose the strategy to hold until expiry and then profit.

Here is the original post https://imgur.com/a/YPHiGyi

Where does it say that?>No, it wasn't.  The day to exit was indicated as 8/7.  On 8/7 the options were worthless.  That's a failure.

No. Guy. You don't udnerstand options, lol.

NO ONE SAID HOLD TILL EXP.
>The previous OP chose the 170 strike, chose the expiration, and chose the strategy to hold until expiry and then profit.

That's incorrect lmao. That post is deleted, but the title says Fed buying Tues-Thurs. TLT was up at it's tops on both Tuesday and Thursday morning when the fed buying happened. You can watch it when the next fed auction happens Monday morning if you want. (Edit: there was also a fed auction on Wed that was mentioned in that post, but it wasn't buying the long dated bonds that are directly tied to TLT, whereas Tues and Thurs were and they were clearly hits.

I found the deleted post and at no point does that guy say hold to expiry. You're talking out your ass. Maybe he didn't explicitly say, "sell this when it's up and don't hold it to expiry", but you should assume that if you're talking about an options play; it's a lesson a lot of people learn the hard way pretty quickly when they start playing options. And maybe he should have been explicit in his post to say to exit after the fed pump Thursday. But you're still wrong in saying the play was bad.you dont understand my point. my point is debit spreads require a lower change in the underlying for a profit, in exchange for a capped gain and lower defined risk. Its better than a long call in especially things that move sort of sideways like t bills.

it was funny though listening to your rant. lol. I am just 18, what the hell is webvan. sounds like the name of a pyramd scheme[removed]Dude, don't take that. Fight his ass. 

[Here is a fight song for you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saEpqhBP5M)It‚Äôs worse than that though. I mostly did ETFs for years and in the last 12 months I‚Äôve started to buy individual stocks. She put money into her IRA and hit the Easy button. And then she jumped straight to individual stocks. Then dumped it. The stuff I‚Äôm buying I‚Äôm planning on holding for at least the next decade, unless something changes. She‚Äôs just gambling and will one day lose a bunch and maybe then double down to try and make her money back.And like gambling, it's a constant "Well, if I had *only* done **this** I would have won!" always trying to turn back time, and repeat mistakes.  Just draws them in deeper.

Everyone is pointing to this particular trade and saying "Well, **if** he sold earlier, he would have made money!"  Yeah but he's saying TLT is going to rise *every single day consecutively* so selling too early would mean he doesn't realize the entire profit he wants to.  So waiting until the final day, like the original plan, is what you have to look at.  It blew up.

I think what's even harder than walking away when you hit your stop is walking away when you hit your target price with a gain.  Very tempting to keep riding it thinking it will always go up.  Instead of cutting your gain and being good with that.I think this is worse than gambling honestly. I think most people walk into a casino and know the odds are against them. They hope they get lucky and win. With stocks, so many people think they have a sure thing and then it goes sideways and fucks them.[removed]Arbitrage away then if it works. It‚Äôs not a free lunch. You‚Äôre delusional if you think that the dividend comes out of thin air. They affect book value and market value alike. The market value change is just harder to observe through the noise.Agreed, he clearly doesn‚Äôt understand LEAPS.  I regularly use LEAPS for synthetic exposure to stock and even in VIX > 20 land, the negative theta is relatively low.

The play is to day-trade TLT calls. Buy at 169, dump at 171/172.

I feel like you don't really need to know the ins and outs of these to know the difference between keeping your shares and being paid the dividend to boot, and selling them and not getting a dividend. Or am I also misunderstanding something here? Like where do Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or Black Scholes et al have to do with this?A dividend paid is less money in the balance sheet and therefore lowers the valuation. That discussion is just to unspecific though, because when they say its ‚Äûthe same‚Äú they only mean that it does not matter for your yields if the company pays a dividend or not. But they are still different things ofcourse.I don‚Äôt mind dark pools tbh. Every time my order fills and I get a price improvement, I‚Äôm happy. I don‚Äôt care that it‚Äôs ‚Äúdark‚Äù: Citadel, etc saved me some money.I see... I think tracking errors in ETFs might be quite commonplace and an arbitrage opportunity, if there were a mechanism for converting an ETF into its constituent stocks (is there such a thing)?

A report I saw a few weeks ago said that a lot of the ETFs were undervalued during the March sell-offs amid heightened fear and volatility, but I'll have to find it again to read it in more detail.I'm not really into posting my book on the internet, but I'm long Vol, short equities, long bonds. I entered TLT back at 161 back in late May, strike set for Nov. Doing well. I didnt see the original post, but if he set a strike that early it was foolish with the way its been trading. 

I still fully expect interest rates to hit 0. Perhaps negative. But it will take time, based on how its been trading.Relax bud. TLT is a great play on longer timeframes> The day to exit was indicated as 8/7

Here is the original post https://imgur.com/a/YPHiGyi

Where does it say that?You can still view deleted threads/comments: https://www.removeddit.com/r/investing/comments/i38k65/fed_tlt_buys_tuesthurs_guarantee_a_50125_return/In his responses where I was trying to hammer out details from him and trying to get images of his buy orders.  He kept moving his dates and changing his info and I couldn't nail him down on when he purchased.  But he did say that "because TLT will continue to rise every single day until the Fed stops printing money" that he will hold until expiry.  He also said he'll be doing the same thing next week and continue doing it because he "makes thousands every week" doing this trade.>That's incorrect lmao

I made notes specifically because I was going to check.  Look in the comments.  It's pretty clear.

>You can watch it when the next fed auction happens Monday morning if you want.

I think what would be better is if you make a post about your buys, show screenshots of the buy orders, and then I'll set a reminder for your exit timeframe and then you can show us your sell orders.  That'll be a good demonstration for us all and it will save us a **lot** of headache by avoiding all the "what ifs" and "could haves" and all the other speculation.  We can have tangible results right here.  And hey, it's only a week away.

It comes from retained earnings.  Can you walk me through an income statement through to retained earnings?

No, the market value is affected by people and their emotions.  That's why Uber is a stock with a price even when it's a negative P/E.  The book value is utter garbage.  The market value is not.

>The market value change is just harder to observe through the noise.

The market value is the split between the bid and the ask.  It's right on the screen.

You're not able to refute anything I'm saying because it's true.I'm not interested in anything you have to say, if it makes it easier for you.  Not sure how else to say it.  It's like if someone were to ask me if I'd care to look at some cosmetic items like lipstick or nail polish.  I'd say, no, I'm not interested and feel the same way I do about your advice or statements, or whatever it is that you're doing.I'm addressing that one guy who keeps replying to all of my other posts.  He's probably going through something and trying to use my posts as some vehicle to vent or something.  Whatever it is, I hope he gets the help he needs.[removed]>Like where do Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or Black Scholes et al have to do with this?

So GAAP helps you understand what a dividend actually is and how it's paid out.  A lot of people think stocks are priced at book value.  So they think a reduction in assets or a reduction in retained earnings has a 1:1 relationship with the price of the stock.

So their argument is "If you got a $50 dividend, if the company had kept the money, the stock would have risen by $50 because the company has more assets."  This is obviously faulty logic because we know stocks are not priced at book value, they are priced by humans trading on exchanges.

So they say "Just sell shares and then you control when you get the money as opposed to receiving a dividend where the company controls the schedule."  This is more faulty logic.

Black Scholes is how options are priced so that doesn't relate as much in this instance.  Black Scholes is more for the people who claim that "timing of a security doesn't matter."  They are what I call Theta Deniers.Well obviously the upside the being unethical is profit.  But we have laws and ethics to try and curb that behavior.  Some people would do things all day without thinking if there wasn't a penalty attached.Nit pick: dark pools is a term for a type of exchange, not when market makers fill orders before they hit the exchange>if there were a mechanism for converting an ETF into its constituent stocks

The redemption process.I'm not talking about posting your entire account.  Just the executed order.  So whichever broker you use, just find the order history, look for filled orders, and it'll say "Bought 100 shares of X at $50 on 8/7/2020 at 11am" or something.

This shows that you have skin in the game and you're not just making things up.

Then we can look at your actual sell order (not when you look at a chart but when you realize a gain) to see if you made money.  It will say "Sold X number of shares in XYZ for $55 on 8/10/2020" etc.

>I didnt see the original post, but if he set a strike that early it was foolish with the way its been trading.

He claimed that he does weekly trades on the weekly series and he makes money "every single week."  I asked to see some sale tickets and he just told me "have fun being broke" or something to that effect.

>I still fully expect interest rates to hit 0. Perhaps negative.

A lot of the  TIPS are negative currently.  Could definitely happen.> TLT is a great play on longer timeframes

Cool. Completely irrelevant to the post.You're copy pasting the same message in multiple places.  I already answered.  You'll be the newest edition to my block list if you keep copy/pasting spamming me.You're trying to shift the goalposts, because you claimed he advocated holding to expiry in his post, now that's disproven, you're trying to claim it was in the commentsI read all his responses, /u/dramaticdan never said that. You're not only being disingenuous, you're flat out lying out yer arse like it was on fire.Show me the comment where he said to hold calls to expiry. I found the deleted post in your OP. I see you bringing up expiration, but I don't see him suggesting anything about holding til Friday. He posted Monday that his calls were already up 20%, he said it would go up more and it did. "Guarantee 50-125% return" I see those numbers in the chart.

So, basically you're right that holding til expiry would be a bust, but the play was still chicken tenders [because I got automodded lmao] if you bought Monday. Plenty of good exit points.

I bought some TLT calls today, I'll probably unload them next week if you want to see how it works out.

I don't care about your credentials as I have plenty of my own, only your argument. They don't add to your case. The market value being the split between the bid and the ask doesn't invalidate my point. The fact arbitrage opportunities exist doesn't change the fact that both book value and market value take a hit after a dividend.Dude, its a copy/paste of your own words.  

I am not trolling you.  Your original post saying not to put a bunch of money into TLT weeklies is fine.  Your thoughts on theta are misleading at best.This is what you wrote.

>The problem is Theta decay will tear you apart when you have an expiration in 2 years. You pay a lot of premium for that kind of time horizon. All of my options buys have expirations 3-8 weeks out, max. Anything over 2 months and you're paying a lot of money for that timing.

You inplied theta decay for 2years+ options are worse than 3-8 weeks long options.

And the truth is, theta decay is worse for 3-8 week options than 2 year ones.

That's the only point people are trying to get across and you are being difficult with it.

Good post warning noobs about options but you need to learn to say oops when you implied something that is incorrect.You need to learn some self awareness and respect, buddy.>So their argument is "If you got a $50 dividend, if the company had kept the money, the stock would have risen by $50 because the company has more assets."

Oh, I see. That's something a simple Google search ('when is company X paying out dividends') would answer, plus there's a school of thought that the price of a company / the market cap is the sum of all future dividends discounted for the time value of money, or something like that. So definitely not a 1:1.

I mentioned Black Scholes since I wasn't sure what 'how the market prices securities' was referring to, and thought that since this thread was about an option, it would apply here. 

Is retained earnings similar to the concept of float? A wild stab in the dark here, and probably wrong, but I like how you explain things. Thanks for taking the time!How so?Well sorry, but if someone is posting false claims in multiple places, I'll do the same with the refutationI don't understand much of options myself, but that 8/7 is not the exit date, it is when the options expire, which is different.You really don't get it lolIt's not disproven.

|-|-|-|-|>Show me the comment where he said to hold calls to expiry.

I'd have to dig it up and I'm not going to go back and dig up things for you.  It's not my job.

>I found the deleted post in your OP. I see you bringing up expiration, but I don't see him suggesting anything about holding til Friday.

It was commented on several times as I was trying to nail down some solid answers as to the price action.

>He posted Monday that his calls were already up 20%, he said it would go up more and it did. "Guarantee 50-125% return" I see those numbers in the chart.

You can see all kinds of return on a chart.  Do you see any sell tickets with dollars on them?  Because depending on when he bought and when he sold, that will mean what profit was made.  Not drawing imaginary lines and circles yourself.

>So, basically you're right that holding til expiry would be a bust, but the play was still chicken tenders [because I got automodded lmao] if you bought Monday. Plenty of good exit points.

Doesn't mean he took any of the exit points.  His theory was that TLT would rise every single day and continue to rise.  What makes you think he cut the rise short by a day and got out at just the right time?  Why is that more likely than him holding on as long as he can and busting out?

>I bought some TLT calls today, I'll probably unload them next week if you want to see how it works out. RemindMe! 7days

It defines market value correctly.  Your statement about market value being affected "alike" with dividends is incorrect.

>The fact arbitrage opportunities exist doesn't change the fact that both book value and market value take a hit after a dividend.

The market value is adjusted downward on ex-day at the open by the exchange.  Then when the market opens it is allowed to trade at any range the market tolerates without the SEC or the exchange stepping in to halt trading.

Your statement about the dividend "coming out of the stock's value" is false.  That's not how it works.  Claiming it to be a "zero net gain" is false.  That's not how it works.  That's not how GAAP works. It's not how the exchanges work. It's not how price discovery works.  You're just flat out wrong.  You heard something somewhere, it sounded good to you, and you're going with it.  This is not taught anywhere because it's incorrect and you'd fail CFA Level 1 for thinking that this is how securities are priced.

I don't mind different opinions, but you're wrong about the facts.  I'm afraid you don't know what you're talking about.  There's not a nicer way to say it because you're just wrong.

No, I didn't imply that.  You're trying to change what I said to make me say that.  But I didn't.  I'm not responsible for your imagination.  I know what I said and what I didn't say.

>And the truth is, theta decay is worse for 3-8 week options than 2 year ones.

Worse per time period, yes.  But the overall decay just goes down to zero eventually.  I've never claimed otherwise.

Why would they need to "get across" that point?  It's not been disputed.  I never said it.

You'd think so.  But these arguments go on and on and on and then I'm asked to "cite" GAAP.  Like how the hell do I cite basic accounting procedure?  I'm sure it's in the FASB somewhere but holy shit man.

>I mentioned Black Scholes since I wasn't sure what 'how the market prices securities' was referring to, and thought that since this thread was about an option, it would apply here.

Just how stocks are not book value.  The difference between book value and market value.  I keep telling them if it was book value then Uber wouldn't exist because they have a negative P/E.  But they still don't get it.

>Is retained earnings similar to the concept of float?

Retained earnings is the income made by a company minus dividends paid out to shareholders.  That's all it is.  Earnings retained by the company.  The higher dividend you pay out, the lower ending retained earnings is.

There are new mechanisms in the tax code with the TCJA that penalize the accumulation of money by corporations without investing it or paying it out.  Like the accumulated earnings tax etc but they don't need to dive that deep to know that dividends are a good thing.> Because the original post advocated for calls expiring Aug 7.We know the options have expired worthless, they always do! 

You said he advocated holding to expiry but in fact he only stipulated the entry point and was non-specific about the exit

Which is a massive flaw in any trading stategy I would agree, but it is not what you claim. I agree with a previous commentor, you are being disingenuous about how this strategy failedWell I went and made a chart for the option you're crying about and demonstrated it was highly profitable in the past week, and I went and dug up the deleted post in question to check your claim that he pushed holding it til expiration and found nothing. And your ass is too lazy to back up the latter claim. Burden of proof and all that.

I got 2k on 8/21 calls at 170.5 and 171. Maybe I'll take a screenshot over the weekend for fun, if I'm feeling cute.Lol I gave you overall screenshot right before I sold and then sold logs. You're so bitter you can't put the two together.

I think it was Buffett, but I might be wrong - the idea that only companies that have already reached the point of efficiently using their capital and still have excess should have dividends - do you think it's a flawed idea, and do these changes in the tax code mean this mentality won't be allowed anymore? Or I suppose efficiently using it might be reinvesting it...but companies might also want to keep some cash on hand in case of attractive M&A opportunities instead of doing an all-stock purchase (which normally leads to a decline in the purchaser's share price if I'm not mistaken). I'll go look at the TCJA in more detail later, but if you know off the top of your head, do tell.If Uber would just start to pay dividends though its valuation still would go down because of it. its not valued only on book value, but book value will still have some effect. uber is worth less than uber with 50$ cashOK but that was dumb lol[removed]>the option you're crying about

Crying?  Lol ok.

>Maybe I'll take a screenshot over the weekend for fun, if I'm feeling cute.

Well tag me when you do.  Until then, I'm not going to take it seriously or consider it as something in reality.  It'll just be another price-volume chart with some circles drawn on past inflection points.

Or I could make another one of these posts when your trades bust but I think people get the idea.That's right. No balls to show the actual buy transactions. You know, to show how much it cost. They're in the log just like the sells.

So you either made so little you're embarrassed. Or you lost. Case closed.

You keep arguing a point I don't care. I never said you had to hold. I just said you haven't shown you actually made money on it. And you've yet to prove it so guess I'm right. BOLAlright so let's find the key elements that support what I'm saying and strike down your argument.  Ready?  Here we go:

>In general, the increase is about equal to the amount of the dividend, **but** the actual price change is *based on market activity and not determined by any governing entity*.

So right there you'll see the **market** dictates the price.  It's not set in stone anywhere and there are no rules, except for on ex-day which I'll get to.  Got it?  Strike 1.  Let's continue:

>On the ex-date, investors **may** drive down the stock price by the amount of the dividend to account for the fact that new investors are not eligible to receive dividends and are therefore unwilling to pay a premium.Ôªø 

Alright so right there it shows that they **might** pay less and drive down the value but again, it's not set in stone.  So this is strike 2 against you.  It invalidates you claiming that it's a "zero net gain" because that would require it to always be true.  It isn't.

Let's continue:


>**However**, if the market is particularly optimistic about the stock leading up to the ex-dividend date, the price increase this creates may be larger than the actual dividend amount, **resulting in a net increase** despite the automatic reduction.

That's strike 3.  That basically says that despite the automatic reduction by the exchange, the **market** dictates the price and it might not get reduced **at all**.

Time for the Bonus Round.  Ready?  This is the right cross the knocks you on the mat:

>Many people invest in certain stocks at certain times **solely to collect dividend payments**. Some investors purchase shares just before the ex-dividend date and then sell them again right after the date of record‚Äî*a tactic that can result in a tidy profit if it is done correctly*.

Boom!  Cold.  Your own link backed up what I said *exactly* and it invalidated all your claims.

You're lying on the mat unconscious.  You got slaughtered.  You're done.Did you give up on getting any lucid discussion out of him on your point of disagreement?

Further down the thread he's accusing you of saying writing and buying is the same thing like lmaoFlexibility.  I like shorter time horizons so I can adjust.  I'll usually write the puts with 21-30 days until expiration.  If I feel like it I'll write new ones, if not or if I need the capital elsewhere, I can do so.You're taking two different posts I made.  One of them said what you just quoted, which, if you think 8 weeks is a "short time horizon" for options then I don't know what to tell you.  The guy above is talking about weekly options series.  Not options 2 months out.

The other post is me **selling** weeklies as a limit order.

Two different mechanisms, two different trades.

So yeah, they're my "literal words" if you take every single thing I write which applies to many different kinds of trades, commingle them together, and then act like it's all talking about the same thing.

But we know that's just intellectual dishonesty don't we?You came up empty huh?  Ouch.  Attention-to-detail will get you every time if you're not careful.  Better luck next time.>So a company like Amazon, which is known for consistently reinvesting in R&D and similar, and afaik don't have dividends - would all of their earnings be considered retained earnings?

Investments in R&D wouldn't make it to retained earnings because it would be already accounted for.  Retained earnings is after everything is paid for and accrued.

>do these changes in the tax code mean this mentality won't be allowed anymore?

The changes in the code definitely motivate companies to not just sit on capital like they did in 2008.  Back then the Fed pumped a ton of liquidity into banks with the expectation that the banks would extend credit and get the economy going.  Instead, they just sat on the cash, did share buybacks, paid bonuses, and traded derivatives in Hong Kong.  They didn't actually add anything to the US economy.

>Or I suppose efficiently using it might be reinvesting it...but companies might also want to keep some cash on hand in case of attractive M&A opportunities instead of doing an all-stock purchase (which normally leads to a decline in the purchaser's share price if I'm not mistaken)

You're allowed to accumulate up to $250,000 annual before getting hit with that tax.  If you have money being allocated for a specific purpose like a merger, it will be exempted from the tax.  And most of the time a merger will be financed.  Companies don't typically just save up cash for that "maybe one day" event of a buyout.  They get favorable financing on the merger if the same bank extending the credit is part of the syndicate underwriting the purchase.Yeah, it was dumb. Saying it was dumb is the point of OP's post. Which you would know, if you read it.[removed]I'm really confused as to what you think +90% and change overall means.Here https://imgur.com/a/3b58Rvb

Tell me what "total returns" means because it seems like you know what that means and I don't.

Edit: it's very easy to put two and two together my stubborn childNo all you managed to to prove is that market price action caused by sentiment can occur simultaneously with price action caused by the dividend. Sometimes this price action can cancel out the drop. Other times like in the case of MSFT in 2004 the price action caused by the dividend is visible through and overshadows the noise of price action due to sentiment. I never set anything was set in stone. I also never claimed that the move in stock price was solely due to the drop from the dividend. There can be multiple causes for price action and you can only observe the net effect.It's fine.  The irony is theta decay is what blew up the original trade OP recommended against.  Oh well."The problem is Theta decay will tear you apart when you have an expiration in 2 years. You pay a lot of premium for that kind of time horizon. All of my options buys have expirations 3-8 weeks out, max."

Why are you worried about theta decay for an option 2 years out? It doesn't decay hardly at all for most of that 2 years. If it moves closer to the money in that time, you're ahead of the game. And if you're worried about theta decay, you should be extra worried about buying expirations 3-8 weeks out.

Post more in WSB it'll be funny.8 weeks is a short time frame. Plenty to swing trade but you're still dealing with considerably high theta. Most options a year+ out have 00x theta which stays pretty constant unless they start to move ITM and even then you're only hitting 01-05 theta. I got ITM 2021s with only a 06 theta. No-one holds to expiration buy low sell high always be taking profit. Don't confuse people here they will lose money.I just decided not to engage in your conversation because I realized what type of person you are.

When somebody denies a quote they said themselves... it's a big red flag signaling waste of time and it seems like I was right reading your degrading comment.

Thanks for proving my point and wish you the best.Great discourse, man[removed]All I said was I wanted to see your actual buy transactions, not the chart. Why you make that so difficult, I don't know.

In particular, the extra 5 that are on your chart and not listed in your sells.>No all you managed to to prove is that market price action caused by sentiment can occur simultaneously with price action caused by the dividend.

Yes, it **can**.  Anything **can** happen, including the company going bankrupt.  But that's not the discussion.  You're asserting that the dividend is a "zero net gain" because it "takes away from the stock price."  We know that's not true.  Your own source even said sometimes there is no decrease in price **at all**.

>Sometimes this price action can cancel out the drop

This contradicts your earlier statement.  Because when I said it you said I was wrong.  I illustrated how the exchange can reduce the price on ex-day and then the market takes over.  That's exactly what your link says as well.

So your argument is finished.  You're done.  You were wrong.  Not just a little wrong.  Dead wrong.

>Other times like in the case of MSFT in 2004 the price action caused by the dividend is visible through and overshadows the noise of price action due to sentiment.

Sure, it can happen.  But it's not a rule and you can't use a 2004 dividend to substantiate that "dividends are a net zero gain."

You also said that you *can't* buy on ex-day and then sell and make a profit.  Your link said that's bullshit, that you can do this and you can "make a tidy profit" as well.

So pretty much everything you said was wrong.  It's interesting that the one source you provided proved everything you said wrong.  It's like you put the gun in your own mouth and pulled the trigger without me doing anything.

You're toast.>8 weeks is a short time frame.

>Don't confuse people here they will lose money.

People here are confused already and will lose money as soon as the tech stocks go against them.  I'm not advocating or advising people to do anything.  Mainly because I don't care.

I'm not into tying up funds until 2021.  I'm in and out of positions faster.  I don't see the value in holding an option that long.  If it's a year out then I will either acquire the security somehow at that point or I'll revisit it later.  Everyone has their own style.

That's complete and utter bullshit.  Of course it's an opportunity.  And yes, it works.

>I just said that there are multiple sources of price action.

You said that dividends are a "net zero gain."  That's incorrect.  You're flat out wrong.  You don't know how the markets work, you don't know how accounting works, you lack basic GAAP knowledge, and I think you lack trading experience.Cool?  I guess?  I trade weekly but it's tiring to sit here and give rundowns of every single trade I make and what I bought at and what I sold at etc.  Because it doesn't matter.

I have my own style and I stick to it.  I don't really adopt someone else's style because it's just not how I do things.  Our accounts are not tied and my trades don't affect you.  So you're in the clear and you shouldn't worry about it, honestly.

Nothing I've said is incorrect or false in any way.https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/stocks/why-dividends-matter "The bottom line

Commissions are $0 now.  Taxes are not 100%.  Saying it's "not easy" and saying it's "not possible" are not the same thing.  This doesn't help your point or validate any of your statements.

>Even Fidelity agrees with me.

Uhh... no they don't.  Look again at what you wrote.  I quoted it.  You said it's a "net zero gain."  That's false.

Yet you don't know how retained earnings works and you don't know dividend mechanics?  Must have gotten very lucky because you would fail any accounting curriculum and fail even the most basic CFA test.  You definitely wouldn't make it to being a CPA either.

>anyone can cram enough knowledge to pass.

Uhh... the CFA has like a 20% pass rate.  CPA has like a 50% pass rate on the exams.  You need years of accounting course work before you are even allowed to sit for the exams.  You need a full 12 months of hands-on experience to even get a non-attest license.  If you're able to "cram" years of schooling and years of experience, then you probably actually know the material.  That's like saying you can "cram" to be MD or to be an attorney.  It's a silly statement.  It's ignorant as well.>To each his own, of course.

>Its just not fair to people that might not be as knowledgeable as we are to stumble upon "theta will tear you apart when you have an expiration in 2 years."

It's not a false statement.  Theta will tear you apart if you have no price movement.  It will chip away at the value of your contract.  Like I said, nothing I've said is inaccurate or false.  At all.  You would have already jumped on it.  But it's not there.

Cool, that's a separate topic and I really don't care to be frank.Frankly I'm not sure how the article could be any clearer " A stock price adjusts downward when a dividend is paid. The adjustment may not be easily observed amidst the daily price fluctuations of a typical stock, but the adjustment does happen. This adjustment is much more obvious when a company pays a "special dividend" (also known as a one-time dividend). When a company pays a special dividend to its shareholders, the stock price is immediately reduced.¬†"Just because it's possible doesn't mean your expected value is significant or positive. Just as you can walk into a casino, play roulette and walk out with more money than you came in with, it's possible to come out ahead with dividend capture strategies while having no expected value from your strategy.  CFA does not require any advanced math, definitely not any differential equations required for understanding derivatives at any significant level.

You'd fail the tests anyways.  And to even sit for the CPA exams you need quite a few credits in accounting subjects which you don't have.

No one has "memorized" the material on the CPA exam and not understood the material.  You're making that up to substantiate your shaky position.

1. Cold start time is measured in latency. 5G will bring increased bandwidth, but CDN and latency have nothing to do with the switch to 5G. 5G will increase the demand for Edge computing as the number of devices processing at the edge increases. CDN is simply a cache of static data near customers, 5G will not require faster CDN speeds at all. You‚Äôre incredibly far off on this. I can give more details but I don‚Äôt really see if it‚Äôs necessary.

2. Again, fastly is a CDN. Reddit is not being charged while you write this essay. Reddit gets charged when fastly delivers images/videos/(maybe text) from their CDN servers to customers. So when you click a link fastlys CDN will send the data. Depending on the amount of data served, reddit will be charged. Your essay has no bearing on how much reddit is being charged in any way shape or form. But clicks on this link (might) go through fastly. I doubt it but it‚Äôs easy to find out.

Cloudflare and fastly are different companies with different offerings and target markets. They‚Äôre barely comparable. The only thing they have in common is that they are both fantastic companies with fantastically high valuations.

Either way, I work in cloud computing and am typing this from my phone as I move boxes. If people are interested I can elaborate on these points later.

Both are great investments long term. Both may be overvalued short term. These two companies make up a massive percentage of my portfolio.Why wont tiktok move to azure if msft bought it?It‚Äôs concerning that their enterprise clients only increased by 6 YOY during a time when you would think CDN is extremely useful.

I don‚Äôt understand CDN well enough to make a clear judgement but it seems odd. It feels like they‚Äôre being slowly edged out by other people.&#x200B;

>Thus, while I am spending 5-10 mins to write this essay, Reddit is getting charged by Fastly (pun intended!). 

Reddit gets charged once.  The length of time it takes you to write this post has zero impact.

>Imagine if I had to spend several 100 microseconds for a webpage to open, I would be pissed and may not go on that website, purely because of that reason.

That would suck... there's basically no mainstream CDNs that are that slow.  Not sure why you included this at all.You know the problem retail investors have with being a Fsly long ? We don‚Äôt  really know what we are investing in. Unless you are a cloud developer or have used multiple CDNs, you have to rely on YouTube , their conference calls, and basic articles to piece it together. 

If you listen to the conference call, even the analysts don‚Äôt even know. Questions like ‚Äúhow does your tech differ from the competitors?‚Äù or ‚Äú Can you give some example use cases for your compute@edge beta?‚Äù

And these dudes cover the industry. This is their god damn job. And they don‚Äôt even know what makes Fsly different from other CDNs. Why Fsly is positioned to dominate the IoT, Mobile first and live streaming future. (All my assumptions ). 

If I can ask the executives for one thing...Please make your company less opaque to investors, Wall Street , and potential customers. I get that you are a ‚ÄúMade by Developers for Developers‚Äù but for fuck sake, some of us stakeholders need clarity.I may buy more, I‚Äôm sure Fastly will have good future - never had doubts. 

Also....fuck Trump.You convinced me.  Will be selling an aggressive cash secured put with every intention of taking possession if the stock does fall to the $70 level by 8/21I sold for a 50% profit but I will buy back in when it hits my number.  I felt it moved up to fast the last couple of weeks.  The fact that earnings were coming up I knew that fastly was going to beat earnings expectations however with the run up it seemed liked a bigger gamble than I wanted to take.  So with that said I think it‚Äôs a great company and it will do big things so I took profits hoping to add to my position on the drop.    Also like many others I like NET so I was in Both.  Still holding NETüëçWhich is better buy right now in your mind: Fastly or NET? I currently hold NET but not any Fastly. Someone made a post here saying NET is better positioned to win in the long-term than Fastly. The person said Fastly will continue to grow in the immediate future but will lose to NET in the long term.Thank you. You said they‚Äôre the best CDN provider- what makes you think they‚Äôd still be the best in the next couple of years? Do they have contracts with their big clients such as Shopify & Amazon? Could amazon potentially build their own CDN (sorry I‚Äôm not too familiar with the industry- forgive me if these questions are dumb)? Could Amazon switch to NET or other competitors next year for a better price/service? 

In essence, I guess my question is what makes their product the best and irreplaceable for the foreseeable future? 

I really appreciate your write up!Thank you but no thank you

NET is the only proper and currently still undervalued cdnOP you do not understand fastly or net. 

1. NET is the fastest cold start. It's 0 seconds. That happened a month ago


2. Fastly grew because it already had video architecture 

3. NET did not, until June. It's an incredibly impressive technology.


4. Fastly price model is not unique. It's metered. Great for small startups and college kids but terrible for large enterprises that want to cut costs long term

5. NETs pricing model is unique.

6. NET is compliance based. That is far more important in cloud. Your focus on speed is one of the least important things in cloud computing right now.

7. NET isn't a CDN. It's a distributed private network. And it's a serverless computing platform.Do you feel NET is overhyped?Why can't/ wouldn't AWS, azure or GCP with there big pocket and engineering resources just beat fastly cold star time? Economic moat of fastly is thin. Also Why wouldn't MSFT use azure CDN instead once they acquire it?Bought some yesterday...will keep them for a whileNice write up. 

Just curious - how long are you holding SQ for? I‚Äôm up about 30% right now. (Shares not options.)I see a ton of Fastly vs NET comparisons. Are they direct competitors? Is the market for edge computing large enough for both to thrive?How do we value these companies.  What is the best metric?5G and CDNs are connected by a very thin string. That's just not how Internet connections work.

Charging by the byte also prices out customers. For example, would a streaming service like Netflix or Peacock want to use Fastly? Probably not. If it takes a few extra seconds to buffer an hour long movie, they can add a quick animation for that. If they have to pay for the gigs you've streamed vs a monthly fee, they're likely to choose a monthly fee.Good write up, OP. I got in on FSLY @ $20.98 and have absolutely no desire to sell.Wayfair is not doing well.This is the dumbest post I've seen, all your points are dumbNice DD, all this reminds me of when Lekezen2 was jacked to the tits with $1 mil worth of FSLY at $22, and every other person on WSB was saying he's going to be broke in 6 months. Looks who's laughing now.

FYI the more I read about this company, the more I like it. In also jacked to the tits with shares.!remindme 10 hoursGreat time to buy in now! Already long in $NET but this will be a nice position for my portfolio as wellJust buy WCLD and own the sectorHello knowledgeable cloud dude

Can you please give your opinion of compute@edge. Is this Fsly software going to change the paradigm for edge computing? It‚Äôs currently in beta and Arthur seems excited for it to roll out in 2021.Any recs on stocks I should be looking at? I was in fsly, net, and ddog all before covid and tbh I have no idea why I got in them. I think it was fsly IPO mixed with the story of ddog management team telling a company like csco or someone to pound sand when they got an offer sheet that was shite. 

Anyway, I'd be interested in the plays you think are interesting. They don't even have to be tech. I mean if you said $KO I'd say look at their chart the last month and it's not that bad of a call.I am sure that you are very knowledgeable but I would like to point out something that's incorrect.

>CDN is simply a cache of static data near customers

CDN is Content Delivery Network, which is a geographically distributed network of servers/data centers around the world. The cache of static data near customers is a way to optimize the performance to ensure that large volume of traffic won't jam up the data centers across the world.

>5G will not require faster CDN speeds at all.

5G will definitely indirectly affect CDNs. The increased amount of network traffic generated by 5G will require faster CDN or more data centers around the world to handle the traffic flow.

>I can give more details but I don‚Äôt really see if it‚Äôs necessary.

Please do share more details if I am wrong.I like your response and would be interested to know the stocks you own especially cuz I agree with everything you said. I work for a company that uses Akamai and I have a good understanding of CDN so I could understand what yiu were getting at. Keep up the good contribution you do here![deleted]I would love to hear your thoughts on limelight networks (LLNW). Excited for a smaller cap CDN with high profile clients, and after the earnings call the emphasis they put on developing edge computing seems promising.As a developer. Thank you for typing out this. 80% of people on here barely seems to know what a CDN is even.I can continue to discuss this forever but I will give you 2 strong reasons-

1. Github is still hosted on Fastly. Github was acquired by MSFT 2 years ago. Moving a CDN requires a lot of infrastructure spending. If MSFT did not do this for Github 2 years ago, hard for me to think they will do it for Tiktok.
2. Tiktok needs low cold start time, much like Youtube. That is part of the feature for the videos to load and play as soon as they do. Azure is not equipped to handle that at least as of this writing. MSFT is not interested in moving CDN; that is penny wise and dollar foolish move for them. They have a larger plan for this acquisition, which I am not aware of.

Also added the following section to the write up above-

&#x200B;

**EDIT 2: Here is why MSFT will not care about moving Tiktok to Azure**

I was trying to avoid doing this but here is a little math for those of you who care about it.

From Fastly's 10Q and shareholder letter published on August 7

* Revenue for Q2, 2020 = $74.66MM
* Revenue for Q1, 2020= $82.92MM
* Revenue guidance from the chief: $290-300MM for FY2020
* Tiktok's contribution to this revenue: 12% of $300MM = $36MM

Now, think about this #---> $36MM is what MSFT would have to pay Fastly if they are going to continue using them this year. Of course this number will get compounded every year with the Tiktok's growth.

Are you really convinced that a $1.6T market cap behemoth is interested in saving $36MM per year for an acquisition that they will be paying north of $60-65BB to Bytedance? I mean, really? This is a drop in the bucket for MSFT. Trust me on this. Tech spends more than that much money on free food for employees. If they were really thinking about cutting costs, you would have observed it from their other practices. I will not go any further than this statement.

Again, this is my perspective. You can believe what you want to, but I tried to give you a well documented reason behind why MSFT will not pursue Azure for Tiktok.What do you prefer, buying 1 iPhone 11 or 6-Huawei Chinese made phones?

Point is, if 6 can get them the revenue of 100, they do not need 100. Shopify itself can give them revenue equivalent to several 100 SMBs.Fuck you!It dropped >30% from ATH.... What price are you expecting it to drop from here?I have 70/20/10  percentage wise on Fastly/Net/LLNW.  I am bullish on the sector as a whole but Net is the one that is poised to gain the most in long term, like in coming 5 years.Both are good. They don't even overlap completely. Fastly is overvalued compared to NET. Only issue is can the biggies MSFT and AMZN eat their revenues in future.Both are great! Own them both. I like Fastly better purely because of the large enterprises that they support.I would buy Fastly but I am biased. NET is great as well but I like Fastly's business model better. I think Fastly returns on capital will be a lot more in the future.Its underhyped actually. Given the potential and its huge portfolio of tech it has tremendous potential to become default goto for web security, cdn and edge computing.This logic is flawed. 

Infinite resources and engineers =/= better product. 

If having more money and engineers resulted in better products than the following would be true ....

1) Intc would be crushing amd, tsmc and arm

2) V and MA would have launch apps to crush SQ 

3) ford and GM would be crushing Tsla with better EVs 

4) yahoo would have crushed google when it started out. 

5) Msft would have crushed aapl in mobile phones. Zoom in video conferencing. Goog in search 

6) FB would have crushed Tiktok with a new app

Should I continue ?They will absolutely use azure to cut down their expenses and also to prove that their technology is on par with FSLY. But it's not gonna happen right away, will probably take a year or so. So, short term, FSLY won't loose Tiktok as a client but in the long term FSLY will acquire more enterprises. The real challenge to FSLY is not whether it will loose TikTok to Azure, its whether they can compete with NET given NET has a whole package that focuses not just on CDN but also on cloud computing.If you can tell me why Zoom is the most preferred and popular video chat platform, while Google Hangout, Microsoft Skype and Yahoo Chat existed for 2 decades, I will answer your question.

&#x200B;

**Hint to make you think hard about this**\--Zoom has the best features and best and what they do! Does that ring a bell?Let winners run and cut loosers. SQ has momentum right now. You know the answer already. I have shares too.FSLY is not suitable for Netflix or Disney+. NET is better suited due to their subscription model.Too expensive for me. I can basically pick between FSLY, NET and LLNW.Again, noob mistake if you ask me. It is equally weighed ETF and for this to outperform the market, all the constituents would have to have solid growth. Based on what we saw with earnings, anything subpar is getting punished and this is happening to 4 out of 5 stocks (hell Twilio got hammered). This ETF may not continue to outperform others in the future in my opinion.It's the future but everyone is doing it, cloudflare, azure, akamaiHonestly, I don‚Äôt know enough about compute@edge to really comment. That being said, fastly has great engineers and I‚Äôm sure this offering will be great. The edge computing market is going to be huge and full of many players. Likely, fastly already has great edge infrastructure that they use internally for their CDN.

I‚Äôll read more on thisCloudflare is great long term, they have many products and power tens of millions of websitesThanks for responding.

Honestly, I think 5G will have little to no effect on CDNs. 5G will lead to massive upgrades to the internet backbone to handle more traffic. Better internet infrastructure could imply less need for CDNs, if the whole internet gets faster, we may not need to cache near the edge to improve speeds. 

I don‚Äôt fully see it, but that‚Äôs one thing I could totally be wrong about. Overall, CDN, networking, Edge, 5G are all going to get huge anyways. They‚Äôre all great markets to be investing in. CDNs don‚Äôt need 5G to continue growing at a massive rate because they‚Äôre only going to get more widespread. I don‚Äôt think 5G itself will affect CDNs, but like everything else is lol. CDN is probably the best thing to happen to the internet in the last 10 yearsWhat other companies do you own that have a high TAM and CAGR.  I too own SE and LVGO. Curious what you are going to do with your LVGO shares.TikTok isn't Github. Do you know how many companies use github and need it to be available 24/7? TikTok is going through a lot of security issues and from a security perspective it only makes sense for all the infrastructure to be on Microsoft Azure, especially CDN.Your technical knowledge is so bad lol.

‚ÄúGitHub is hosted on fastly‚Äù 

NaHuh? But across the same tier of products Apple still sells way more phones. 

Also a niche business doesn‚Äôt become a $100B business. It has to appeal to everyone. So it has to sell to everyone and then it has sell to everyone for a lot.I got in at 75 in June I think so I am going to keep watching it and see where it goes.  There is always a chance it goes beyond that however it stayed in the 70-80 for a month or so.What is this store on LLNW. It tanked a lot after results. It is struggling to raise capital.I wouldn't add LLNW. Stick with Fastly and NET. They are disruptors. Like keeping Paypal and SQ.>I will leave you with this food for thought. Elon Musk is not going to build a tire factory for his Teslas purely because it would be cheaper for him to do it. He will continue to rely on Michelin who knows it better than anyone. This ensures that the overall product is good. The moment MSFT shifts Tiktok to Azure for cutting costs, that will be a very expensive move for them because Azure is not built for handling Tiktok as it is right now. As someone mentioned, kids get annoyed if videos take seconds to load. If AWS can move to Fastly and not use their very own Cloudfront because they know the limitations, I am highly convinced that MSFT is not moving  Tiktok to Azure.I know. I said that.fastly is 5% and net is 2% how is it equally weighted?Hmmm...An analogy of what you are saying about 5G is cpu/gpu generations. You assume the hardware/speed improves but the content stays the same. Flawed logic. 

The faster the hardware, the higher resolution the game developers create. No one predicted 4K gaming. If game developers would just stick to 720P, there would be no need for faster chips. Why won‚Äôt they just do that?!!! Because that‚Äôs not how things work. 

5G will result in content developers creating 4K/8k content. iPhones will take 20mb selfies. Why? Because 5G so why not. More and more shit begets more and more shit. Thus the inevitable need for CDNs. There will always be a need for efficiency.We will always need the cache. Transferring data over backbones costs money and they are still not fast, nor wide. 
5G itself will not affect it, but what developers choose to do with it will. It all depends on when the up the resolution, increase interactivity - more calls back and forth...Frenchiie.  You r in every Fsly thread shitting on the company. What gives? 

I have 3 theories....

1) they turned you down for a position

2) you own net and somehow think there can only be one winner

3) you are deep in puts. Which doesn‚Äôt make much sense since you should already be winning. Maybe you buy OTM puts when it was at 75?>For security issue, it needs to be owned and overseen by an established American corporation which does not use or disclose the data of their users. I don't even know what are you talking about.

>  
>2) Pretty sure, users want TikTok to be up 24/7.

>3) Even if MSFT wants to change, it will take time.Which is why I‚Äôm personally more bullish on net haha. Fastly is a fantastic product and I am confident they will continue to see fantastic growth over the years to come, but for the same reasons you mentioned I believe net will perform better.ASML is a $150B business and all they make is a $120M extreme ultraviolet lithography machine.Yeah they are definitely riskier hence I have only abt 10%. I'll do rebalancing to add or remove as time goes on.I don't think you got the whole picture tech wise. Azure and cdn tech don't  compare with Tesla and tyre factory. Azure absolutely can add CDN tech and will be cheaper for MSFT, and it gives them the tremendous advantages in every aspect, why do you think apple is moving towards self designed ARM chip?
Also give Microsoft and Amazon a year, they will come up with similar if not better tech than FSLY. Now this doesn't mean Fsly will disappear, but it make it harder for them to survive especially if they only stick to CDN and not expand to edge computing.Here, if you want to read. 

[https://www.etftrends.com/etf-of-the-week-wisdomtree-cloud-computing-etf-wcld/](https://www.etftrends.com/etf-of-the-week-wisdomtree-cloud-computing-etf-wcld/)That‚Äôs a good point I didn‚Äôt consider. 5g means larger images/videos/files in general because people feel more comfortable sending that type of stuff over the network. Bigger things to load over the network means more need for CDN. That‚Äôs something I never considered. I totally see what you mean.

Looking forward it‚Äôs all about edge computing. The whole internet is trending towards it.Excellent point on the need for larger pipelines.Not to say, best thing about 5G is latency, not bandwidthHere's another theory. The most vicious bears on specific stocks are those who held it for a while and then lost patience and sold it right before its epic run. Those tend to be the saltiest ü§£.1) no

2) no

3) no

You'll see next year when Fastly takes a shit back to $20.Azure CDN is superior to Cloudfront.You are making assumptions that fastly is better than aws cloudfront based on just one metric.

Fastly is a better product when it comes to serving the website to end points faster, which is what amazon.com needs.

But for a lot of AWS customers, the easier integration of AWS cloudfront + other AWS products is a big selling point to them.1) I never said that. I'm saying it doesn't matter what the security issue is. To regain trust it makes the most sense to use Microsofts infrastructure.

2) Yeah but the impact to other businesses and potential lawsuits from having github servers down is higher than tik tok users not being able to access the app.

3) Never said otherwise.I think this net vs Fsly is missing the point. Both are next gen CDNs and edge computing services. 

The analogy is AMD vs INTC. 

Akamai (INTC)has thousands of enterprise customers. Net and Fsly should be able to carve up that pie and take marketshare away from the established CDNs...if their tech is really next gen and best for the mobile, low latency, live streaming world we are in.True, but they have a moat of superior technology and less competition.Agree with everything except Amazon and Microsoft developing a better tech. There is no guarantee for it.Take a look at this link to see who are Azure CDN's customers. Pretty laughable IMO

https://www.featuredcustomers.com/vendor/microsoft-azure-cdn/customersCan you expand a bit more on edge computing? It sounds like it‚Äôs CDN-like but instead of a cloud the functions are performed on device or on a close by edge server. 

If I‚Äôm correct in my understanding - what‚Äôs the difference between cloud and edge server? 

Also, do you have any recommendation stocks? I see Fastly and Cloudfare (and someone below recommended limelight networks) but curious to your thoughts since you seen well versed in this area.Can I just say that I really appreciate the conversations going down here. They're very in depth and so interesting to read. This is what makes this sub great.So much anger without a dog in the race. I don‚Äôt believe you.!remindme 1 yearPlease, I'll be selling you those $20-$60 puts, lol>Lol how are you forming that opinion?  Look up the link I pasted in the original write up and then come back later.   
>  
>  
>  
>You basically bought shit load of puts that you are trying to avoid selling for a loss/Look, Github was a $7.5B aquisiotn and Tiktok is going to be north of $60B. If MSFT was going to cut costs, they could have done it with Github 2 years ago.  Have you ever worked with leadership teams to understand how they think? They are interested in bigger picture. 

Check my update # 2 in original post on why Microsoft will not move Tiktok to Azure.1. No. 99% of people don't even know fastly exists. They will see it is now owned by msft. Security issue done.

2. Kids do not want to wait for videos to load, it's frustrating and annoying. If tiktok is slow they will move on. Tiktoks entire business model crashes if its annoying and not fun.He is such a Fastly bear for no reason, it‚Äôs insane. It‚Äôs like the CEO fucked his wife or somethingThere is a 1 hour delay fetching comments.

|-|-|-|-|no no, try 6 months.I'm actually 100% cash because the risk/reward isn't there for me.I am not saying Microsoft will move TikTok to Azure, moving infrastructure is a time consuming decision, and engineers have shit tons of features/bugs to work on every single day.

> AWS prefers Fastly and not Amazon's very own Cloudfront. Do you know  why? Because Fastly is better than Cloudfront and Amazon has the balls  to admit it. 

You claimed that Fastly is superior product than AWS Cloudfront because of how fast it is. But speed is not the only metrics when it comes to business/technical decisions.

>Have you ever worked with leadership teams to understand how they think? They are interested in bigger picture.  

Well, if you could get your site running on AWS Cloudfront, and it's able to serve millions of users everyday without any problems. Do you think the leadership teams actually care how you do it?Wrong. You're probably in denial because you invested in Fastly lmao. Enjoy your shares going back to $20.Yeah. I don‚Äôt get it. And if he‚Äôs waiting for 20 to collect, he will be disappointed. 

If Fsly drops to 20, I will take out a home equity loan on my house to buy on margins. Imagine the bidding war between Amzn, Msft, and Goog to buy them out.!remindme 6 monthsMarket sentiment is bullish right now. If you did not notice, VIX was down today even though there was a large sell off in Nasdaq. I am going to stay invested. Correction will come at some point but no one knows when. You can stay with cash and continue to be bearish as long as you do not repent loosing money in a market that is still moving upwards.Just posted this tidbit on the original post-

EDIT 2: Here is why MSFT will not care about moving Tiktok to Azure

I was trying to avoid doing this but here is a little math for those of you who care about it.

From Fastly's 10Q and shareholder letter published on August 7



Revenue for Q2, 2020 = $74.66MM

Revenue for Q1, 2020= $82.92MM

Revenue guidance from the chief: $290-300MM for FY2020

Tiktok's contribution to this revenue: 12% of $300MM = $36MM

Now, think about this #---> $36MM is what MSFT would have to pay Fastly if they are going to continue using them this year. Of course this number will get compounded every year with the Tiktok's growth.



Are you really convinced that a $1.6T market cap behemoth is interested in saving $36MM per year for an acquisition that they will be paying north of $60-65BB to Bytedance? I mean, really? This is a drop in the bucket for MSFT. Trust me on this. Tech spends more than that much money on free food for employees. If they were really thinking about cutting costs, you would have observed it from their other practices. I will not go any further than this statement.

Again, this is my perspective. You can believe what you want to, but I tried to give you a well documented reason behind why MSFT will not pursue Azure for Tiktok.None of the points addressed. Just mad you missed out on 4x.I personally prefer net to fastly, but thinking fastly will ever go back to 20$ is probably something you can only dream of. 

Fastly is a great product at the end of the day, and will almost certainly continue continue its exponential growth over the years to come.Its not going back to $20 unless the CEO and CTO die in a plane crash. Stop using this logic.I didn't even read past your first sentence. You're so green, please get out of the market for your own good.I agreed with you on MSFT won't move TikTok to Azure.

But I don't think we are discussing the same thing anymore.You're so green. You poor soul, you simply aren't ready for what's about to come.Meh roulette tableI had 36 8/21c on Uber, I was a dumbass and didn‚Äôt sell before earnings. Thought they were going to report a better Quarter. Lmao i was so wrong, lost most of my position, but after seeing the way uber fell, I was thinking the same thing with putting puts on Lyft. Not sure if this is the obvious play, what do others think?The real problem is if they report a slightly better LOSS than expected shares will likely creep up slightly... however, they still aren't making any money. At the end of the day all these companies posting quarterly loss after quarterly loss just need to be left to die... lol but I digress.If i‚Äôm not mistaken Uber did report a slightly better than loss only because of their delivery eats. Yet their price dropped. I see what your saying though. However with seeing how people responded to Uber earnings, I‚Äôm thinking Lyft will see a similar trend.Alteryx software is a piece of crap in crowded market, I'd stay out.Avoid it. Their product sucks and their random (mostly FOMO based) acquisitions have made product integration a nightmare.I am considering selling puts.  Very comfortable owning this around 110.yeah i hopped in this as wellI bought some Leaps today.Not to be harsh but how does anyone put a meaningful valuation on a name with a PE >1000? Technically?Looks like it might have more downside risk, high valuation with just 17% y/y growth.On a side note there p/e is ridiculousThis is the only answer. Google bought Looker. SFDC bought Tablaeu. There is no space in this market anymoreSell calls thenSome of the teams at my company recently started using it... My impression was that this is a good software but I guess you are suggesting otherwise.

Other than the competitors mentioned, what makes it a crappy software?Do you have a timeframe for how long you hold on to them?Can you elaborate on why there is no space in the market? Keen to understand why visualization (tableau) vs blending and ETL softwares (alteryx) are mutually exclusiveI bought the Leaps that expire in january 2022. Strike at the money, they were at 50 percent promo today, compared to yesterday. 
I mix this with my usual more risky playsThey are competing with products like Talend (open source), good old Ab Initio and ETL / Data Wrangling offerings from the Cloud Big Boys (aws, msft and gcp) in this space..Alteryx is ultimately a BI tool. Just doesn‚Äôt make sense to get it when these huge companies will inevitably build ETL functionality into things like Looker and Tableau.Thats fair point. One could argue that Alteryx will move towards visualization as well (they have it but it is just very poor).

Will we see this softwares moving towards a E2E data analytics tool, comprising ETL/ data virtualization, calculation layer, predictive analytics,  ML and Reporting layer? Maybe

To me the winner is going to be the one that can capture the biggest slice of the market in the short term. The massive cost involved with changing the DAta Analytics layer, and training acts as a barrier for the organization to keep the software that they had initially subscribed.Looker already has what you‚Äôre talking about with E2E with Looker and BigQuery. You can have ML models inside of looker. They‚Äôre basic as hell, but you can do it. 

Really the only thing it‚Äôs missing is ETL connectors...but they‚Äôre building an ecosystem on google essentially. For the ETL it‚Äôs really easy to just get something simple like Fivetran to handle that. There‚Äôs just no need for alteryx. I don‚Äôt get what they‚Äôre trying to do.Yep.  They are doing the grunt work of getting marijuana approved as a drug, as well as a smokeable synthetic version for cancer pain.  You know how chemo patients have been smoking pot for years, this would make that legit.  
  
Lots of joint ventures in other cannibis bio-tech as well.   Their main drug has been approved for orphan status, but the FDA had given indications that the drug(s) has potential for general pain applications as well. They are about to start phase 3 for the two drugs mentioned above.  Will need to raise 30-40M to complete phase 3.Definitely not a holding for everyone. It's a pre-revenue cannabinoid-derived bio-pharmaceutical stock, so the price action definitely reflects that fact. But for those who are unfamiliar, few key points: 


They have a supply agreement with APHA for cannabis inputs into their flagship drug (robust and varied pipeline, but PPP001 is top dog). APHA owns roughly 19.5% (if I recall from the last time I checked, could be a bit off) with Aphria's CFO Carl Merton on Tetra's board.


They have an cannabis pellet inhaler that is an approved device created under collaboration with Storz & Bickel (vaporizer kings... Volcano anyone?) who is now a wholly owned subsidiary of WEED. This agreement with Tetra was forged before Canopy acquired S&B, but they are still going forward, despite being in bed with Canopy's direct rival Aphria. This device called the Mighty Medic has been approved as a class 2 medical device by Health Canada.


The difficult issue with seeking DIN approval for cannabis derived drugs is the strict standards of variance with regards to inputs. Each batch of cannabis used as a drug input has to be nearly identical chemically, the tolerances are strict. [So back in Feb 2019](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/02/05/1710433/0/en/Tetra-Bio-Pharma-Redefines-Quality-Standards-for-Pharmaceutical-Grade-Cannabis-Derived-Products.html) there was an issue where Tetra self reported mycotoxin contamination in their inputs for PPP001 and temporarily suspended phase 3 trials. While the contamination levels met the requirements under the Cannabis Act and were more than acceptable for the legal recreational and medical markets (miniscule and negligible amount for the standard consumer), since this was for a cannabis derived drug and not just cannabis itself, Tetra made the decision to proactively rectify and improve the standards for themselves, worked with the FDA and their supplier, and essentially raised the bar on lower microbial contamination level. This hurt the share price obviously, a bio pharma company suspending trials is always interpreted as bad news, but it was actually quite prudent and hopefully smart in the long term. They anticipated a 6 month delay to evaluate the issue, but trials resumed [two months later in April 2019.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/04/09/1799525/0/en/Tetra-Bio-Pharma-Resumes-its-Phase-3-Clinical-Trial-Program.html)


The reason a DIN is important is because otherwise there is almost no hope that it will ever be adequately covered by insurance. As it stands there are technical workarounds where doctors or nurse practitioners can "prescribe" cannabis to patients, but this is not an actual drug prescription. It follows the legalities to sign up with licensed producers and allows patients to purchase direct from LPs for their needs, but good luck getting your insurance coverage to cover it. Personally my union's plan does, but they are extremely selective on coverage... basically you have to be terminally ill before they cover the cost. Once the DIN's exist, then prescriptions are real and can be covered/reimbursed and a large swath of patients who aren't looking to get ripped, just relief, suddenly are a user-base. In my mind this would be a situation where everybody wins.

So yeah, I follow and hold a bit of Tetra. Yes they are beat up, welcome to pre-revenue bio pharma. The science is sound as far as I can tell, the company is breaking ground, and they are in partnership with industry giants. They are doing it right and setting the standard. But of course there's always a chance of failure, pre-revenue means continuous capital raises, and that's always nasty. However on a personal level I'm confident in the pain relief efficacy of cannabis. Anecdotal evidence proves it has been used effectively for pain management with cancer patients for ages. Tetra is trying to clinically prove this fact. I've taken a principled stance with the capital I've allocated. I believe it is a superior and less harmful pain management alternative to opiates, specifically Fentanyl.My trading strategy for TBP since that huge offering.  Buy at 0.19 and sell at 0.22 repeatIts a good hold at the right price. They‚Äôre known to surge to $0.6-0.7 out of nothing. They seem to be well liked by both HC and the FDA - they even bypassed an approval phase with the FDA. The only issue is their cash burn. If they make it, they will be huge. Low risk at this price too in the short/medium term.Look into Lowe's!  Earnings on the 19th premarket. I'm holding tons of call options on them expiring on the 21st of Aug. If they beat Home Depot, things will get crazyMate, this was shared plenty of times on this sub: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1eIpH0RyJCGCQvhHZ8miP-DaGwU9bWqLb?fbclid=IwAR04MwZuHtTHVpVr9jTDh-UgcICFkO8pX9iqUqt0XvlHYDktqKLyuxuJ7mcI already have the intelligent investor book i have to say its a really hard book to read and understand idk maybe because English its not my main language but not gonna give up on it because the reviews on it are too good.For free ebooks, you can also check libgen(dot)is. It is the largest ebook library. If you have money though, support the writers by actually buying the books.The intelligent investor is so outdated, especially with its whole 70-30 principle. No point in buying bonds that yield 1% a year. Just stick all your money into SPY/VOO and you‚Äôll be fine, switching to bonds once you‚Äôre more worried about preserving your assets than growing your wealth.Thank you so muchLevel jumping (business, especially real estate)

Thanks for the share.TyLegend. Thanks!Thank you habibiNo it‚Äôs not because English wasn‚Äôt your main language.. the book itself was hard and confusing to read for me as well a few years ago.. it‚Äôs not beginner friendly imo

I actually don‚Äôt understand why ppl recommend this book to absolute beginners with no prior experience, it literally just confuses them and often discourages them from pursuing investing (someone actually explain to me why, I‚Äôm serious)

If you‚Äôre a business major then great, the book is understandable, if not then you‚Äôre in for a massive headache

There are so many better book alternatives for beginners out there

Once you get a hang of investing then Intelligent investor becomes more easy to digest and is a good book to read but not as a beginner 


Thanks for coming to my ted talk lmaoo <3If you don't have a finance background, it might seem difficult. But as you said, it is good and you should read it. Look up terms you don't know on investopedia. Once you manage to read it, you can try Security Analysis by the same author. It is considered to be more advanced than this one. More like a textbook.It is a higher level book where you have to know a lot of terms and concepts. No worries, it takes a few read throughs for the average person myself included to fully understand what is being taught.I gave up trying to read it and opted for the audiobook version, it‚Äôs very difficult to understand even for a fluent English speakerWhats SPY/VOO?I read finances books before this one , you can say i have  a background about investing.But not in stocks, im new to it, maybe thats why i was so confused every time i tried to read it again and again.Its not that i dont have a finance background i read alot of finance books tbh. The thing is i only interested in Real Estate and an actual business not in stocks and bonds thats how i heard about this book.Ohh and thx for the source dude i appreciate itWhere did you get the audiobook version?The full book is actually on YouTube[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTO8tm77LTE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTO8tm77LTE)Why are you so bullish on slv?I just bought a bunch of 30c 8/28 :) silver looks like it dipped and is about to go up over the weekend. I love playing the weekend SLV holdI am also bullish on Silver and Gold. If the Fed keeps on printing money which they will, the value of the dollar keeps on declining, making gold and silver more valuable as reserve currencies.I‚Äôd hold that call for a while. Silver is far from done. I was trying to buy into 1/15 27 calls today, but I missed the bottom.There‚Äôs a little thing called the fed.  If congress fails to deliver wouldn‚Äôt the fed take incredible measures in their own hands?SLV goes up more than gold when gold is going up which it is due to the planned inflationary fed policyIf you look at the chart for SLV it has been stepping up every week since the start of January. I believe it has a lot of room in the short term to grow. There is a lot of uncertainty in the world generally and smart money is looking for a safe haven. SLV is great because it‚Äôs very liquid but still provides the protection of holding physical silver. 

With talks of another stimulus package on the horizon I think that will weaken the dollar. Also the ratio between gold and silver is too high and needs a correction. Gold has increased to over $2000 oz whole silver is still hovering at $25. Based on historical trends silver  should be around $50 to maintain that ratio.Exactly. I think we will see a run up next week and the following.Yeah it‚Äôs rallying a bit at the moment, I think we will see $30 next week or twoThat should help my position, don‚Äôt you think? They can‚Äôt lower interest rates so they have to print.Yep with the 2nd stimulus coming. I think it‚Äôs very likely to see this happening. Also, Peter Schiff does a great job outlining this trend. However, I have to note that he does own a gold company and could have biased opinion. But still the into is worthwileJpow may not have a choice on negative rates.  Let‚Äôs face the fact that there is debate on metals implies something is very wrong on the economy.  Remember what the fed did when China tariffs came in play.  This debacle is many times worse. Just wondering was is the next move from the fed. Unfortunately I am bullish metals.They will absolutely not go into negative rates, that would jumpstart extreme inflation.Isn‚Äôt that what the fed wants?They want 2%, not run-away inflation they can‚Äôt controlWe have extreme deflation and fed will risk hyperinflation!  No choice!  Took a world war to get us out of the Great Depression.  Quick math says two decadesJust go to r/wallstreetbets and start taking notesOpen a brokerage account and trade optionsCash/TFSA/rrsp you‚Äôll be allowed to buy calls and puts and sell covered calls. 

To work with spreads like butterflies, iron condors, verticals, all that Jazz, you need a margin account so you can sell options in the spread.

I‚Äôd also consider looking at IB as a brokerage if your going down option route. Pretty much every other broker charges 9.99 ticket charge and 1.00 per contract for options. Just gets absurdly pricey, especially with spreads.Went into TD literally 2 weeks ago....she basically told me to eat dick. You‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs a completely new account and you have to apply for it. They send it off the application (still haven‚Äôt heard back) and they ask to see how much experience you have with trading options, shorts etc etc. Go in and apply anyway. I use Webbroker....I‚Äôm looking into Questtrade though for optionsIts margin account. You can open online. 

For full options with td, you need to pass the examJust did it with BMO. Call them, say you want to switch to a margin account, fill out some papers, and then its done.Try doing the wheel, it works really wellI'm not sure if you can trade NYSE options in your registered account.

You want to open a non-registered account (with TD). They probably will test your knowledge on options so be prepared.

Then ask for access to use Thinkorswim platform, one of the best for option trading.Trading options in Canada should only be done at interactive brokers. Or else you'll get killed by commissions. Compare the fee schedules between the different brokers.I already have a brokerage account that I trade stocks out of.Yea just buying calls / puts is enough.

I'm wondering how I activate it for my cash or TFSA account.

When I called they said I have to open a completely brand new account? 

And do I have to answer any questions to pass a test or something. I read somewhere that you might have toQuestrade is a good starting point for options.Ah that blows.Open a margin account

https://www.td.com/ca/products-services/investing/td-direct-investing/accounts/direct-trading/Never did with TD. Theirs usually something to sign/agreement. Usually they want x amount of years of options experience yada yada yada. Basically they don‚Äôt want to be on the hook when you lose all your money either by throwing all your money on some crapshoot option or selling a naked call. 

Usually theirs a few levels. Level 1 allow buying puts/calls. Level 2 allow spreads, level 3 allow naked short selling. 

When you say TD do you mean TD bank or TD Direct Investing. You‚Äôd need TD DI for options.If the person at TD told you that you can‚Äôt they were mistaken. I‚Äôve been buying calls and puts and selling covered calls for years in my TFSA. I‚Äôm with RBC, there was a form I had to sign and fax to them to enable options on my TFSA. Should be something similar with TD.You're not supposed to "trade" in a TFSA, so open a margin account. IB will be your best bet in terms of commissions.Well higher share price, fewer bimbos there are looking to make quick cashI think it's a trend thing.  When they started to hit high numbers, people assumed they would split. When they didn't, it was exciting, intriguing.  They started this trend of having really high prices which had a prestige about it.  I think apple is doing a similar but opposite, trying to stay in the news by announcing a split.  Think about it, they've been talked about by this community and other investors non stop for the last week.  People who don't invest are also likely to jump in because they see it as a good entry or it just put apple stocks on their radar.  I think it's all two sides of the PR coin.Uh sir Google literally split their company in halfI prefer the high price than to have speculators swing trade themI own 1 share of amazon that I got at $1500. I‚Äôd love for a 10:1 split so I could have 10 shares and feel inclined to add more. I‚Äôll never have a spare $3200+ and I‚Äôm too OCD for fractional shares lolI don‚Äôt think this is really ever the deciding factor, but one thing to keep in mind is that a company has to pay a lot of legal and financial fees to actually make the split happen. So from the business‚Äô point of view it only creates expenses without generating any income. 

Admittedly for a huge Amazon or Google those expenses aren‚Äôt going to be a drop in the bucket. But I thought I would point out they don‚Äôt just flip a switch and make it happen, and they don‚Äôt really get anything out of the time and money that it takes either.I would love for AMZN to do a split because a single share is taking up way too much space in my measly little portfolio. I'm too OCD to just buy a fractional share.The theory is that the higher share prices make it more enticing (meaning cheaper) for institutional investors to purchase more shares by having less individual commissions.I believe the true answer is because it creates a barrier to entry for small investors. Why block small investors? Because large investors move slower. The stock can benefit from steady pricing vs volatile pricing which in turn beckons more large investors. Large investors also tend to understand long term gain which smaller investors are less inclined to hold. An increase in shareholders holding pattern is also great for the stock. No big selloffs.My online broker offers fractional shares anyway so doesn't matter to meI hope that in the near future, more brokers will give the opportunity to trade fractional stocks. Especially if you are just getting started in the financial world, it would be nice if there was an ability to trade fractionals if a stock is for example over 1000$ per share.Because they don't want robinhooders in there I guess.I‚Äôve always figured they‚Äôd Berkshire it. Really I think both could be appealing.Because they don't need the added pressure and volatility that comes with day traders going all-in on their stock. The higher the price, the more they attract institutional money that is generally smarter and doesn't panic sell when the market tanks 3%.They don't like filthy casual investorsYah they're elitist and only want rich investorsThey don't need the increased cash flowOooohhhmuhgaw.  Fucking hell.....I‚Äôm sorry, ‚Äúbimbos‚Äù?? 

That was fucking funny.  My thanks and apologies in advance for stealing that little nugget many many times in the future.Bingo!Read in Jeff Goldblum voice.This....    share prices that high, it‚Äôs for the serious longs and not the swing crowd[removed]Same here lol. Whole Foods employee and had 1 share ‚Äúgifted‚Äù at $1,700. I‚Äôm not complaining...There is still high demand for this stock even at a high price tag, so I read in an article.Is this true? I tried to spend a few minutes googling it but haven‚Äôt found any confirmation. If you have any resources or a link to share, it would be cool to learn something new on here today. It sounds believable, anyways.Thats not how it works.You don‚Äôt understand how stocks workDelete nowSomeone explain why this is downvoted to hell pleaseChange your apartment, change the worldI'm doing pretty well with my buy and hold....they gifted you guys all 1 share when they bought?Jim Cramer says this phenomenon is in effect all the time. We are the "retail" investor while hedge funds are the institutional investors. 

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/31/cramer-cheers-apples-stock-split-decision-apple-cares-about-the-little-guy.htmlNature, uh,  abhors SPY puts.Welcome to the group! There are certainly plenty of knowledgeable people here, I'm relatively new to the group as well. 

Here are a few key things I wish I had been told when I first started trading options not long ago:

1. Before you trade ANY options make sure you understand how they work and the risks associated with each strategy, know your maximum potential loss.

2. Selling naked options carries unlimited risk and one bad trade could easily blow up your account if the trade goes south. A good alternative is using credit/debit spreads as it puts a cap on your maximum loss.

3. I have had the most success with covered calls and they are relatively easy to understand and execute.

4. Do not put all your eggs in one or two baskets with options, when options trades go south, they lose value much quicker than stocks, and then poof before you know it they're expired and you have nothing. I would recommend using options as a way to hedge your stock positions and lower your cost basis for shares. Spreads can also be a great way to make some cash, just make sure you are not committing significant amounts of capital to a single options trade like you would when buying a stock. 

For example, if XYZ drops 20% and you own the stock, at least you just lost 20% and still have 80% of your equity, if that happens with options it can often result in you losing 100% of your equity so adjust your capital allotment accordingly! 

Hope that helps a little, good luck!Trade small, trade liquid options, have a plan for up down unchanged.

Understand the Greeks, the max risk. I suggest keeping at least 50 percent of your buying power in reserve for a long while.

Consider doing spreads instead of selling naked, especially on high dollar underlyings. Less profit, but way less max risk. If doing spreads watch the ex-dividend dates carefully.

Portfolio margin will help a great deal, but all that additional buying power can be a deadly temptation for some. At many brokers, $125k and passing an exam are required to get portfolio margin.

Regular margin for selling puts on SPY might be 20 percent. So to sell one strike 300 put, the margin might be $6k per put sold ($30000 x .20). This might be different at different brokers, and is always subject to change. 

For volatile underlyings it tends to be higher. 50 percent on up for select fast movers.Thanks for the response. How has your experience been with the margin requirements for selling naked options? Been learning a bit about what requirements exist for indexes vs equities and what percent of the stock price you're supposed to holdthank you for the response! very thorough. Do you have any interesting stories or anecdotes about trading uncovered options? I would love to hear horror or dream stories to really get a fuller view of how this plays out in real timeTo be honest, I've never traded naked options but i know the margin requirements are significant because your broker is factoring in the worst case scenario. From what I understand, if you are selling puts, you must have enough margin available to purchase the underlying stock if you are assigned. for example, you sell 10 contracts of XYZ put options at the $20 strike price, you must have $20,000 of available margin ($20 x 1000 shares) to purchase the stock if you are assigned.

In the case of selling calls, I'm not sure what they do since the risk is unlimited. for example, if you sell 10 XYZ call options at $20 Strike and the stock rockets to $80 overnight, that means you would need $80 x 1000 shares = $80,000 to buy the shares which you would then sell to person who purchased the call for $20k, resulting in a $60K net loss, and if course it gets worse as the price rises.

They have high margin requirements for good reason, stuff like I mentioned above happens everyday! so don't be that guy!

For indexes, I would imagine the requirements are a lot less since they can't move as far and fast as an individual stock since they are inherently diversified by being composed of many different assets.One interesting story I shared was about BA Boeing

https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/b03hv7/surviving_the_boeing_crash/

The short version is that I came into Monday short 7 naked strangles on BA various strikes. On Friday I was near delta neutral, but a $60 gap down after the plane crash, changed that. 

I ended up losing 3 percent of my account on that day.

My rule number one is

Live to trade another day. [https://earlyretirementnow.com/2018/12/18/the-optionsellers-debacle/](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2018/12/18/the-optionsellers-debacle/)for puts the margin often isnt the whole amount. usually i find it is around 80% but if there would be a drop to similar price to the option strike it would rise to 100% so margin reuqirements can swing you into margin call easily even though nothing is "ITM".   

you definiteiyl cannot use all your margin at a specific time and when i dabbled in this i tended to target around 80% at most.    

regarding calls it is similar. there is formulae and it takes a worst case approach. so if you sold an option which is way out you will probably face a 80% requirement or e.g. 100% of the current share price. and if it rises it will go to 100% +2x standard deviations of the strike price to allow for swings last minute.This is a great link thank you. Helps me really understand what bad risk management looks like and what to avoid doingThanks for the clarification!NPAnyone else following these results?

Seems the market was viewing them as a company that would benefit from covid. Was trading around 10-11 before but rose to 15-16 after covid.

Their financial results didn't really change much. I guess that's still impressive that there wasn't notable impact in these numbers? Perhaps the market was overly optimistic here?They are literally at the mercy of their input costs (virgin pulp and old corrugated container), I would only buy this as a mean reversion playI took a very deep dive into them around April, when I noticed just how much more paper towels I was using in my daily life. The issue with them is debt. They could have decades of pandemic level demand and it'd still barely move the needle.

On the topic of this quarter though, it does surprise me that they had a ~2% drop in sales. From what I can see anecdotally, usage is still at Q1 levels, so that 2~ must have been purely stockpiling/hoarding. Didn't think the panic buying was that muchI think your right. It probably has deviated a little too far on the hopes it was going to be a covid winner (which doesn't actually seem to be the case). I've seen this swing from ~14 to ~9 and back again that last few years.

Raw material cost always seems to be a topic with them. While the price seems volatile, is there any reason to believe it will trend against their favour longer term?I imagine they are taking a hit in the commercial sales. Offices and such are buying much less hygienic paper products.I believe it's 1.4 debt to equity ratio. Down a fair bit since 2015, as are the shares outstanding, while cash and dividends increased.

What's your concern on the debt?

Seems one of the bigger variables that comes up every quarter is the volatile cost of inputs.Maybe on the Containerboard side, if we permanently stop sending OCC to China then eventually with all the box volume domestically more and more of it ends up recycled so you get an oversupply of that. For tissue papers it just seems countercyclical. Lots of other players with stronger margins than CAS in pretty much everything they do. But they got less debt and more scaleApparently ~40% of CAS‚Äôs tissue shipments is for the 'away for home' market. I think it's not just offices closing, but hospitality industries, restaurants, etc.  

I think even though people are using online shipping more, there's  some concern there could be less purchasing in general(outside of food). therefore less cardboard packaging needed to package goods in.If anything I‚Äôd think they‚Äôre doing better. My workplace goes through at least 3x the paper towels we did before hand. I‚Äôd assume any other essential workplace is similar. We‚Äôve all got mandatory cleanings several times a shift, and standard reusable rags are no more, replaces by disposables.

Now sure offices have all been wfh, but I would assume this shift covers that lossJust to say this deserves to trade at such a low multiple relative to peers. On the management side its a bunch of old people, YES they own stock but do they really care to maximize shareholder value at this point in their life? They havent made the worst decisions so far but its just such a low ROIC business> standard reusable rags are no more, replaces by disposables

I didn't even think of this. Based on results, seems it really isn't enough to make up for all the businesses that are shut down. It not just offices that are closed.**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

Crazy.My takeaway is that he spent 5b on buy backs but brk cash reserve went up.Green Monday?How many of us did a Roth conversion in late March and April this year?Been riding my BRK.B calls to 1000% gains so far.  My gut tells me there's still room due to the large number of classic big investors missing the rally in March who anticipated a second crash that never arrived. Still a good amount of cash holding out there.That‚Äôs why the stock is going up.What does this mean to the average joe like me?Just realized that Buffett bought an ADDITIONAL $2 Billion of stock in July. So BRK is still  10% undervalued based on Friday's close. This is based on a 1.3x book multiple, which is the lower side of BRK's trading history.Share price was too low?[removed]Sounds like sell-off time.If that is the case he bought airline as it dive. Sold it at the bottom before US government step in to bail them out. Then proceed to buy back when brk was at the high in June. Look like he buy high and sell low. I know hindsight is 2020 but he should bought more tech or increase holding in apple as the thesis with tech did not change and they benefit. Just saying.I think you dropped a zero.I know right? Why are their share so expensive? The cost of one share is most people's annual salary.Investment so good it goes up even when you try to spend it - 

The buffett paradoxThose sweet sweet dividends maybe?Agreed and agreed. That $140B in cash is held in incredibly liquid and low paying investments. It is amazing to think that a company that is worth ~$510B has $140B (~27%) in cash earning almost nothing.

There is plenty of potential for BRKB.Been up for the last month or so, don‚Äôt see why it would stop.Dead cat bounce üôèüèΩ üòÇWhy? Can someone explain to me please I‚Äôm genuinely curiousWhen you retire the optimal strategy is to have a mixture of Roth and Traditional accounts. That way you can fill in the lowest tax brackets by withdrawing from Traditional funds. Once you start hitting the higher tax brackets you pull money out with Roth.

For a married couple, the Federal tax bracket up to $40,125 is only 12%.

Thus it would only make sense to do this strategy if you have sufficent funds in traditional or plan to replenish them.Would have been smart. Damn, I wish someone said something back then.I harvested $10000 of tax loss in Feb. Does that count?I missed out on this opportunity which would have been very useful to me. Where can I learn more about this type of tax strategy?I‚Äôm with you in this one stranger[removed]S t o n k s    only go    u pStocks go up, stocks go down, sometimes stocks stay the same.

Hmmm.How many people do you know who's annual salary is 300k/yr?Wait wot. 

Most people‚Äôs annual salary is $314k? You have a strong circle.Why not? People can just by class B. Class A is unsplit since forever. He's pretty clear about it in this shareholder lettersTo prevent trading it mostly. Buffet has always been about lifetime investing.

SAY WHAT?! That moment you realize >50% of the workforce earns less than $20/hr and is scheduled for less than 30 hours a week because their employers dont want to pay for their health insurance;  and you have a really detached view of society.This used to be a big deal but it doesn't really matter anymore because people can buy fractional shares or class B shares.

There used to be a financial services company that was buying the shares and running a fund to sell smaller shares to make a profit. That forced them to create the class B shares because they didn't want someone profiting off the situation.That‚Äôs the class A. They also never pay dividends, so that the share owners pay taxes when they cash out rather than yearly on divs. It‚Äôs a wealthy person asset for sure - also only about 25% of BRKA is held by institutions.

Attracts long term, serious investors instead of casuals.lol my annual salary is not even close to thatNot even a decade salary for us peasantsNo stock splits is a big one. Apple for example has stock at 700$ and is splitting it 7 to 1, so the share will be worth 100$. This isn't their first time either.An example of how the wealthy rigs the system to push the losses on to the lower classes while getting premium returns on their worthless shares, thanks to the Fed printing monopoly money. This is a very good example of how buybacks work and why the value of the shares does not make sense. It is a con game played by the Fed and the wealthy.Most people?

Class B shares are more than most people's salaries. Class A shares are houses. The reason class A shares are so expensive is because they've never been split and have traded for decadesBummer hindsight 20/20.

With equities at lows the taxable amount was very low. So, take your traditional IRA with a $500k balance in February, now it's worth $350k. Withdraw, pay the taxes, put it in your Roth and watch it sprint back to $475k, now tax free.Convert when the market was down 20-30%, lock in a taxable event on 70-80k for a 100k 12/31/2019 balance; market recovered and you only payed taxes on 70-80k, instead of 100k. 

Balance now is tax free

Also, there are no RMDs due for 2020, so people in retirement could have a lower tax bracket this year.How are we going to pay for the trillions in stimulus payments?I am not sure it works like that. Doesn‚Äôt your roth income still contribute to increasing your taxable bracket? So let‚Äôs say you pull 40k trad and  40k Roth. You would not pay 12% on the Trad but rather the next bracket up because of the Roth income? 
Or do I have that all wrong and Roth income is a totally separate measurement?Your submission was automatically removed because it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/investing.

If you give someone a financial incentive to make people part-time for under 30 hours it will happen.Found the socialist.How do you put that much into a Roth when the limit is $6k a year?Additionally, you could straddle tax years because of the timing. So you could take half out before the tax cutoff and pay it this year, and then take the other half and pay it next April.

EDIT: Nevermind, ignore this. I'm wrong here.Oh that's clever!  


I'll have to remember that for the next crash in 10-12 years.Don‚Äôt you pay a penalty for withdrawing early? How much do the potential gains outweigh the tax penalties?Nicely fine. I took out my 401k. Bought a shit ton of quality stuff in March and away we go.

A cool idea, but sadly not how it works. Any withdrawals or conversations are taxed in the year of the transaction, so whether you take it out in March or in April doesn't make a difference since it's all done in 2020, and, therefore, due on your 2020 taxes.Just be sure to get the timing of cash transfers and reinvestment done quickly so arent out of the market during the rise10-12 years? But i was told it would crash any day now?You've got it nailed down to a 2 year window I seeWhen is a withdrawal considered qualified?Yes do it, and then go to the meetings as a shareholderSome yes. Some gross annual.That‚Äôs not in reference to my name. I sell BMW and work with a good number of clients who make over $300,000 a yearTo make ends meet many were forced to take on multiple part-time jobs. People that were working one 40 hours a week job pre-ObamaCare now have to spend extra time and money commuting to two 20 hours a week jobs.I see.  

So you‚Äôd have to have all that money sitting in a regular IRA already and then time the market at just the right time.  It‚Äôs a good idea in principle but actually making it happen would be quite another story.Apologies. Didn't mean to spread misinformation.

In reality it's a yearly consideration, much like tax loss harvesting.Not a tax professional, but I'm pretty sure this only applies to "coronavirus related distributions" which I don't think includes Roth conversions.

Down 13k for the day. Any hope for me?You're not screwed, but it's not an ideal situation. You need FB to rally a little less than 3% next week. That's a totally reasonable possibility.

One way to handle this trade would be to make a straightforward plan like this:

Open an Excel spreadsheet. In one column, write M T W R F. In the other, write down where FB would have to trade for you to be uncomfortable about your position and close it out. If your brokerage has a tool for setting alerts, you can set an alert for the price of FB and update it as the week goes on.

Maybe something like this (I just chose some numbers that make sense to me)

|< 265|<  270|<  273|<  275|<  276|

It could end up really bad.If you play with the right ratio of debt to assets it is really managable i keep a consistant 10-20% of my portfolio as debt and i dont really have an issue with itDebt often has a negative connotation associated with it. In reality, if you are intelligent, knowledgeable, disciplined, and conservative, in my opinion, using someone else‚Äôs money in addition to your own money is a great approach in accelerating towards your financial goals quicker in comparison to simply using your own money. Without going into numbers and/or strategies, debt is an excellent tool if you understand it.I'm considering it right now. Margin with interactive brokers is like 1.5%, I wouldn't buy any meme stocks like Nickola, with it though. I'm looking at it for leveraging up on some more conservative plays like utilities( FTS/EMA/TRP) some banking, and fixed income.Can you tell us what you've invested in?What others have said.
PLUS
Are you using tax free accounts for the leverages proceeds? If not keep track of interest to reduce taxes at tax time. 

Further, I recently though about how the Smith maneuver/mortgage "stress test" would apply in this situation. You should find a calculator and run some numbers. Based on your income and expenses/other debt see if it falls within the parameters.I have a portion of my investments leveraged with unsecured debt, about $20k. I have a very stable job and I have a low interest rate (3.95%). I primarily invested in blue chip/dividend paying equities, as well as a few sector specific ETFs.  I am comfortable as I am confident in the companies I invested in (banks, insurance, utilities, a little bit of REITS) will appreciate and certainly not drop their dividends. Would I do it without a stable job, most likely not.I think that might be the issue I'm facing, my current ratio is currently about 40-50% (a few months ago it was 90%), though I do plan on reducing that ratio.I invested in boring Canadian blue chip companies; sectors like utilities, Canadian banks, warehouse REITs.The other strategy i recommend is keeping a portion of that margin as higher yielding dividend paying stocks so your going to be able to pay your monthly payments using those dicidendsBoring is great!If they are in the money they have to be exercised before closing and the call buyer can exercise untl 5:30, someone correct me if I'm wrng on the timeAt 5:00 it was trading at a high of 266.4That's why I always try to close out options on expiration day, especially if they are close to the moneyDon't they expire at 4pm?Why did Robinhood force me to buy at $269 instead of $266.4?NoThey expire at 5:30pm (EST), and then they're exercised at 11:59am on Saturday. The price can fluctuate in after-hours trading.They can beexercised up to about 1.5 hrs after closing, so the price can gyrate wildly with low volumne. The option holder may have even bought a few shares at that price so they could dump the shares on you at a higher price. Same the happened to me on GLD, but I lucked out and the premarket was higher Monday and I sold at a small  profit.**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

I only have 215 shares, costs basis of $97.63 per share.   I can say that I wouldn't have bought in 2016 if had it been anywhere close to $400 per share and I do see smaller investors buying when it's closer to $100.82,000 robinood users? What's that, like 0.001% of the market cap?Apple cap added ~350B in a week.

That's about 1 Samsung in a week. Or 1 TSMC in a week.

Just because they earned more than a few guys called "analysts" predicted.It's too overpriced. Fuck this market.[removed][removed]Probably...but it's also going back down to 1 TrillionI bought at 550 pre 7 for 1 split. Worked out pretty well. 

Share price is irrelevant. If you're saying at 400 the valuation was too high, then that's a different topic.>I wouldn't have bought in 2016 if had it been anywhere close to $400 

why not? you have 215 shares so it wouldn't have mattered.Sure. Smaller investors *might* buy more at 100/share. Though with fractional shares on many platforms, I‚Äôm not convinced it matters much now. Many retail investors have $500 or $1000 in AMZN.Also because they showed their incredible stickiness as an ecosystem and numerous pathways of growth. Reassuring shareholders that they do well all the time, not just in boom economies, is valuable.

And also because of a short squeeze.This market is a bubble, full stop.

Market cap remains the same.Share price is relevant psychologically when you're a young investor and have a few thousand to invest, evidenced by so much being bought via Robinhood.  $400 is not too high right now, no.It was way under priced. It was priced like it was going to start declining as a company. That obviously didn't happen and now it's priced like it's going to keep growing and is well positioned for the future. It may be over priced now but it's not a bubble.All i see is crying tearsWow that is a telling story!Do you have an explanation for that? I thought only retail suffers from FOMO.A $30bn increase in revenue is a big deal, that could cover the revenue of 15 entire companies for the whole fiscal year in some cases.
I wouldn‚Äôt ignore that growth.Of course it won't.

My issue is with the valuation. Not with the split.

You take a pie and cut it into a million pieces and it still has the same calories.I always tell young investors to concentrate on P/E instead of the stock price.Retail traders aren't going to have any meaningful impact on the share price.[deleted]So although you understand that it's just a psychological thing you still wouldn't have bought Apple in 2016 if they were "optically" more expensive?

That doesn't make sense. You are not a smart investor. Please keep investing. Thanks.Yeah - it looks like in 2015 its market cap was about 500B and in the five years since then they've made over 250B in profit. I would love to invest in companies that generate that much compared to cost.What makes you think it would go back down to 1T and lose half it‚Äôs market value?Why do you think Apple is overvalued ?
To me, they are one of the only mega caps that are realistically priced. 

None of this ‚Äúfuture potential‚Äù shit... they have been raking in the cash for decades now with no sign of slowing.If they do that they‚Äôre not buying anything right now...And most platforms don't allow fractional shares and fractional shares feel illegitimate too many.Please, there's no reason to be insulting in an investing discussion.  I retired at age 52 as a single woman.  My investing has been pretty smart so far.Not to mention they‚Äôve actually recognised the need for bringing affordable models of their popular products that can meet the lower tier consumer need, the iPhone SE being a huge step forward for trying to break through in the budget smart phone market.

iOS, macOS and watchOS far exceeds any other operating systems in all corners of the markets and in order to be part of the club you have to buy their hardware, simple as that.

That‚Äôs not going to change any time soon and it would take an absolute monster of an organisation to ever topple that grip on the market that Apple has.Nice! So you have more money now! PLEASE KEEP INVESTING, I'M BEGGIN YOU!Yes. MSFT / AAPL / AMZN / GOOG / NVDA / DIS and many more are all set and forget if you're looking into individual stocks.YesI taught myself about stocks 8 years ago and that's basically what I did. I picked a few strong companies, purchased and its been sitting. One of my picks was Clorox, that has worked out very well for me. In my opinion that's what you do in the stock market find a company you belive in and stay invested as long as you belive in them. I like dividend stocks and have the dividend reinvested so my share amounts grow but it is not the only thing I consider and I have some stocks without dividends. 
Its been fun.Yes. Buy and Hold.  I will add MSFT instead of DIS to the list.I would say just index it right now if your are starting out..  build up 10k or more into indexes before going after individual equitiesWMYes. I wish I treated my first $5000 with respect.Yes or a safe etfConsider UPSYesFor what you're talking about not a bad idea. I would caution against going to heavy with your portfolio in one direction like 3200 of 5000 on amazon. Maybe buy a fractional share for 1,000. 

Best tip my mom who was a broker for 15 years gave me if going long is diversify by industry. Menaing pick a few good blue chips in each industry (tech, biotech, communications, travel, industrial) and spread out the money. Certain industries tend to move together and others opposite. 

When tech does well, healthcare typically doesnt and vice versa. If youre spread out if one tanks but the other comes up you blance out. Also doing covered calls is never a bad idea if going long. Youll need 100 shares of something to do it but it can be considered passive income depending how far out of the money you place your option.

Personally i have about 5k in my trading portfolio, i also have a vanguard retirement etf i put a few hundred in every month plus my 401k. I have at least 3k in long term holdings that do shift month to month. Last few months ive been riding the microsoft wave until i saw amd popping on july 22nd and shifted those funds from microsoft into amd. Then later shifted money out of livongo back into Microsoft after the teladoc deal was announced. Of the reamining 2,000, half I "play with" I try to do short swing trades with. I see something way out of wack and bet it reverts to its moving average line then sell when it gets there for small gains. But those funds are constantly moving. Currently i put about 200 into 5 small cap penny stocks like hmhc, cndt, oss, hbp, uavs (all 5 went up after i bought friday, and i plan on checking monday to see if worth holding or just sell for the profits and move onto the next one). The other half I do weekly swing trades with blue chips. One of my favorites to play is mpc, its volatile and semi predictable, I typically aim for a quick 8-10% gain then sell and wait for another buy point. Right now that money is on crowdstrike and a small ev delivery vehicle company.

If going long and you really dont want to look or ever have to react, a vanguard etf is your best bet, you dint even need to do anything other than deposit money into the account. If you wann go long with the ability to shift funds as hype and news changes then just do blue chips. It never stresses me out when something like microsoft looks like its crashing even with 1500 on it. But 200 into a penny stock that goes down is tiring and can be stressful and emotionally draining.Apple has a 4:1 stock split comingI would suggest index funds instead. VTI, VOO and VONE are some good ones. Reason being is that you get exposure to hundreds or even thousands of stocks for a fraction of the cost, many of which include the ones you listed. But to answer your question, its a fine start.Awesome start! Holding them for good twenty years would be a better ‚Äústart‚Äù.Yes - but arguably better would be index funds. SPY, or VFV if you‚Äôre Canadian.

Reason: Lower risk due to more diversification. A SP500 fund would also include AAPL, AMZN, and DIS. Downside is your growth is more limited.I‚Äôd buy something not blown out.  Limited potentialYesIdk pick 2 or 3. 10 you may as well just use an etf or index fundNumber of stocks doesnt matter. Total money invested matters.  5 amazon and 5 apple are very different.

Also, dont look at stock price, look at market cap (aka the companys total value).  Just cuz a stock price is lower doesnt mean its cheaper than a different stockI‚Äôm going to take the contrarian route and say 5 stocks - which are primarily tech - isn‚Äôt diversified enough for a long term portfolio, and if you do go down that route I‚Äôd reassess every year or so. Remember General Electric?Get to know product variety first. Big tech is a good start, but then it's diversity, which is almost impossible without ETFs and stuff...I don‚Äôt agree. They‚Äôre too expensive for a small account. Lots of good opportunities out there that aren‚Äôt in the headlines. Get more shares with something cheaper. I got NET in May at $28. It‚Äôs dipped a little but not as bad as FSLY. 

It‚Äôs a well respected company and I invested in it after I learned it cut off 8chan after Charlottesville. 

Full disclosure, I own NVDA and have traded MSFT and will probably again but I trade almost daily.

I think the ETFs are a good idea since it‚Äôs managed for you in a sense that a professional decides on the holdings. 

I would suggest FFTY not quite an ETF but diverse holdings. You can get more shares since it‚Äôs under$40.Bought 5 shares of MSFT mid-March. Currently up 27% on those shares. YesYes but i‚Äôd wait for a pull back, all time high isn‚Äôt the best entryAAPL might take a hit in next few months if Trump ban on wechat is serious.

Basically the iphone would be useless in China if Wechat is forced out of the Apple store.

DIS I'm neutral on.

AMZN I'm bullish on since I don't see any vaccine coming to market next quarter.  And if polling is true that there anti-vaxxer unwilling to vaccinate.  Then home delivery will be the norm.

Also with MSFT caught up in spending possibly $50B to buy TikTok and pay the US Treasury a few billion as a broker fee.  Azure will probably take a backseat to AWS.With the stock split coming up and the dip on Friday the moment market opens on Monday would be the best chance you've got to pile hard into AAPL. I'd suggest putting all 5k into it but that does mean you don't have diversification, so do what you will. But yes, AAPL specifically is a great buy rnI'll keep that in my mind my good sir!What about GE and Ford? Are they also set and forget?Short and sweet. Thank you.TLDR: Don't fall victim to "home country bias" // diversification is the only free lunch in investing // buy international // US is overvalued // cap weighting inherently buys the top.

I'm going to provide the counter narrative (actually Meb Faber and Bridewater are) and my simple answer would be "no".

The general premise is that the valuation of the US equities market is currently pushing on historical highs while there are tons of markets around the world that are relatively very cheap. As Meb notes in other tweets, there is ZERO valuation premium in US markets as compared to international (in other words there is no historical out performance).

I couldn't find this exact tweet but if you follow Mebs writings enough you will hear him say this all the time, but -- if you look at performance of US and international markets at this current snapshot in time, then US has GREATLY outperformed international. But thats counter to the zero historical risk premium for US markets you say? Well when you dig into it, all of the out performance of US markets relative to international has come in the last 10 years (since financial crisis). In other words, currently the US markets are valuated very far from historical averages and at some point there will be a mean reversion.

IMO the main takeaway from these insights is that by buying US equities at this moment you are basically chasing gains in the macro cycle and buying into the most richly valued market. Furthermore, buy buying the largest stocks within that market (us bluechips), you are effectively employing a cap weighted strategy and so you are specifically picking the most richly valued individual stocks. So now you see the issue probably? Large cap stocks are the most highly valued individual stocks within the most highly valued equities market in the world. Yes, the current trend could easily continue (especially considering all the insane fed policy that was just enacted) but there is also a pretty high chance that the trend doesn't continue (lots of signs that this cycle is swinging) and if thats the case then you are basically buying at the top of the top.

&#x200B;

My recommendation for someone who is just starting to invest would be to build a core portfolio based on several CHEAP index funds (etfs not mutuals) and then once you have a decent egg built up, then start investing in individual stocks. This is not the sexiest approach and honestly probably wont be the highest returning approach in the short term, but it will definitely be the smartest and most predictable approach from a long term wealth appreciation perspective.

Here is an example porfolio you could use (I just pulled these weightings out of thin air so you would obviously want to tweak that yourself or add other thematic tilts like maybe etfs focused on value, growth, healthcare, etc):

\- 30% VXUS (Total International index fund that is NOT cap weighted...ie includes smaller companies along with the big ones)

\- 40% VTI (Total US index....also not cap weighted)

\- 15% EM (emerging markets etf)

\-15% AGG (total US bond etf)

&#x200B;

Anyway, here are some links to read. This is all very counter to the general tone and sentiment on most of the reddit investing threads which is pretty much US THE BEST and in my opinion perfectly exemplifies the issues that Meb outlines (home country bias). They use all sorts of narratives about "us innovations" and this and that but in the end they are still falling victim to the same pitfall.

If you do something different from the herd and it works out you look like a genius and if you do something different and fail you look like an idiot.

I trade forex but with stocks, I want to stick with the big boys. I'm a fan of ETFs too hence I bought variations of vanguards and will continue to do so.

Need to read the 10k of these three and throw in a buttload of money to the winner.Will look into this sirThanks mate!I will review it sir!Curious why you thought the merger with tdoc was bad. Obviously you were correct but I as a noob would not have thought that. I also thought that MPC selling off speedway was a huge boost to the stock and it's been my biggest loser so far. What am I missing about these types of events?Great advice. Thank you so muchI do covered calls on CSCO NVDA TGT but OP is a newbie and doesn‚Äôt want to monitor his portfolio so I wouldn‚Äôt suggest options yet.And I'm very excitedThat's the plan! I'm keep adding more every quarterXSP is basically IVV on the TSX but CAD hedged. I had that before I transferred to a US one.Yes I agree. I do use some technical analysis so I wait for dipsI wish I knew that when I started. I was like, damn Amazon is expensive at 1,700. I ended up buying at 2,600 months later when I was more educated.I do. And I completely agree with you. Majority of my my investments will go to ETFsI already have etfs and wi continue to add more. I still lack funds to diversify fully but will do so graduallySure thing. I'll look into it. Thanks for the inputthank you for the insight. I don't own any MSFT yet since it did a gap up and I don't want to be stuck in there. I'll probably wait for it to breath a little and see how the TikTok deal will goI think the ban would be regional i.e. IP level not apple store level.I appreciate the input, I'll buy for sure but not all inYeah set expectations and buy-ins low and forget about them so you can focus on buying more stocks listed above.I think it's reasonable that a Ford will double within the next two years. However I'm not confident about GE's ability to remain competitive long term.It‚Äôs a great start.Since he is talking about long-term, you need to pick businesses who have clear upside for next several years. DIS model will be under lots of pressure in the next few years. 

Disney is a 50-50 story for me right now, their streaming numbers were cooked up with FREE 1 year subscription for Verizon (including me) and theme parks /movie distribution going though rough patch (possible permanent changes).

Competitors like Netflix are much better.Both mutual funds and etfs act as and track indexes. Generally etfs are probably going to be better (cheaper) but if you have a very specific need or strategy (target date mutual) then it might make senseETFs are indexed as well, taxable account use ETFs, non taxable account really doesn‚Äôt matter except if you want the daily liquidity that ETFs provide>level 2act7472 points ¬∑ 1 hour agoWordReply

No, index funds is just a term for index based ETF like S&P 500 (IVV, SPY, VOO) or Nasdaq 100 (QQQ)QQQMSFT is going to drop in price if the sale of TikTok goes through.  They will have to spend billions in the acquisition.  It will hit their balance sheet and investors that read fundimentals will walk away for a period of time.I might also warn you that although you said you don't like to trade, I'm 90% certain stock is gonna surge a few days-week after stock split and then come back to earth for 1-2 weeks after before resuming business as normal.I understand. Thanks for the inputI do hope it goes down so I can buy em hahaI'll keep that in mindIf you‚Äôre worried about missing out, just slowly begin to make a position right now, and add to it once you feel confident in it again.I'm not worried. I have my charts ready. Just wanted to know the insights of experienced stock peopleNext to all that‚Äôs written here I have one thing in mind when I bought more shares lately. it‚Äôs the simple fact that his biggest holding is apple. It reached a new ATH and brk barely moved an inch. For me it‚Äôs investing in apple using a cheaper backdoor. I might be wrong but that was my intention to buy more brk next too a lot of apple in the past few month.He just did a pretty good size deal last month. He also increased his stake in BofA. He‚Äôs a fairly patient individual. I expect him to make another move. I expect it to grow long term. $209 with 4.5 PE looks good. Wish I had bought it in the 170s, but I had all sorts of doubt in my head at the time.Wow. Look at the track record. Does anyone here have a better track record than Warren Buffett? No. So, take all these comments with a grain of salt. 

The arrogance of some the critical comments here are outstanding.I bought a bunch at 178. I wanted to buy more, but my limit order never went through as the stock soared recently. I think that this recession is gonna bring the Oracle of Omaha out of his hibernation and use some of his huge cash position.Not as hyped. When market experiences a correction, B is not as affected as Voo etc.

He believes is keep some cash, lots of bond as cushion.  The real experienced investor feels cash can be good investment if there are not many good stocks to invest,Go with the BEST. Forget the rest.YesEarnings tomorrow gonna boomBuffett is more of a spectator these days and his top lieutenants are running the show. Berkshire operates wide moat boring companies that will give them a reasonable rate of return. That‚Äôs it. I am not impressed with its stock portfolio. It has underperformed S&P over the last few years and is only being propped up by AAPL. KraftHeinz, WFC, and the airline stakes were disasters. It‚Äôs sad to say but I think Buffett‚Äôs nostalgia about certain companies taints his objectivity. He recalled wistfully in an interview recently that when he used to work at a grocery store in 1941, customers would come and demand Heinz brand ketchup. So he probably had it in his head his whole life that he needed to buy into that company. He loves his Coke. Take a look at the KraftHeinz and Coke brands.. Do those inspire you in 2020? They sell junk food that today‚Äôs consumers avoid like the plague.If you look at an actuarial table, there is at least a 25% chance that Warren and/or Chrlie will die over the next 12 months based on their age. That doesn't even take Covid into account. Do you think people will hold BRK.B after Warten is gone? The entire stock is based on a cult of personality....no. Berkshire investing that ungodly sum of money to BoA is the biggest boondoggle of all time. It will be YEARS before you see any significant profit.Brk is about 50% Apple and Amazon then 50% value stocks. To me that's not one thing or another. The growth vs value portfolio kind of cancels each other out. If you want growth then buy faangs and stick with them. In a growth market Brk won't beat the S&P. In a prolonged value market.. which hasn't happened in years then it maybe fine but if you are long term investor then I think investing in just Brk you are leaving money on the table.yeah, I like it's huge exposure to Apple, but that stock has gone insane. I think Berkshire is really undervalued for it's holdings, but I also think it'll be heavily impacted when Apple corrects, since it's such a large holding.50 year track record, sure. 10 year track record? No so muchCash is pointless and causes drag on performance. Bonds pay you to wait, then can be sold when buying opportunities arise in stocks (down markets), also known as ‚Äúrebalancing‚Äù.üôÑRemindme! One yearThere is a difference. Warren is concerned with buying large stakes in companies that make money, not predicting what stocks are going to the moon. It's a boring, but profitable company>Do those inspire you in 2020?

Do you think people stopped buying ketchup?That‚Äôs a fair point.Well the cult of personality combined with their tremendous track record, insane cash position, and huge position in AAPL.You can say that about tsla, but Berkshire can back up its value with its actual holdings.Even if you were right about this, BoA stock still makes up a pretty small proportion of the companies total value. So the idea that it will be years before OP sees a significant profit based solely on this one fact is absurd.If only Berkshire was like ark investments on steroids scooping up cloudflare Shopify before they 10x instead of banks and airlinesActually it‚Äôs mostly Geico,l.
Brk is not only their stock portfolio.
They have a huge insurance business and probably other subsidiaries.Don‚Äôt know why people downvoted this comment but it‚Äôs true.  Buffett has underperformed the S&P for many years now and has completely missed out on the tech boom with the exception of investing heavily into AAPL.  As much as I admire and respect Buffett for all that he has contributed to the investing community, his investing philosophy does not perform well in the current market environment.Rooney, you comment like you are mentally challengedWhen you get flak on r/stocks, you are doing something very wrong lolI will be messaging you in 1 year on [**2021-08-08 12:00:48 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2021-08-08%2012:00:48%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i5sowo/is_brk_b_undervalued_right_now/g0s5rhv/?context=3)

|-|-|-|-|Irrelevant question. Growth is the name of the game. Let me throw a question back at you.. How much more market penetration for ketchup can there be?But it's not solely on this. Banks are a HORRIBLE investment in the short/medium-term. BoA, JPM, all of them aren't expected to rebound for at least another year.

Two important points here: One, Buffett can last that long and invest $2.1 billion while OP probably can't/shouldn't. Two, if the OP truly wanted to invest in something now while seeing returns now while also sitting back watching those returns compound he is better off using his limited funds on ITM $SPY calls. Quite literally, depending on his funds, he could buy a handful of November, December, and January contracts. Sit back and do NOTHING. BoA is "undervalued" just like a thousand and one other (better) companies but at least they can provide tangible returns now plus they won't glue you to your Think or Swim watching a volatility roller coaster for 12-18 months.

Buffett is gambling on the banks making a rebound which they ABSOLUTELY will but let's be perfectly honest here: this play only works because of his MASSIVE CAPITAL and absolutely has nothing to do with his wisdom in the ins/outs of BoA. Using that logic EVERYTHING (excluding penny stock bullshit) will eventually rebound! All you should care about is what is going to rebound NOW and what will get you compounded returns NOW. BoA will not consistently do that.

Berkshire is therefore not doing itself any favors in this investment even if it makes up a small-ish portion in it's portfolio. The market reacts to news, however insignificant all the time. Look at $TSLA.üôÑI'll throw in a question too. How many years did value outperform growth over the past 100, 50, or even 25 years? 

Much greater than half. When your entire investing history is based on a 10 year bull market, it's easy to think you're a genius by picking growth stocks.> Growth is the name of the game. Let me throw a question back at you.. How much more market penetration for ketchup can there be?

Berkshire grows by acquiring new companies. Sure, growth in existing segments is great and hoped for, but they can sit back and collect cash from companies like Sea's Candy to bolster their coffers while looking for new investments.My point is that OP isn't asking about investing in BAC. They are asking about investing in BRK. BAC stock makes up rough 2-3% of BRK's total value. So no matter how long it takes the BAC investment to make a profit it will have very little effect on the stock price of BRK.Financials are one of the best current purchases for buy and hold investors, because they are so much cheaper than peak, and tech has gotten so insanely overpricedHey, cuntI should clarify--by "growth" I meant rate of return. I don't necessarily mean that you have to be in what is classified as "growth stocks." I buy a combination of growth and value, which is why I index with VTI and add individual stocks that I am particularly confident in. I just don't like *enough* of Berkshire's subsidiaries and stock portfolio *over* my approach.

Another aspect of this is that Berkshire is so big that shifts in strategy are slow to execute. In this regard, the retail investor like you and I have the advantage.Yes, I know. But my point is that BRK makes short/medium-term moves, such as the acquisition of large portions of BAC stock, that simply will not return investments in a timely manner regardless if it is "undervalued".Ohhh, heard. I agree with all your points, though I do have a chunk of Berkshire in my portfolio.I don't understand why you are classifying the BAC purchase as a short/medium move. Most moves by BRK are long term plays. Especially when it is just a standard stock buy.I'm not calling it a short/medium move (quite the opposite). I am saying this move has no short/medium term BENEFITS for OP relative to other plays he COULD be making, namely SPY.So what? It doesn't matter if one specific move involving a small percentage of value of BRK doesn't provide short term value. BRK owns a wide variety of assets. The other assets will provide short term value that outweighs the bad short term value stocks more often than not.

I could make the exact same argument you are making against the S&P. I guarantee at least 2% of S&P stocks provide bad short term value at any given time. Probably much more.Don‚Äôt think of it as regular options vs the more exotic variety. Straddles, butterfly spreads, iron condors, etc are all just some combination of plain old calls and puts. You should learn them for sure, but don‚Äôt feel like you need to do some 4 legged strategy on every play. But you don‚Äôt even really need to know the names as long as you know what each leg is doing. For example, so you don‚Äôt know if the stock will go up or down but you know it‚Äôs gonna move? Well buy a call and a put. Congrats you just did a straddle. But you also think you think the stock will only rise to the 50 day moving average or only fall as low as the 200 day moving average? So sell a call and put at those boundaries and now you did a butterfly spread.That's a little like asking, "I only know the missionary position. Is sex dead?" ;)

You use the strategy that best fits the market opportunity and goals of the trade. I personally trade XSP long calls all the time. But I also have Wheels and credit spreads going all the time also. Variety keeps the sex life spicy, as they say.you can definitely do that but I think people just prefer having risk defined strategies with lower entry costs

example: you wanna play amzn but dont have 16k? debit spread is only 200 bucks and you're guaranteed 500 if it goes up to your short call

if you pay a 16k reg call, yes you can potentially triple it but you need to worry about iv, theta, and all that. just makes things easier if it's a spreadHell no.

The truth is simple -- most people don't have any edge trading directionally, so they sell instead.Yes and no. Buying options have there are place but i think for the most part selling i think is the way to go long term. The problem with buying options is that you have theta decay working against you from the start. When you sell options such as iron condor, credit spreads you can benefit from theta decay. Learning on how to sell options is definitely a good skill to learn. Check out option alpha.com they have a ton of free videos to watch to get you started learning how to sell optionsUse option profit calculator, when you don't understand something, try it and see how you can limit risks with different combinations 

 [https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/put-spread.html](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/put-spread.html)Thank youCan you please link a solid video explaining credit and debit spreads and the difference between them?My main fear with selling options is if somebody decide to exercise the option and then I'm forced to buy 100 shares of it.Go to projectoption, use search in the YT channel. For example:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTZv7z2T_hE

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZrMhrmhDCQI watch https://www.youtube.com/c/projectoption a lot, I feel like he does a pretty good job at explaining things on an understandable level. He has a video for almost every "basic" spread (put debit/credit, call debit/credit, and iron condor). He also does videos on the basics and greeks.That is a valid fear most people talk about and a risk that needs to be thought about. Although getting assigned stocks happens it dosen‚Äôt happen often. Most options are not excercised i don‚Äôt have the exact numbers though. One thing you can do by reducing assignment risk is by closing out your trades BEFORE they expire even if you may make a few extra dollars it is worth it to close the trade out. I linked a great video that can explain it better than I can 

[Options assignment vid](https://youtu.be/evPqoulbxHs)Already having 100 shares (or short 100 shares) solves that problem.Just goes to show that no one really knows what's going to happen. We're all in a guessing gamei think the initial shock of it is over so we'll not drop as much againLmao tiedWhere‚Äôs the third option of ‚Äúwho the fuck knows‚Äùi don't think we'll hit march lows againSPX 3600 at year-end 2020

You're welcome.Not 35 to 40 percent like March when there was a lot of uncertainty around the pandemic and a lockdown of the economy. There won't be another complete lockdown in the US ie Florida , Arizona and Texas no lockdown despite a spike  ,  there  may be 10 percent drop , which wont be too bad I can buy more.  I am about 20 percent over my precovid Feb high anyway so it won't hurt too much.  Investors have money now and everyone is waiting to get in if there is a crash there will be a major buying spree launching the market back to ATH very quickly V like April May Juneflip a coinIn October. It's always October.Whatever happened to the fight over oil prices with the Saudis?Second wave could be a second small drop but I think the election could result in something more significant. And I have no clue what the results would mean to the market it's that messed up.

Obviously not 30% but still significant.A big drop but it doesn‚Äôt have to be big as the March one I guess is what I‚Äôm asking what people thinkYou will come to find "who the fuck knows" will be the resulting answer when this poll ends. It'll be pretty close to 50/50Gotta choose one hahaJust buy ~~VRGO~~ WTFKDo you think 20% drop would be a realistic event by the end of the year?Second wave is already happening in the US and Canada, the EU, and the rest of the world is getting worse. But since things move at such a slow pace, things are not as crazy as it used to be.I‚Äôm waiting on November to switch over into USD someone tell me if I‚Äôm being stupid considering we‚Äôre already 80 cents on the dollarWon't be anything close to march too much money pouring in from retail and institutional investors . US Fed also buying corporate bonds and ETFs . Don't fight the Fed, sorry to all the people who panic sold in march and April or missed out buying into this massive rally .Ahh fineWhat would be the catalyst nothing is affecting the market right now investors are buying fed is printing . Let's see there is a Covid spike in the southern US (no lockdown ) , civil  unrest after Floyd killing , trade and diplomatic  tension between us and china , election jitters , record unemployment and the stock market is soaring .  Nothing short of another complete lockdown  of the US  economy (which will never happen) again would cause that kind of drop and even then it may be questionable. Sorry if you have cash waiting to get in but if you missed March I don't think an opportunity like that will come again for a while .This also falls in the category of "who knows!" It's such a difficult time to judgeHow about a 20% drop?I‚Äôve invested most of my cash already but just curious on what people think**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

Fundamentally, this is an over-reaction. Tencent's wechat business in the united states accounts for a very very small percentage of their revenue. This is because wechat's payment processor doesn't really accept foreign cards (in theory it does, but its super limited and isn't practical for payment purposes).I don't think fundamental approach would make sense to try and arrive at a 50bn figure. 

Part of tencents valuation was probably its ability to expand globally (including US), so its not just current revenue streams but also less certainty about future ones.Chinese stocks, and stocks in general from export heavy nations suffer when tensions between China and America rise due to the possibility of something like Tik Tok, Wechat happening.The question is if this applies to games. If only WeChat is affected this barely means anything for Tencent as the app has no significant presence in the US. If the restrictions were extended to games however this would hurt Tencent pretty badly.

Apparently games are not meant to be included but the phrasing of the order is vague enough and the administration clearly is on the warpath with Chinese companies.Trying to do fundemental analysis on Tencent without an army is futile at best and arrogant at worst.

Stay away from the stock..there are more transparent opportunities.Just panic selling, I slurped up some shares at the end if day. It'll be back no problem. I slurped up some Facebook 50 dollars ago that day people panic sold cause of boycotts lmaoTencent also owns games that are very popular in the US such as League of Legends and FortniteNot well versed in this but do you know if the ban is only a ban on transactions over the WeChat platform or is the US flat out banning the entire app?

Because while the presence is small, bankers, lawyers and accountants that work with Chinese client in the US do use WeChat. If it is just banning transactions, then it shouldn‚Äôt affect the communication part of WeChat.Correct, but those have not been targeted. It is specifically tencent's Wechat business. 

From what i have read on news articles, they are specifically targeting wechat. So Wechat will not be allowed to list in the US app stores. I have read some clarifications that they are not targeting the video games business, but just random articles in chinese, nothing from potus himself.Just a blip! Think long term not short term gains! It‚Äôs not the end of the world, you have your whole life ahead of you to make worthwhile investments! It could always be a lot worse! Also remember the difference between gambling and investing! 

Take care.You had a taste of gains but when you're trading short term options it's just not sustainable. Sounds like you just lost the houses money so to speak, so honestly it could be much worse.

The greatest investors have always said the same thing, buy companies that you expect to grow earnings and revenues over the next decade and HOLD them. The more you research the companies and competitors the "luckier" you get. This is a great learning experience and is a stronger lesson than anything someone could tell you because it hurts.Check out wallstreetsbets. Youll Be in good company and loved thereYea cash account if you are below 25k to avoid pdt. TD has like $.75 fee on every options trade (buy and sell). You should lie on the form just to make sure you get access to higher options trading levels lolBuy far out options in the money calls-  you won‚Äôt see explosive gains overnight but there are still undervalued companies out there poised for steady growth that could net you a few hundred a day. The higher cost to open such contracts would force you to narrow down your lineup and also to do proper due diligence in the selection(s).

It‚Äôs a bad day, not a bad life!Please don't make the mistake that many are making and put stop losses. Enter back again when the market starts the new rally with the stimulus announcement. Till then it will be a downward slideI had to learn the hard way too. Now I force myself to be patient and react to what I see in the market and don't often act on what I expect to see. I also cut way down on the number of different companies I trade. I now trade no more than 4 different commodities and companies, dedicated myself to learning how they move and do my research in advance. The weekend is particularly good for getting your head right and scouting out some plays in advance. Wish you the best of luck, I eventually won back my gains after getting completely crushed and going down to less than half of my initial investment at some point. Learned valuable lessons.i started with 12k, was down -75% (2 weeks ago) (lost moeny, made it in the crash, lost it in the rally) and i'm now at 20k (gold monthlies + gold debit spreads and ostk calls)

if you play it smart, you can make it all back

oh and to avoid pdt, convert your winners/losers into spreadsJust wait on Monday, if you are holding solid stocks, don't worry, it eventually will go up if the US economy doesn't crash. Pass it to you children 

But if you are holding options, think about the extrinsic valueYou sound like a guy who wants people to encourage their gambling problem. And you are even one of the lucky ones, as you just blew your gains and not everything. 
It gives the impression that you lack maturity.
Be careful which path you tread.You should watch the movie ‚ÄúWall Street.‚Äù  Just take a load off and watch a movie and chill for tonight.I always ask myself "would an idiot make this trade?". If the answer is yes, I do not make that trade.>I also think it was a brutal day in the market so I should see a bounce Monday.

Well, it was a brutal day for tech anyway. The S&P was flat, financials and many industrials did great. 

You'll be back. At least you didn't lose anything you couldn't afford to, and you learned some new lessons.That‚Äôs gonna suck for tax time right?Get 1 contract and follow thru. You are throwing dots all over.I love youTry figuring out what you fucked up before trying again.

In case it isnt clear :Try reallly fucking hard.I started with $360 for trading and away from my actual investments and quickly went up to over $2k with some guidance from a couple friends. I decided to get out on my own knowing next to nothing and wasted most of it down to about $200. After taking a week break, my play account is back over $3k in 2 days. It happens to all of us. I'm new to options but have had some good luck with BAC and GLD calls. Take a breath. Drink a beer. Hit a joint. Don't trade when you're in a funk, bro. You'll come back.Why did you even buy something when you know you don‚Äôt have any day trades left? Get cash account first. Move out of RH if that is what you are using, It gets stuck frequently and you end up holding the contracts. I know it‚Äôs a simple UI but if you are into options you should mpve away. And if you are using RH to avoid small fees, you shouldn‚Äôt even trade options.Dont worry, it takes some experience to time the market properlyThank you. Was doing a lot closer to gambling with some recently. I am relatively young I can make it back but dang I will have a lot less to build with in the short term.Thank you, need to have some patience with longer term positions, told myself I‚Äôd do that when I grew my portfolio.I intentionally did not go thereLOL STOPYeah I was going to change to cash account but cash doesn‚Äôt settle so can‚Äôt use it until the next day but probably would have saved me.Thanks it was actually more long swinging options in this chop that killed me, but I screwed myself today with the options expiring today. The price moves so fast. IYep I should have just transferred it all over and waited for it. Oh well still time.Thanks that‚Äôs what happened to me with Google, didn‚Äôt know how it moved. Roku I knew how it moved and still got caught in 2 bull traps. Oh well.Congrats, hoping I can make a similar recovery :) I know it‚Äôs possible 

Can you explain what you mean convert into spreads? Is this ‚Äòrolling it up‚Äô - I am switching to TOS for reference.Thanks mostly options. Visa, FB BYND, AAL, ROKUI have definitely done that, or rushed in following a trader without a thoughtThanks, I had more cash in there than I wanted to but at least I‚Äôm not at zeroNot sure what you mean, it‚Äôs not a net gain yet so capital gains tax does not applyI have had too many open positions that‚Äôs for sure.I love you bothThanks, just impatient.Lol good call. But it sounds like your gambling, not investing.  

Good news is that theres a whole life of investing in front of you. Slow and steady wins the race. Its not sexy, but if fuckin works!

80% investing. 20% options/gambling.

Thats my strategy and when i lose a bunch in the 20%, i dont refill from then 80%... be committed to investing, not gambling.


For every 10 you move from savings to your broker... 8 to investing, 2 to gambling. Separate the accoutns too! Makes it easier to keep your investments safe and always feel confident that your net worth is climbing!

Best of luckTrade half of your account each day, also you can still exit positions you just cant buy without any settled fundsThanks I love all of you I appreciate itJesus love y'allYou likely wont get to your max profit unless you hold to expiration and your strikes both stay ITM.

I'd say if you are happy with your profit and don't mind missing out on that last percentage of possible gain you should sell.
I try to sell if I'm anywhere around 60-80% max profit, alot of tines even earlier if I'm happy with the gain.Same answer as any position: if the expected value of the position tomorrow is greater than the value today, you hold. Otherwise you exit.Usually, rolling defined risk spreads isn't worth the headache. Let it ride to experation and it could come back. Open a new spread further out in time if you're looking to recover that first trade.Yes, you can collect theta from the time value decay on your short strike.

In my experience, it's wise to close the spread when it goes your way, and not try to collect all the theta, unless you think the short strike will remain totally out of play.

Kind of a "the perfect is the enemy of the good" sort of situation. But the answer to your question is "yes."Do you ever roll debit spreads or is that more of a credit spread strategy? Dope username btwEveryone should be required to memorize and recite this before they are allowed to trade anything.I actually just rolled over a debit spread today/yesterday. 

Had 23/26 sept debits on SLV that I rolled over to 40/45 spreads for january.

(Closed the 9/18 spreads at 1.25 and opened the 1/15s at 0.38)Well, a call debit spread is the same position as a put credit spread with the same strikes. If you would roll that short put spread then you can roll this one since they are the same.That much for slv? You baller, I‚Äôm inYea man thats a 1000% gain if SLV closes above 45 by 2021$45 is a bit of a strech, but I‚Äôll do $25/$35. Do bitch slap me in the face if you make that 1000% gain thoughI only did it that far out becuase I have 28/32 debit spreads already, but 25/35 is a solid play.I have a wealthsimple account for my retirement fund. I feed that every week without thought. Thats mostly made up of etfs

With extra cash I want to use to invest i throw it into my wealthsimple trade. This is my "fun stocks account". I like to have control and Im big on gambling so this quenches that thirst.

In my fun account I hold

XGRO (trying to be risky but safe at the same time)
XQQ (same)
XREI (I like realestate and its dividends, purchased recently and I like the low price I got in on)
SNU (I like that I can see the thing I own)
WELL (telehealth is the future)
HZU (been buying for the last two weeks)

Ill often funnel money I make from riskier picks into my etfs or more usually my retirement fund. 

I know this isnt textbook my anymeans but it works for me and my finances and my outlook on retirement has improved greatly since choosing this path.40% in XEQT, 35% in TEC and 25% divided between BAM, BMO, CP and ATD (which I will sell when it hits 52+)

I'm heading towards retirement (- 8 years) so over the next 5 years, I'll move most of my individual stocks into XEQT.

While I'm doing this I'll nibble into some individual small high tech stocks with my pocket change.As you said, I'm about 80% ETFs and 20% high-risk stocks which are mostly penny stocks.

ETFs: VFV/XSP, XIU, EDGE, TEC, ZPS.L

High-risk stocks: VERY (vegan industry), DOC (telehealth), FLT (drone delivery), CTS (tech), CUB (vertical farming), WLLW (synthetic biology), WVM (mining)

I say these are high-risks because they don't have a track record of stability just yet but I tend to choose companies that might do well in the future. I'm cool holding these for 5 -10 years. You have to do your own research though!I got MRU.ETFs in my  rrsp Vgt QQQ Arkw wcld 

Wife rrsp xntk , fdn , igv , Soxx 

My TFSA apple , MSFT , GOOG , amzn  adbe , v , ma , Nvidia 

Wife TFSA square , PayPal , xit , FB , AMD, CEF 

Portfolios been rocking all round not touching anything other then cef will sell if it shoots up not in my long term planARKK is  my YOLO RSP ETF.  My hugh risk plays are all leveraged ETF's. AGQ,UGL,HZU,HGU,HBU.NIO - On the NYSE. Chinese electric vehicle maker. Never heard anyone say a bad word about their products and they are poised to become the Tesla of China.

SUGR - Canadian marijuana stock. It's said that it's basically like the Walter White 99.9% pure meth in that it's the highest grade THC in the world. Ridiculously cheap right now because they've spent years and years building their grow facility and racking up debt and didn't have a product to sell, but they are FINALLY arriving in select stores in Saskatchewan and hopefully the rest of the country/world to follow if word gets around on how great it is.Nothing high-risk, mostly pretty blue chip-ish.  I have 11% in single stocks and about 3.5% in single REITs.

Of that 14.5%, about 5% is Brookfields, mostly in my TFSA (BAM.A, BIP.UN, BPY.UN).

A couple of things most people here won't have:  I have 1.7% in Illumina (ILMN).  It's up about 90% over its purchase price in 2015, but it's a long-term hold.  No dividend; pure growth.

I also have about 4% in Atrium Mortgage Investment Company (AI).  It's an equity but it spits out interest, as befits a MIC, so it belongs in a registered account.  It currently has an 8.6% distribution, which is attractive, but it's nonetheless tied to the mortgage market, so it's beat up a bit right now.  The share price is down 30% from its high earlier in the year.28 yo here, I'm about 70% in various tech stocks (tsla, amd, aapl, MSFT, amzn, Google, etc), 20% in banks or safer ETFS, and some 10% gamble money (in the red on oil/weed). Bought those banks in March, and will liquidate end of year to pay off the loan I used. XEQT and TEC/VGT are my usual scheduled biweekly buys, with rebalancing twice a year.

Another 10 years of tech boom would have me retire early, otherwise I plan on shifting more towards XEQT, and eventually shift that into fixed income 80% and 20% tech/XEQT for retirement with yearly rebalance.80% of TFSA in XGRO
20% of TFSA split between DKNG, MOZ.TO, PNG.VI made 20% profit on a 30 minute trade of TOY.TO the other day (bought at closing on the 5th, sold shortly after open on 6th). Other things I've swung include LSPD, Aritzia, and inverse oil ETFs. I keep 90% of my portfolio in safe ETFs, and only gamble the remaining 10%. For example, that TOY purchase was only 10k, and swung for 2k profit. Whereas I have 45k in VFV alone.This doesnt sound all that fun. XGRO in the fun account ?Bro.. xgro, xqq don‚Äôt count as a gambling by any means.. people throw their entire life savings into those etfs. People often argue robo advisor‚Äôs fees are too high and would rather go with ETFs (like xgro or dare I say xeqt) 


Go on wall street bets and see what gambling really is.Is this all in your TSFA? Or how do you decided which investments for which accounts?I'm new, and going to apologize if this is a dumb question. But what ETFs are you holding in your retirement fund? XGRO gets recommended a lot as a safe all in one but you're holding it in your 'fun' account.This. 

Buying xgro in a ‚Äúfun/gambling‚Äù account is like going to the casino and playing 1 cent slots all night.I didnt see any risky bets I liked for a while so bought those. Lately ive been liking silver and grabbing HZU which is pretty risky.Wondering too. My retirement fund *is* XGRO.I use wealthsimple on risk 7

I have lived a very fast life full of lots of risk for a long time. Im 35 and have been investing for about a year and a half. I havent been the smartest with my money but me and my fiance do have an investment condo in Toronto and I have pension thru work. 

I have an automatic deposit into my wealthsimple weekly and thats my retirement. I cant screw it up. Its on risk level 7. I only give it a good look a few times a year. 

I use this other account for "fun". I sometimes have  money left over in my budget that I want to invest. If i dont have a big hunch ill use XGRO as a place to park the money. It feels good to make a resonable investment. 

Ive got more "risky" with the reits and WELL and Im grtting my love of gambling thru HZU. 

I know this a weird way to run my finances but it works for me and Im on track to be much better off than I was a year and a half ago.Ive lost thousands of dollars on division 2 Norwegian soccer before breakfast in my past life. I like to keep things pretty tame in my life today.Just out of curiosity. What‚Äôs your average growth on wealthsimple level 7 risk?**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*If you are using market orders then you are going to see bad fills like this.I could be wrong, but I think when you‚Äôre trading fractions you‚Äôre really in a pool within that brokerage. E.g. schwab has 1 share and they hold it for xx people. If that is correct then you‚Äôre not really on the open market, the transactions will float the spot price but not guaranteed to reach it.Buy with a limit order or don't buy.  A market order will ensure that some one else is getting the better part of the deal.Fidelity has been pretty good so far on fractional shares and you can set a limit prices.Robinhood has fractional shares for some members. I haven‚Äôt had any problems with it so farThis is why I hate fractional shares. You can't buy or sell it at a limit price; only market. Does anybody know the reason behind this limitation?How many shares did you get?Yeah, that's the benefit for them to offer the service. It gives more access to smaller investors, which is a good thing. Wait for a pull back or pick stocks that are down already.Interactive Brokers lets you use limit orders with fractional shares. They also let you buy any stock with fractions and not just the S&P 500 ones.

Fidelity might too, though I haven‚Äôt tried there.Fuck fractional shares, just another way for these companies to screw you imo.It stinks. I try to always use limit orders but also like to use stock slices to follow the DCA approach.You are correct. I was just taken away that the stock never even got within 1% of the price I ended up getting it atAgreed, although setting a limit order which never ends up executing is possibly the most annoying thing in the worldUntil the price goes up in 5 minutes.how do you place your limit orders?So far Robinhood has been my next experience with fractional shares. SoFis stockbits are a fucking joke. Only execute during some limited ass window and I think it's 3:30 pm EST.When it comes to most brokers, all orders, whether you‚Äôre selling or buying are typically handled by market makers. Brokerages simply route your order to the MM. 

When you‚Äôre trying to buy/sell fractional shares, the brokerage is now acting as a ‚Äúmarket maker‚Äù, so the rules of the game change a little.Brokers will buy a bunch of shares for everyone wanting fractional shares then divide the price amongst the buyers and sellers on their platform. I think they raise the price a little too for a small commission. 

The broker holds the shares but shows your part ownership in your positions.Just .25. I put in 1000$ over 10 stocksOh thats really awesome actually. I've never actually heard of that one. I just knew fidelity, schwab, TD, Etrade, and Robinhood. Thanks for the suggestionFidelity does allow you to put limit orders on fractional, but they don‚Äôt allow GTC which is a drag.If your broker supports it, then it should be an option at the buy screen.Interesting. Did not know the broker bought the shares in the open market first. Explains why only the popular stocks are available for fractional trading..25 if thats what they round to could be from 392.16 to 408.16.

I also have no idea if fractional shares follow the same rules for NBBO since they're a brokerage feature and not an exchange tradeable amount AFAIK+1 for IBKR. If you are in the US they also offer IBKR lite.lmao i know how to place a limit order, just wondered what percentage you use, if anyNBBO is only for round lots, so no order for less than 100 shares needs to follow NBBO.If you want the order to complete quickly, you can put the order in for a few pennies below the current quoted price.  If you are willing to wait, you can go a few percentage points down to try and catch a dip in the price.For more info I had a bunch of options I was selling expiring today, maybe that messed something up?If you were selling options did they get exercised?YupHow do I know if they got exercisedLet‚Äôs come back to this moment in a couple of years....In a year, it won't matter. This is a quality long-term hold that will eventually go far above the price that you bought it for.8/14 TDOC 237.5c...

Down 70% 

I'm buying crackhead 40oz malt liquor tonight and drowning the painI too am holding the LVGO bag and my wife is holding me[deleted]I wished the merger announcement would have happened after the ER.I looked at TDOC, but decided against investing in it. I don't understand why insurance companies won't just build their own telehealth portals and keep it in house and save big $ long term? Something to consider. Hope I am wrong and you make hundreds of % profit, although.I think as long as anyone stays long in LVGO or TDOC they will make out great on this. I doubled up my TDOC position today while it‚Äôs a little low right now. This combined company is going to to dominate the telemedicine space in my opinion.18.5BHi my fellow brethren. Atleast I bought LVGO shares when it was 70... Remember the when LVGO was 166? i member.... I was like holy moly, went online to see the merger and it went back to see 150 in a matter of seconds... After some decent research and reasoning I decided to buy shares of TDOC. Cathie wood buying 90 million dollar worth of tdoc shares encouraged me greatly. Hope we moon bro... glBetter cut your losses at 14% than at 40% imoCheers mate, we are in it together. I bought with the intention of holding. Regardless I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh at my own timing. Heres to hoping we are sitting on a small sliver of what is to become the largest player in digital healthcare ü•ÇEarnings looked great on LVGO and TDOC... my intention was to grab more stock before the Q2 and then BAM, merger... if anything the announcement overshadowed a great quarter... if I wasn‚Äôt already so invested myself I‚Äôd be considering the value buy on the recent dipThe idea was to get into just LVGO because they have an effective and money saving product that just needed to be scaled... now outta nowhere I‚Äôm married to TDOC haha... I agree there will be fierce competition with out a doubt. Now I‚Äôm hoping TDOC has early entry and market share advantage to drive growth at least in the relative near term to save my play. But your right, god knows sharks are in the water... we simply can‚Äôt afford collectively to keep sending everyone to a face to face doc for every sniffle and boo boo. Someone‚Äôs gonna get those digital health dollars, for damn sure. God help me it‚Äôs TDOC üöÄüìàNopeThey have until 5:30PM I believe to exercise an option, so it's reasonableMost brokers auto exercise long options if they are ITM by $0.01 unless they are explicitly told not to. Also someone could have manually exercised when price dropped to 48 anticipating a larger draw down next week, or they simply wanted to get rid of their holdings to free up cash.There‚Äôs nothing that prevents someone from exercising the put. They may have an expectation that the stock moves lower next week so elect to dump it now.

The stock also briefly went below 48 a few times AH. This is a guess, but maybe you were automatically exercised at one of those times.I see... appreciate the replies.  Not a big deal, I wanted to own Intel anyways but was hoping to play the wheel game a little longer.  For whatever reason, I thought you only had 15min to exercise after hours.Given the data breach I can understand why someone wouldn't want to hold it over the weekend.  Who knows what may come out next.

An option buyer can excersize their option at anytime and at any price of the underlying.  They also have about an hour  after market close to make a decision.This is the correct answer.Um... Getting assigned is part of the wheel game, right?So the "free up capital for Monday" is the most likely argument?Yes let me clarify.  It was a stock I wanted for a long term hold.  I just wanted to sell weeklies for a little longer and maybe try to get it at $47 or $46 while getting a little premium.  I can probs get away with selling calls though as I don't see it recovering in the near future.It‚Äôs delisted from the tsx as of Thursday . It should show up soon as a Nas traded stock in you portfolio.When self service doesn't work, call your broker.**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*JP was also a big part of the last silver bubble.- chart is going from lower left to upper rightWhat about dollar strength?

You don't believe it?They'll pop it when it suits them. Probably go back to shorting and buying on the cheap.What makes you believe in dollar strength?

Pre-election: Joe far ahead -> Donald will take some destabilizing actions, weak dollars

Joe close -> a likelihood of a second Donald term (tax cuts remain but more possible sabotage like the covid handling, more trade wars, worse relationship with EU allies), weak dollars

You believe in dollar bull because you expect a weak EU recovery?Dollar is dying.Most banks have neutral exposure. Especially with Dodd-Frank, there's no reason, or much ability, to make directional bets.I believe the other major currencies are as weak or more than the dollar. I believe soon we will see a lot of countries selling their gold reserves to pay for their expenses and debts.Why? Because jpow printer meme? You realize the USA can export dollars? Countries with shit currencies use dollars. Fucking Cambodia uses USD. I'm sure Jerry and the gang have a plan for this. Probably CashApp 10 trillion to Phnom Penh.While they are printing alot, the inflation is still very low and have crashed since covid started. What do you think is going to happen once people start spending instead of just hoarding/saving? The effect will be the opposite. The previous dump for usd was for the printing, the next one will be fast increasing inflation.

While 2/3 of the tx's today are in dollar, it wasn't long ago the british pound was the reserve currency. The USD is not as attractive as it once was. China have been manipulating the USD to stay up for years too.

Ont: Long silver since february for the reason of JPM's manipulation but for the sake of currency risks too./r/povertyfinanceThat feeling when middle class is synonymous with povertyHoldingYes. Sell all of it so I can buy it.If you had bought before the post March speculation and believe in the company, then hold. I still don't understand why it went 5x even compared to Feb valuation.It did this like a month ago and bounced back, granted there wasn't the big issue with tik tok. Fastly seems to be a pretty solid company and would be good as a long term investment. I'm currently holding because I'm kicking myself the last time I panic sold a stock.I bought in yesterday.Panic. In may it was $21 a share, you're out of your mind if you think in 5 months it somehow deserved a 350% increase.Man this tec run is going to bleed so many souls. All Tec stocks have had crazy bull runs and are trading at like 2-3x pre-march levels and people go pikachu face when one of them go down 10%? Really? Valuations will eventually take over in the long-term. If FSLY is actually worth something, it will be up in 5 years. Stop investing in tec just because it's on a run. That's how you wake up to a 20% loss. Invest in solid companies with solid LONG-TERM growth. Not temporary growth because of social distancing. Don't go pouring all your savings into zoom.MSFT has 45 days to come to an agreement.

I think Trump will forget about TikTok in a week or so. It should bounce and hold $90 when that happensI bought at $20 and I'm holding in my non retirement account. I didn't have it in my Roth IRA so I bought a little the last 2 days. Also loaded up on NET just incaseWcld is a safer optionAlways hold - when you're thinking about selling due to price movement. Don't. People wanted to sell the most during March - the worst time.I cut my losses and put them into NET - already recovered 6%people out here would really still be shook if a stock took a 4 billion percent run and then went red -.0000000005% 2 days in a row.It's current valuation is largely speculation, even after this drop. You either had a strategy and are in it for the long haul or constantly anxiety ridden because you never imagined it would go down.WTF despite a huge drop its Price to Sales is over 40. its 52 week low is 10.63. So even with this drop its numbers are crazy high from its low. its 3 month low is 22.74. I think it will go down more before bouncing back. 

But if you believe in the company long term just hold on. you could buy puts to cover for downside but that will be very expensive for a volatile stock.Buy more friend. This company will be worth double in less than a year. Save this.in 10 years they'll definitely probably be back at $110From $110 level? Definitely time to panic. 
From $90? There is a chance.Holdor!Agreed. I got in under $25. Not even hesitant about holding long term.Same, i bought it today at $77 lolIf msft buys it. Surely they will use azure for all their needs.What do you mean by Trump will forget about TikTok? He already signed the executive order that bans it in 45 days. The order will only be stopped if Trump wants it to.Tik tok will sue to block order, and it will be stuck with the courtsAnd now it's the best time to sell, because it's gone on an insane run.Thats because those are the bagholders who bought at top while the people who bought it low dumping their bag onto them.What‚Äôs the ps for shop?SavedAnother retard. This sub really sucks. Peace out.This makes zero sense. So you are saying the stock will only go up to 110 and then it plateaus there. Idiot logic.How comparable is Azure to fastly thoughPeople act like this move to azure is going to be immediate and instant. This process to move to azure takes months if not years. You‚Äôre not just picking up a house and driving it 2 feet over. 

Also it‚Äôs 12% of their revenue from tiktok. That‚Äôs a size able chunk, but for a growing business is this really that scary?Shit, yes you're right

Didn't really think about that.

Idk if I should dump it or what. I have a GTC stop order at my purchase price so I guess I'll just hold it and see what happens62+. Its crazy overvalued but their sales growth have been much better than FSLY. During last quarter they grew 97.3%. Plus they competed with AMZN and beat them. 

Still all these companies are crazy overvalued. I definitely see a big correction coming across the sector. May be post COVID or overall market when Biden wins the election.this sub really doesn't know how to take a joke.I‚Äôm saying that if I bought it at $90 and it dropped 10% I would be fine with it. If I bought at $110 and it dropped  30% I would be selling off some. This is an opinion post/question and not stock market fundamentals discussion. Idiot logic or not, it‚Äôs mine.It doesn't matter because if msft buys tik tok, they'll make them use azure. But to compare, fsly focuses on speed and azure is relatively new to that part of the game.It's not the fact that it will take so long to migrate over. It's the fact that it is inevitable. So the stock price will reflect that. 

The 12% is significant because you would assume that you would grow with that customer. Now that you count out that growth and revenue, you're moving forward but taking a few steps back before you restart.MARKETS ARE FORWARD LOOKING.I'm in at $20 and sold more than half my holdings at $90ish. I got super lucky because I got on the cdn train before it all mooned. Ddog, fsly, and netBuy high sell low. ü§îI got in at 75 when they dipped about a month ago. But I should have bought it after their last earnings, then I'd have altitude to hold it for a whileMaybe you‚Äôve heard of ‚Äúcut your losses‚Äù concept ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èHmmm. So your advice on March 24th , when the S&P was down 36% would have been ...Sell, cut your losses‚Äù. 

Somehow I think that would not have been good advice. üôÑYes. Use a real brokerage.pretty sure you cant prevent that :(No, it's company policy for RH to lock in your losses like that, even though they make sure you can handle the max loss before even opening a trade.

So yes, you'll want to move to another broker.On the disclaimer page they have, it states they will close your position about an hour before close if you don't have the funds in your account to exercise.

I believe the only way around it is to actually be able to exercise what you buy.I got screwed too. I had a debit spread which has no risk of default and it was closed early when it would have ended in the money and I lost a good bit. Not happy.Yes, have sufficient cash to own the stock.  
Or alternatively, close the trade by noon on expiration day (eastern time).  

TOS will also dispose of your position if near the money, and you cannot buy the stock.This just happened to me today as well. RH bought to close the credit spread portion of my $93-$98 iron condor on AMD for $36 while the stock was trading under my short strike. I only got $20 credit for the condor so this left at a loss, even though by market close AMD was above my short put so I would've been fine üôÉMissed the boat on that one.It‚Äôs probably better for you to take out a HELOC.

It will be easier for you to track and keep the funds separate from your mortgage. This way it will be easier for you to deduct the interest when invested in a taxable account, in an income producing investment.I'm doing this with an unsecured line of credit. As it's leveraged money, I'm trying to be cautious by going with Canadian Banks and averaging 5.8% in annual dividends. There are a number of other types of shares paying upwards of 10-12% in annual dividends, but seem riskier to me.

If you do it through a line of credit rather than extracting equity when you renew your mortgage, the interest you pay on your investment becomes a tax deduction. I think someone in an earlier thread called it the Smith maneuver. There's apparently an additional tax break on dividend income from Canadian companies.

I've done some modeling on this and with dividend reinvestment, and hopefully dividend growth, you will hopefully be making substantially more 5-7 years out on your dividends.I think, that's it, the Smith Maneuver!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*You are looking at this wrong.  Covid is a positive thing for gaming sales, people are actually saving money by not going out as much and they can justify spending more on a console because at home entertainment is much more important.  
  
Microsoft's strategy is better than Sony's, but due to brand loyalty many people will buy Sony's console and games.  
  
Microsoft will be a good buy in the next 5 years.  I really don't see anything that will (long-term) cause problems for Microsoft.  They are integrated in everything tech, other than physical hardware, their pricing on entreprise solutions is massive, but everyone buys it regardless because of the value it provides.  
  
Sony, I personally look at as a hardware company, I don't personally invest in them or see a lot going for them to provide significant growth.  I'm sure their numbers are likely good, just I personally don't have any interest in any of their products which is a red flag to me given the size of the company and their brand recognition.  Might need to do more research on them but I don't have any FOMO on investing in them.You're viewing Microsoft as a console company, which they are not. 
They're better categorized as a conservative, cloud based hosting provider, who services the gaming community. They're a longstanding juggernaut in B2B, security, and workplace productivity. They also have a long term interest in social apps, LinkedIn, but potentially purchasing rights to TikTok, either domestically (US) or globally. 
They're closer to AAPL than ATVI. 
Change your thinking, they are a great long term holdMicrosoft is drinking from the corporate/institutional money faucet by providing enterprise software and services. Find me an office worker that doesn't use Word, Excel, or receive their email through MS Exchange on the daily. If they don't sell a couple more XBones this year, they will be ok.https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-07-22-microsofts-gaming-revenues-jump-in-q4-of-fy20-due-to-ongoing-lockdowns

Microsoft quarterly Gaming revenue is $1.3b of $12.9b total revenue. New console likely boosts. An iPhone used to be $400. It is now well over $1000. Microsoft‚Äôs new system is a cash cow.

Sony‚Äôs gaming revenue is over 50% of total revenue so bigger impact there, but PS5 looks amazing. Buying one regardless of price. The government is printing money.My money would be on MSFT, not sure about Sony. Microsoft has a decent cloud business running, a PC division, and their video games. So if there are losses in the Xbox Series X, they still have Xbox One with game pass subscription, plus any PC revenue. 

Also, I think the government is still contracting Microsoft Azure. So \*shurg\* whether that will lead to huge gains is debatable, but it seems stable to me. So far it has been, even after the March drop.MSFT is well diversed unlike Sony , MSFT stock is not gonna get affect that muchGame console sales don‚Äôt make up anywhere near even 10% of with companies revenue. Both heavily diversified and both can wait on sales to pick up once the checks finally pop offProbably not going to affect negatively as the expectation is that gaming industry is doing better in the pandemic than before. Even if it poses a negative effect, it would only be short term, as console business runs 5-6 years in sales before a new one is released. So the potential earnings will just be saved up and spend in a few years down the road.

So all in all I am not worried.Agreed that sales are going to better because of covid/unemployment, not worse, as crazy as that sounds, especially if enhanced unemployment is extended through 2020.Not to mention their growing foothold in the development community with tools like GitHub and VSCode.They‚Äôre also doing great with MS Teams during this whole pandemic wirh so many employees working from home.Oh ok good to know! You mentioned the iPhone and it‚Äôs price increase, what would that have to do with Microsoft?(Anecdotally) Agreed. MS gaming division is for kids. Gimme that sweet O365 experience plus TikTokYou thought Microsoft and Sonys product getting more expensive would price people out. The iPhone is a product that has jumped significantly while gaining corporate revenues for Apple.  Example of how increasing price not necessarily bad for the companies.

I would argue the gaming console need to go up to pay for the computing and graphics power, not to mention storage.Gotcha. I found out that both Microsoft and Sony switched from Intel to AMD for their GPU. So AMD will probably be a good bet as well.They give you a warning about this. Robinhood won‚Äôt do anything about it, their customer support is horrid enough as is. Might be SOLThis is more or less the risk holding of till expiration.If you don‚Äôt have the capital to exercise an option robinhood will automatically sell it an hour before close.On experation day always set a limit order on rh.Here‚Äôs your advice. 

Ditch robinhood. It‚Äôs an absolute joke of a platform when it comes to trading, especially options.I‚Äôm in the minority here but I truly believe many investors confuse CRSP with CRISPR technology. CRSP is one of several companies with a patent claim to the technology and historically the license to tech like this gives a company anywhere between 1-3% of the revenue from firms using this tech. I think CRISPR has lots of potential but I‚Äôm not putting any of my money into CRSP. I‚Äôd much rather stick with well known biotech companies because I believe these are the entities that will figure out how or even if CRISPR can be monetized.You‚Äôre last paragraph is pretty right. Analysts need a number to focus on and they picked revenue because it shows how much potential their investment backers think they have. The amount of money they give Crispr is probably dependent on what data they‚Äôve gathered at the end of each trial. In 2017 they proved they could edit genes in Vito and in 2019 they started human trials(the price increase going into 2020).  So the big companies that provide the money for them to keep researching are doing what you‚Äôre last paragraph suggests just without regards to the market. Analysts just use that number to evaluate their stock. I‚Äôd imagine one way to get a good price point is by trying to calculate how much revenue they could make when they are able to completely cure one of the diseases they are working on. That will be a lot higher then where their price is now. As their progress increases there will probably be more companies willing to collaborate with large amounts of money as well. 

Edit: Spending a lot on research and development would be a good sign. It increases the resources they have to work on the problems and increases the likely hood another breakthrough will occur.

Edit 2: If I was a big company I wouldn‚Äôt just dump a lot in to make Crispr profitable. What‚Äôs the point because they‚Äôd wouldn‚Äôt be the following year since they didn‚Äôt develop a product. It‚Äôs better to invest over time with them as they produce results because if they don‚Äôt produce results I can reduce the amount of money I invest in them.As a lot of the people here say, this is pure speculation. You can‚Äôt really come up with a number to say how much they are or will be worth. Gene editing has a huge amount of uses outside of medicine, but for human health, I would say we‚Äôre at least 10 years away from it being approved and viable.

Sickle cell is not really the market. It‚Äôs just the easiest target as proof-of-principle. We can remove someone‚Äôs hematopoietic system, edit it, and give it back. You can‚Äôt do that with any other organ. That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs a lot of interest in using adenovirus to deliver gene edits to particular tissues, but adenovirus has a lot of issues.

Even if their sickle cell treatment works, it‚Äôd still be many many years to profitability.

My take is, if you believe in this space, put your money into ARKG (as I do) instead of the individual companies. Let ARK swing trade these speculative plays. Meanwhile, if you want something safer, buy Illumina, TXG, and Thermo Scientific. These guys will steadily grow with the genome revolution.I think the only reason CRSP is valued the way that it is, is based on the belief that they‚Äôre the sole CRISPR tech company. In my eyes, the tech is limitless and the future of eugenics. The only problem is government and regulations against its progress.  China can make beagles look like pit bulls and American companies can‚Äôt buy a less narrow pathway.  I would LOVE to buy into CRSP, but there‚Äôs too much holding the technology back. The moment Novartis, Eli Lily, Baxter, etc. become players in the game, I‚Äôm in. My gf‚Äôs uncle started some rare disease pharmaceutical co. And it supported just over 5,000 people in the US. He eventually got bought bought out for millions, but that buying company wasn‚Äôt on the top of the world either. In my opinion, CRSP is a minnow in a lake we‚Äôre not even 10 ft. deep in (nor know the full depth) and I wouldn‚Äôt bet on it to come out on top as the apex predator.  It pains me to say it, but I surely wouldn‚Äôt value them too greatly unless they have have some virologist in Finland sitting on the cure for the common coldI have crossposted this post to:

Companies such as this are early in the growth phase and it will take many years for them to mature and for the legal aspect to work itself out. Think of it as a long term, long shot investment that could easily 10x in the future (or go to 0).You don‚Äôt. Some companies are a lot easier to value than others, and value investors stick to those.Yeah. I don't understand how CRSP is even a stock? It doesn't seem like they do the bulk of the bench work or even hold any real novel patents. Broad, Thermo, etc all have some CRISPR patent of some sort and I'd trust bigger established firms to come up marketable products or licenses.

The only real thing you can patent in this space are delivery systems or chimeric/optimized Cas* proteins. The guide RNA sequences are arguably naturally occurring so have fun with that in court.Thanks for this response! I bought into CRSP as a company thinking I could ride some speculative wave of wild discovery over the next 5 years. But as you stated, this is a pure speculative play with the end game being potentially zero dollar valuation. Any money I put into CRSP should be money I should feel comfortable betting on black on roulette as well.

You're right about taking that money and putting it into ARKG if I truly believe in the industry. Unfortunately, I think ARKG's performance speaks for the adoption of the technology. If you look over the past 5 years, ARKG has had middling performance, going from $20 a share to $37 share before COVID hit, and actually having underperforming VOO in the first 4 years and then only recently overperforming it during COVID lockdown.

This entire performance gives me pause as it makes me feel like maybe society isn't ready for genomic biotech quite yet.Investing in CRSP after the big player have gotten involved in missing the boat a little bit isn't it? Wouldn't you expect CRSP to already have run up and established the technology before Novartis or Eli Lilly decide to get involved?Even as a growth investor, its really hard to understand a valuation of a company like CRSP. Their total available market is complicated in assessment.Thanks to you both for this information! The company's website http://www.crisprtx.com/ makes it seem like Crispr Therapeutics (the company) somehow owns CRISPR the technology. But you're right, they're not connected. Crispr Therapeutics only has some patented implementations of the technology to treat certain diseases. But as you both said, this is highly speculative with an unclear understanding of how investors even plan to get ROI on their investment as CRSP the company has no real business plan.Exactly. If you want fast money, this isn‚Äôt it. But over the long term (next 30 years) I have no doubt the growth in this sector will be outrageous. I think COVID has made people more forward thinking but in reality has actually slowed down the genome revolution. That‚Äôs why Illumina just dropped 10%. Hype far outpaced reality.


So I‚Äôm buying the dip. The gene editing is rudimentary right now, but it works, and some of the results are spectacular.  It‚Äôll just take society a while to come around.


https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-innovative-gene-therapy-treat-pediatric-patients-spinal-muscular-atrophy-rare-diseaseI don't know about Lilly and Novartis specifically but a lot of the big players are already involved in CRSPR technology.I read on another string that an entry price was $60 and that $90 was too high. Just relaying what I read.Might be related but what‚Äôs your thoughts on SDGR?Quantum computing will 10x their valuation.I think it might not fall. In this environment stocks only go up. They had a great Q2, and they‚Äôre riding the return to sports momentum on top of that and the soon to be launch of their Barstool sports betting app. I don‚Äôt see it making a big drop. Btw, DKNG bag holder here.Their Sports betting app comes out in September, that will cause another spike.  So no fall anytime soon.I think you are right.It'll go up to at least $52 per my crystal ball.I agree, even if big investment sold out, the retail traders would help keep this stock price up. Barstools release of their betting app is only going to help push it up. 9/18 $45 put play might be profitable but I‚Äôd set a stop loss right away and around %15 because it could break $50 next week tooI wonder how DKNG will react to the Barstool appI know the app will cause a pre-anticipatory run, but that‚Äôs later on - I just don‚Äôt understand how it can‚Äôt maintain a RSI of 80+ on the 180 for over a week without correcting soon.Especially since a stimulus deal or executive order is almost 100% guaranteed next week. I wouldn‚Äôt buy puts on anything unless everything fails or until a few days after it‚Äôs passed.We‚Äôll have to see who has the most market share. Analysts are bullish on DKNG leading in sports betting, but Barstool has a large fan base.The app is coming out in September, so it‚Äôs close.  I see your point though, but Portnoy will pump it in the meantime.Did you mean to say ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt buy puts?‚ÄùYes, I‚Äôm an idiot. I think autocorrect hit me.Your ETF choice is a mismatch with your risk tolerance.

A medium risk tolerance translates to VBAL or VGRO. 

VFV has you concentrated in only the SP500, a US index of large cap stocks, so you cover only 45% of the global market cap, and only cover 1 out of 4 geographical areas. 

With TEC you are concentrated in only 1 or 2 out of a possible 11 economic sectors.

You cannot predict the future.


From FelixYYZ:


Some charts to look at:

Canada outperformed the world: [https://ibb.co/pnDqKTg](https://ibb.co/pnDqKTg)

The world outperformed the US market: [https://warrenstreetwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Performance-Leadership.png](https://warrenstreetwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Performance-Leadership.png)

In short, nobody knows if the US will lead the world in market performance.If I was 19 I would just throw it all on TEC, but your plan is smarter - gives you the higher growth tech stuff but keeps the rest on an index just in case.

Just remember that you're never locked in - if you want to rebalance or change things down the road, it's always just a couple of clicks away.ARKF.If you don‚Äôt want to take time to research companies and have a low risk tolerance I would go with VGRO. I‚Äôm your age and in my TFSA I actually own mostly individual stocks and TEC. But in my RRSP I have VFV, TEC and VGRO.If your risk tolerance is medium, I'd go for 50% In the Nasdaq like ZQQ which is basically TEC with addition of even more companies for some extra diversification. Then add in 10% in either utilities, silver or gold (a bet against inflation). Finally, put the rest in  ZTL - Treasury bonds. I know they aren't exciting, but this is a modified "permanent portfolio" or "all weather portfolio" based on your risk tolerance and current market conditions that's what I would suggest.Arkw imoIMO VUN is better than VFV.**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

Further than that and it'll likely be eaten up from decay even if VIX does eventually spike back up. Buy VIXM or XVZ instead. Much more stable and better for longer term holdings.You're going to get a spike in ViX over the next 3 months for sure but that spike will probably not get it back to where it is now. Vix spikes are like crashes, they never get back to where they were prior. The Nasdaq is at 11k, not -1.5kmight spike for a bit until EOM, but may dip in sep once markets start speculating covid vaccine trial results. if you already bought, just sell off some shares once you get profit to lower your effective costs and hold till election news starts to cycle (historically vix spikes up during voting peroids). if you haven't bought yet, you can wait until sep to buy.

be careful with vix based etfs, incredibly volatile rn. tbh just watch it and you might find an entry that youre comfortable with.Uvxy is very volatile , so yes it could spike but it could go very low before that so if you buy at 22 then it goes at 18 and spikes back to 22 you will loose . Also notice that it always rolls over the figures for the next 2 months and the vix futures for November are already high so with the September roll over you will pay a higher pricejfc lol.... why not just buy it when it actually is spiking?It‚Äôs already priced in my sweet summer child. Look at vixcentral.com

See that October VIX future?I also bought UVXY today at 22.46-22.65,...I don‚Äôt know,...seems like a smart play to me, although we need DOW down -180 pts or more from here to really get it going.The bigger question is how can a person bet long volatility and manage decay. I haven‚Äôt found a good way to do this that doesn‚Äôt require a lot of mental bandwidth. Best equity based suggestions I have received are shares in VIRT and various land trusts.Hmm how I see it don‚Äôt be too greedy with the numbers buy now or wait a couple weeks are your two options because looks like it‚Äôs just gonna keep going down. In my understanding it will go up later up the road :*Dont play with UVXY unless you know what you‚Äôre doing. You don‚ÄôtI do use it as a small hedge. I expect if to continue to decay if the market keeps going up in which case hopefully my long positions go up by more than the decay. It is risky but currently we have the perfect setup for a potential 1987 event. (Sadly the -20% limit means we cannot get -30% in a day and VIX spike to new all time highs like above 150 of 1987. We will not beat the 1987 single day drop.) We just need a high inflation print or something that creates a paradigm shift, especially one that would suggests monetary and fiscal tightening is coming much faster than expected combined with people realizing at this rate a billion people might get covid before any vaccine is made available. (All of which while they may sound extravagant/obviously negative are a possibility.) say next year and you get a major crash given valuations, expectations vs. underlying macroeconomic reality. For now, the fed is dampening volatility until either the economy really improves or if underlying fundamentals do not improve they have to choose between keeping markets propped up with liquidity vs maintaining the purchasing power of the currency. The questions becomes if things/economy got worse and inflation picked up at the same time (due to supply disruptions and stimulus), would the fed choose to abandon inflation control for a little while or choose to pop the bubble? While this is a small probability event, it is not entirely impossible.then he wouldn't get points for, "making the call"Monday?Hover over the list of your stocks with the cursor and then use the scroll wheel.The FOMO lately on apple stock, especially because of the split, is insane.I bought Apple in 2013-2014 when it was in the 400s when I was just starting out in buying stocks. I thought it was a bit high then but I was newbie back then. Stock price just kept on rising and finally they did a 7:1 split a few months later when it was between 650-700. Post-split, it was somewhere around high 90s.

So look where it is right now, it‚Äôs back to almost where it was 6 years ago. If you believe in the company and you‚Äôre a longterm investor, why not buy now?Buy it and forget about it for 10 yearsdon't buy for the split.... buy it because it's a great company that you believe in... then forget about your investment - only remembering should you wish to buy some more...  


Then in 20 years take a look how it isIt can go up. It can go down. What do you think about Apple's short and long term prospects? Ask yourself why you want to buy it. It's all up to you. Good luck.$500 before August 24... you do the math.I feel you man it‚Äôs really hard to tell what will happen before the split and after. I also get the notion that a buy now is more or less a ‚Äúdiscount‚Äù for when the split comes. But I‚Äôm 100% about buying during the split. It is totally a ‚ÄúFOREVER‚Äù and ever hold and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad investment at any price tag, steadily growing and almost guaranteed quarterly dividends. Wish I woulda said that to myself a while agoHonestly, I am so excited about the split. I would have about 100 shares and then I do covered call.Set it and forget itDollar Cost AverageProbably creeps up into the split then stays calm for a while. Personally I like it now, but anyone who claims to be able to predict these things with over 65% certainty is either Ray Dalio or full of shit.

(Heavy weighting on the latter.)IMO I think it will keep rising until the split. For some reason people love a stock split eventhough there are fractional shares now. However I'd be cautious as the stock is considered overvalued and the split could be a reason there is selloff and profit taking, but if you believe in the company long-term then it doesn't really matter when you get in.Look it's quite simple.

If you bought 10 years ago, would you sell now?

No -> then buy now
Yes -> then don't buy nowI believe Apple has so much more to offer as well. I remember reading about their work on self driving cars and Apple glass (eye glasses). Also, genius to stock split to make it affordable for everyone every so often. Apple can‚Äôt be stopped.So this stock split is not gonna help anyone because the price is gonna go beyond $500-600 dollars. Anyone thinking they will get apple for $100-125 you are dreaming! The price is gonna go up during August and this 4:1 split isn‚Äôt gonna be great for those that are poorI never understood the point of forever holding. Do people have a fetish of taking maximum amount of shares to their graves with them? Is this some sort of Pharaoh fantasy?  Die with maximum accumulation of wealth?ATTACK!!!When people say ‚ÄúBuy and hold forever‚Äù I don‚Äôt understand? Your telling me you want to hold this until you die?To be fair, they're the most valuable company in the world and one of the best run in the world. Unless something crazy happens, just buy it and forget about it.Yeah. I bought 32 shares of AAPL in 2008 for about $130 a share. About $4,100 cost basis. Sold in 2014 for a house purchase. If I had not sold, would be worth just under $100,000. Kill me.Not everyone has $400 üòÇBecause tech is overvalued, and we're overdue for a correction any month now.Why not both? I believe in apple, so I bought a ton before split to guarantee a good position before the run-up when the $120 folks come buying their shares of Apple.Appreciate this. Thank youIt's Apple, it can only go up. Honestly seems like I'm too optimistic, but I mean this is Apple, c'mon now lol.That screws up the 4:1When most people say "hold forever" they don't literally mean forever, they mean until you get sick of work and can afford to stop.If the stock pays a dividend you can make a lot of money overtime by holding the shares (most famously like Warren Buffet and his KO shares).

In the case of buying AAPL today though, yeah you aren't getting rich off of dividends.Winning capitalismThe asset grows over time and in the future you can claim the current value as an asset for things such as loan and mortgages.U clearly never heard of financial independence and withdrawal rates etc..This generally means that it is a stock you are confident enough in that you can buy it and forget about it until you need it; You don't need to monitor it closely or move in and out of it with price fluctuations.:'(No lmao 

HOLD until it‚Äôs life changing money for youYeah sure, really glad I bought some in the past and of course still holding.Unless something crazy happens you say?  Well, September 2020 is coming up.But then you wouldn‚Äôt have had the money for the houseNon apple stock I owned in the last few years I bought in at 10k @ 70c. Sold 2 years ago for a just over $2, so tidy profit. Come todays market the stock I had sold is now in $20's. If only we could see the futureCan I ask how would I be 100k? 
32 x $450= $14400 genuinely curiousLol true. I saved up a bit just to buy Apple stocks üòÇThen buy puts, but you won‚Äôt because you know deep down it might not happenTime in the market beats timing the market?...$125 a share thenWhat happens in September 2020?They‚Äôll be up again after a pandemic or election, I was really thinking Of something like a different CEO who is out of touch, they fail to adapt to what the future holds, China bans Apple, etc.Stock splits.There was a 7:1 split in 2014 so his shares would‚Äôve been 224. So that‚Äôs 224 x $450 = ~$100kThat‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing and if that‚Äôs tumulus check comes in time then it‚Äôs going to appleHe can believe its going to go down and still not have a desire to get into options. Just like how you can be long on apple and not buy callsThats why we all bought the dip on Pets.comOhh totally forgot bout that . Thanks have a good oneHe can also just pipe down**I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**

Some brokers will others will give you a margin call until you explicitly go in and assign your option to cover the shares you are now short.It depends on your broker but generally if you don't have the funds, they will take action and exercise your long call to buy-to-cover the shares you are now short. 

Notice you'd be selling stock short at the higher strike and buying to cover at the lower strike, so you'd be at max profit for your original spread.

If you can arrange it with your broker it would make even more sense if you SELL your call and then, along with the proceeds from the short sale (because of assignment) you buy-to-cover your short position. This way you get to keep the extrinsic value on your long call and you'd actually make a bit more (in the amount of the remaining extrinsic on your long) than the original max profit on your spread. You'd have to work with fidelity on that though.A 50% inclusion rate applies to capital gains and is taxed at your marginal rate. Make $1000 gain? $500 is included and added to you income tax and taxed according to your bracket. Dividends and distributions have their own taxation rules. Any fees from margin borrowing, etc, are deductions.


> I could just google this but I thought it be better to have other people's opinions on this.

You're right. This is all ridiculously easy to Google. Taxes aren't a matter of "opinion"... you aren't going to find different answers by asking Reddit.The TaxTips website is good for questions like this.  

At each income level, it lets you see what you'd pay on capital gains, Canadian dividends, and 'other income' like interest.  [This is the Ontario page,](https://www.taxtips.ca/taxrates/on.htm) but they have data for all the provinces.

At 23, you're probably correct to go for a regular taxable account, and not an RRSP.  Save that RRSP room for later, when you're pulling down a bigger income.Depends on you income. Like mentioned, it's a 50% inclusion rate, and cap gains are taxed at your marginal rate. 

So if you're a relatively high earner making $100K+ a year and have a $1000 capital gain in a stock and sell, you'll pay about $180 out of your $1000 gain in capital gain taxes. That assumes 36% marginal tax rate, note many provinces are higher than that.> other people‚Äôs opinions

The *only* opinion is that you pay your marginal tax rate on 50% of the capital gain. This is like asking for opinions on the value of œÄ (like Indiana once tried to do).Hopefully you will be working and can start to max out RRSPthank you!!Quebec is 47% marginal at that level...or 43% in Ontario..haha hopefully :)Not in Alberta though üòä**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*So this year has had some unusual events for me. I'm scheduled to make roughly 700k this year with roughly 400k to 450k ending up free after taxes and yearly income that I use. I make around 140k in my steady job and bring in random amounts of cash, anywhere from 10k to 60k in apps I've made and work stock profits. I have a house which is practically paid off with a small monthly mortgage, like 3k in debt, and 2 cars with interest below 0.9%. I'm 38 years old  married with a few kids.

So with this new found fortune, I want this money to grow and hopefully earn more than the 1.2 percent interest I get in a savings account. What would you guys recommend? I plan on keeping the amount owed to uncle sam in a savings account. Then my profits, maybe have another 200k in another savings account and the rest in the stock market on blue chip stocks or safe etfs which I would out stop losses on everything. Hopefully it grows from there, but honestly I need some advice, what would you guys do in my situation? I also thought about putting some money into properties and renting them out, but waiting on the market to crash to motivate me to make that step, I'm in l.a. and prices are crazy right now.I'm 19 and Canadian. I'm considering opening up a Wealthsimple trade account, and I would like to know if it's generally safe to give them my SIN number. 

If this was any other info, I wouldn't be *as* concerned. But given that it's my SIN, I don't want to take an unneeded risk if I don't have too. 

I'm comforted by the fact that it's a fairly popular app, but still. Any general advice, or firsthand experience would be appreciated.Do investors typically use trailing stop losses on all their trades. If a 10% stop is in place and the market drops, wouldn‚Äôt that protect most investors from large losses. Besides tax implications on the sale, what are the downsides of using trailing stop losses or just a stop loss at your purchase price?How concerned should you be if a company has filed for shelf registration, is there a high risk of share dilution, can you even judge this or is it a pure roll of the dice?Relatively new to investing in non-registered investment account.

I have been investing in a non-registered investment account. I have been tracking all my transactions on paper (date bought, cost of investment, units bought, reinvested dividend etc), as well as putting this on excel.

So when I see online the book value of my investments, they are all equal to the ACB that I have calculated.

For example, for one investment I calculated $2300 as the ACB (including dividend reinvested). When I look at the book value online, it has the same amount.

I plan to retire in about 15-20 years. I will just keep contributing (not sell parts of my investments along the way).

Do I still need to keep track of ACB because when I do sell when I retire, it will equal the book value of my investment?Can you make gains on your gains?

I was talking to somebody about exponential stock growth and he told me it's impossible unless you sell your gains in stock A and buy back into stock A immediately.

  


These are his exact words:

  


‚ÄúIf you invest $1000 and it gains 10%, you now have $1100. In year two if your investment increases another 10% you only get another $100‚Äù

  


Which means that any further increase in the next years are only gained on your original $1,000. You cannot make gains on your gains unless you sell your gains and reinvest them back into the same stock.

  


I then asked what if you sell your gain, and the stock shoots up thereby increasing your average buy price. He said to sell and buy back in immediately.

  


Does this make sense to anybody here?

  


NOTE: he was not talking about reinvesting dividends. Just pure share price growth.When will Snowflake and Instacart go public?I've got a fairly high risk tolerance. I'm trying to figure out my ETF distribution myself but (obviously) I'm getting tons of competing information on what my allocation should be. I do want to be somewhat aggressive but I don't want to overlap my risk too much. I already sink a ton into SWPPX but was thinking I should probably diversify a little bit. The info on Schwab is thorough but a little overwhelming in its volume - domestic equity? International equity? Small growth? Etc. Where can I find some information on what exactly it means to spread amongst these categories?This is my first year of investing/trading. I saw a thread that briefly diverted to a discussion on taxes and it raised some questions. Does anyone have experience they care to share?

&#x200B;

I know that I am taxed on "Realized Gains". I saw someone mention that if you have a loss, you can use that as a write-off up to $3,000. What I would like to clarify specifically- I currently have realized gains of \~$30K. **HOWEVER**, I am bagholding what would be roughly \~$20K in losses. So at the end of the year, assuming that there is no real change, I plan to sell and realize that loss. So would my realized gain (and thus taxable income) be the net +$10K? The way the comment was written it seemed as though you aren't able to realize the loss, which would not make any sense. Just wanting to do my DD and be prepared for the tax man in a few months.Hi! First time posting here - hoping you guys can help me out.

I‚Äôm 27 years old and I‚Äôm a PhD student. I make about 1400 a month, spending 850 for all living expenses (rent, groceries, utilities) leaving me with around 550 a month for everything else. I do end up spending most of this 550 (drinks with friends, maintaining my bike, shopping etc), or use what I save monthly (~100) for a yearly holiday and going home to see my family for Christmas. I have a few thousand saved from when I was working previously, and I have been trying to get into investing. When I finish my PhD, I should hopefully see an increase in salary and will be able to invest more. 

I currently have 1000 invested via an ISA with 500 in HSBC FTSE 250 and 500 in Legal&General UK index (both accumulation).

I have an additional ~3000 GBP that I would like to invest but I‚Äôm just kind of at a loss of what to do.

I don‚Äôt mind taking some risk (I guess medium risk? Maybe some high risk?) and I am interested in global markets and emerging markets. Also sustainable funds would be great. I am not investing for any particular reason mostly I‚Äôm just looking to grow my money (and I‚Äôm happy not to touch these investments at all, eg a 20-30 year time frame). 

I‚Äôve been looking at fidelity and vanguard tracker funds, as well as the S&P 500. from what I understand it‚Äôs best to have one fund aimed at developed global markets and one at emerging global markets, only I‚Äôm not sure which ones are right for me.

Does anybody have suggestions for the best way to invest my 3000 GBP?

Thanks for reading all this!can bank stocks go back to its previous level in 12 months period?Young investor here with massive timeline and incredible risk tolerance. Just watched a few cathie woods videos and I‚Äôm completely bought into her style of thinking regarding undervalued innovation in markets. Am I foolish to be thinking about investing 2k in each of the ARK etfs or is this a viable strategy?Hi all.

I have a quick question for you.

I bought 45 shares of SQNX about two years ago.  A few months ago, the price nearly doubled so I sold 30 of the shares at the same price as the stock price was.

Now, the stock has gone up again to $69 and I was just looking to see how much I would make if I sold the remaining 15 shares.  But when I attempt to sell, it says the sell price is $35.71.

Why is the sell price so much lower and the buy price so much higher than the current stock price?I'm breaking even with AMZ, DIS, BA, MSFT, V, AAPL.

Shall I sell or start over with QQQ?

Or should I buy NVDA, GOOGL to complement my existing portfolio? 

If I didn't have BA in my portfolio I would already be in the green, but I will stick with individual stocks over an ETF *if* there's a higher likelihood for profit. I'm comfortable taking the risk that those companies will not go under in the near future.Hello! I am looking to invest into one company, but I have no account or any prior experience.

I live in Finland so I can't use robinhood.Shoud I Put My individual Stocks in my Roth IRA or Taxable account?

Currently, I have VTSAX, with it being 100% of my portfolio. 

I am highly interested in investing in specific blue chip stocks I have done DD for. Would it be best to buy these stocks as part of my Roth IRA where any gains are locked into the Roth or for a normal account so I may withdraw gains anytime after a year when needed?Travel industry

New here, new to investing, and very excited to get started! 19 year old student looking to make smart, yet high risk investments. 

Obviously the travel industry is really hurting due to covid. I feel that if you pick a survivor, the company can bounce back to what it once was, and even surpass that. 

Specifically speaking, I am interested in $SPR, which is SpirtAeroSystems. Long story short, they lead in terms of providing parts for planes, etc. 

Their share price is still down at $20.90 and has been here since covid has started. It was $90 pre-covid. I see this as a great long-term investment. 

With all this being said, I don‚Äôt know much about the company, lol. 

Appreciate any feedback and thoughts.Should I hold BEPC in my brokerage account or in my Roth IRA, taxwise? Same question for BEP. I had been avoiding BEP due to the K-1 but recently opened a brokerage account and I'm not sure how to proceed post-BEP split.I have about 75k in an online savings account and I am trying to come up with a low-risk way to earn on it. Pretty new to ingesting and wary of picking winners as I‚Äôve seen folks suffer as a result. But I also feel like an idiot keeping it in cash. Any advice on what you would do in my position? I know folks talk a lot about equities, but are there other asset classes I should be researching? Appreciate any and all thoughts. 

Background: late 20s
Salary: 150k
Goals: earn modest return without much risk on vast majority of account. Maybe set aside some play money.Has anyone here obtained a net worth of over $1 million by investing?Are there any ETFs or Mutual Funds centered around Hollywood/the entertainment industry?So I have 3.5k invested at the moment. Not a lot, I know. But it would be life changing to me if this increased to even just 4k by the end of this year. That said, I'm not sure if I should sell everything I have right now given the volatility of the market, or if I should continue to hold until at least elections. Currently most of my stocks are in fractional shares of microsoft, apple, google, tesla, amazon, netflix, nvidia, amd, and paypal, as well as some more riskier buys like docusign, wix, square, and shopify (before rocketing).My company just went public and team members will be getting some restricted stock (I think that is what they called it) - but I went ahead and purchased like 4 shares via Robinhood. I am a complete newborn when it comes to stocks. Is robinhood a good app to use? Are there better ones? I do not foresee taking a major plunge until I feel more comfortable but spending like $100 every two weeks to buy a few stocks here and there I definitely could foresee me doing.  Most of my concern is on leveraging some of the early on applications to learn from, so is robinhood a solid app to start with? Any other suggestions?I have no advice, being a younger student, but can you offer some? How do you invest that well?Feels weird giving advice to someone who makes way more money than me, but if I were you I'd avoid becoming a landlord right now.  

Lots of people aren't paying rent right now, and causing a lot of headaches for the property owners on their way out the door.It's safe as can be. Every company has the potential to have their data breached however, or have a rogue employee commit fraud. Besides those rare cases they're safe and wealth simple trade is a great starting point for learning.This assumes it can be filled, just remember a stock  fall 9%, then gap down another 10%+ after hours, free fall another 10% on market open so you could potentially still lose 30%+

Also the possibility of a flash crash where it goes down 11% then quickly recovers>Besides tax implications on the sale, what are the downsides of using trailing stop losses or just a stop loss at your purchase price?

That the stock goes down 10%, your position gets closed, then the stock recovers, goes up, and never comes back downI mean if you want too keep track of it you can but your brokerage should do this as well. It should keep track of each lot you buy , and show an cost basis of all your buys.Yes, take a company that grows 10% per year or even grows fcf 10% per year their stock price should follow (with a bunch of other factors) but in simple terms lets say a company earns the following

&#x200B;

Year 1 they make 100 million 

Year 2 they grow 10% and make 110 million

year 3 they grow 10% and make 121 Million

Where did that extra 1 million come from in year 3, compound growth; this will also be reflected in the stock priceScenario 1: Buy and Hold

1. Buy 100 shares of a stock for $1 = $100
2. Stock gains 10% in 1 year ($0.10)
3. Your shares are now worth $110
4. Gains another 10% in year 2 ($0.11)
5. Your shares are now worth $121

Scenario 2: Sell then Rebuy

1. Buy 100 shares of a stock for $1 = $100
2. Stock gains 10% in 1 year ($0.10)
3. Your shares are now worth $110
4. Sell 100 shares at $1.1 = $110
5. Buy 100 shares at $1.1 with your $110
6. Stock gains another 10% ($0.11)
7. Your shares are now worth $121

This ignores taxes and transaction costs, and presumes that you can rebuy in at the exact same price. If you factor those in you'll probably end up with a loss in scenario 2.

Whoever told you that is an idiot and you probably shouldn't listen to his advice.lol what bullshit[https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund\_portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio)

So the classic 3 fund portfolio recommends a total market fund, if you do not want to swap SWPPX for a total market I might look into

mid cap

bonds.

Schwab has both MF and ETFs index funds for these.Your investment realized gains/losses will always net out, the 3k is the amount of investing losses you can write off against other income like w2 wages.

So if you have 100k realized gains, and 95k realized losses your tax liability for the year is on the 5k of gains.

Now lets say you have 100k of realized losses and 80k of realized gains; and you also make 100k w2 salary

well your realizes losses would be 20k, however you can take 3k and write that off from other income (like your w-2 wages) so you could adjust your income down to 97k based on the write off

your 17k of losses would carry forward next year, and lets say you had a 20k realized gain next year, well it would net and you would have 3k gain and no more lossesYes it is possible.

Will they ? I have no clue. I would predict no as there isn't much spread on interest rates they can profit from and I do not see interest rates rising in the next year; but like everything I could be 100% wrongI personally wouldn't do it until I had at least $10,000 in the boring, broad market index funds/ETF's like VTI.  But you do you.I‚Äôm not going to offer any advice as I still have a lot to learn but I‚Äôm just curious how long you‚Äôve held these stocks?  I own 3 of the stocks you‚Äôve listed and they are doing well for me specifically Apple.For the most part yes you need a brokerage account to buy stock. Technically some companies have direct stock purchase programs (in the USA anyway) but they will act at the brokerage .

Off topic after cororna is over I really hope to visit finlandIts really up to you; personally in my retirement accounts I am in 100% index funds and I prioritize maxing out my tax advantaged accounts first.

After that if I have extra money I will throw it in a taxable brokerage for individual stock purchases . Personally I want my retirement fund to be safe in broad based index funds and bonds.

My taxable account is just extra gambling money I take greater risks on and buy individual stocks>down at $20.90 and has been here since covid has started. It was $90 pre-covid. I see this as a great long-term investment. 
>
>With all this being said, I don‚Äôt know much about the company, lol.

Just because a stock was at 90 and is now at 23 doesn't make it a good investment. You are falling for what is called anchoring bias.

A stocks past price is largely irrelevant.Define what low risk means to you? Are you willing to potentially lose 10-15% or do you want it to be 100% safe?Tons of people, there are lots of 401k millionaire'sMy suggestion, sell anything that you are positive on, buy anything you can for QQQ. Turn on DRIP and call it a day. 5 star morningstar rating, some of the highest 1yr, 3yr, 5yr inception date returns for any ETF. One of the most stable. Contains most of what you already bought. Look it up, you'll be a lot happier than you are now. This is a true set/forget style ETF.I'm not good at investing, but here is how I have made the most money in the long run:

1. Hustle, hustle, hustle... It can be making apps, buying and selling products, etc.... But always try to make money. You won't necessarily become rich doing this, but it will change your mentality so when the opportunity comes up for you to make a bunch of money then you'll see it and take advantage while others won't realize that opportunity exists.
2. Work at a company that offers good benefits, stock options and employee stock purchase programs are very powerful if you stick with the right company for the right amount of time. The hustle mentality will help there also.
3. Always try to help where you can, find joy in problem solving because that's really what your doing in most situations, it will also present more opportunities.Thanks, your right that's why I'm avoiding taking that jump right now, but hopefully in the future if everything goes back to normal at some pointYes, but if your set up right and have alerts for Movement and are watching it rise again, why can‚Äôt you buy again and set another stop loss. It‚Äôs an added layer of protection. If it was set at 1% or something that‚Äôs a little to much, unless your day trading consistently and know what to do. 10% is a big drop for a reliable stock. If let‚Äôs say Microsoft drops 10% in a day then there is probably something pretty serious going on. So having that stop loss would protect your initial investmentWhat is fcf?

Anyway he said you are 100% wrong. You need to sell your profits and reinvest them back into the same stock to get compound growth.

  


Btw I agree with you.Well actually in scenario 2 point 4: he said you should sell only the profit. Not all 100 shares. So sell $0.10 worth of shares, then buy the same stock with that $0.10. Preferably immediately he said in case the stock price fluctuates.

If you do this forever then you'll get compound growth Warren buffet style.Can you tell me how I can explain to him that he's wrong?I actually like swppx but I‚Äôm looking to balance it with something else that diversifies me a little further and doesn‚Äôt have a concern about overlap. Thanks for sending that by!That is exactly what I was looking to understand, I really appreciate your help!Agreed. They may go up when they start laying people off.Not long at all. I've held AAPL and AMZN for around a week, the rest for 2 months. I only broke even when I added those and BA recouped $20 but it's still -20% overall because I bought it at a bad time. I have a lot to learn too, my friend.Good point. I feel as though it can still make a strong return as long as travel comes back, not necessarily $90 but greater than what it is now.Thank you for your advice.So what happens if you buy in again, it goes down again, and your position closes again so you now have two realized losses resulting in permanent loss of capital? 

It seems like a better defense would be to buy stocks in good companies that you believe in so that a drop in price won't be a problem, or would even be an opportunity to buy more.I‚Äôm trying to think how it would have worked this March. Say you had stop losses in place, market plummets 30%, all your stock gets sold. 

Do you have orders in place to buy at the original price before the drop?  Or you‚Äôd watch it and decide when to get back in ? You‚Äôd be sitting on cash at that point.>sell those profits and reinvest them back into the same company to get compound growth.

LOL sorry that doesn't make sense, what point would that do except cause taxes.

You invest 10k into stock

1 year goes buy you have 11k invested due to capital appreciation of the stock  now you can either

1.sell and re-buy in the end you have 11k invested(assuming you can sell and re-buy at the same price)

2. do nothing and have 11k invested

11k=11k math checks out>Anyway he said you are 100% wrong. You need to sell your profits and reinvest them back into the same stock to get compound growth.

That makes absolutely no sense.Free cash flowAre you serious? This is like the most fundamental concept of investing.>Well actually in scenario 2 point 4: he said you should sell only the profit. Not all 100 shares. So sell $0.10 worth of shares, then buy the same stock with that $0.10. Preferably immediately he said in case the stock price fluctuates.

1. Buy 100 shares of a stock for $1 = $100
2. Stock gains 10% in 1 year ($0.10)
3. Your shares are now worth $110
4. Sell $10 worth of shares (let's presume that you can sell shares on a fractional basis to get exactly $10)
5. You now have $10 in cash and $100 in shares
6. Use the $10 to buy shares at $1.1
7. You now have $110 in shares
8. It goes up 10%
9. Your shares are now worth $121

It's the same thing. Whoever is telling you this is a nincompoop.

>If you do this forever then you'll get compound growth Warren buffet style.

I've read several articles and books discussing Warren Buffett's investment style and not a single one has ever described this "technique." Because it's a losing one if you factor in taxes, transaction costs, and the uncertainty of price fluctuations for zero benefit.Well the midcap/smallcap/foreign funds should have virtually no overlapA week is nothing.  No point in measuring your performance on less than a year timescale.We all don‚Äôt know when air travel will be up. Even if a vaccine forms, getting it around takes awhile. There is also the issue of vaccine compliance. 

Unless you intend to hold VERY long term... might be better looking elsewhereStop loss activated. You don‚Äôt buy back in until you see a rise in the market. Your stocks turn to cash until you see the market start to turn for the better. It seems like a good strategy to me.>Stop loss activated. You don‚Äôt buy back in until you see a rise in the market. 

How do you know if it's going to be a sustainable rise in the market or if it's just a temporary bounce and it goes back down? Then your stop loss will be triggered again and you now have two realized losses and permanent loss of capital.Seeing as the session on record date ended only 37 minutes ago now (hadn't even closed when op posted), I'd give it time.are you yourself invested in GH ?This is awesome, thanks for sharing.

In 2017 they were playing to whole bitcoin run-up, now it‚Äôs a stay at home angle I think?  They have a small market cap so it‚Äôs manipulated easier,  Was thinking of short at $50. Glad I didn‚Äôt.I think the current rally will continue for a while longer, because imo it's driven by how undervalued the company is, wrt how much revenue they make and how lofty the valuations have gotten for their peers. Here's one data point that stands out to me: they made 750 million last quarter and made a profit, and their CEO expects to attain "sustainable profitability" this year, but at $103 their market cap is ~4B or <1.5X 2020 revenue. If that isn't undervalued (for a company with covid tailwind), I dunno what is.Dunno, I bought a little over a year ago as a long-term block chain play. Watched it crater and now I've sold most of it on this run. I think it's mostly just getting caught up in the COVID bubble.I bout at $22...



And sold at $34

It's insane but I'm thinking of getting back in at $100.cool lines, bro[deleted]Take a look at an intermediate term bond fund for a portion of your portfolio so that you can utilize it for rebalancing in down markets. SPAB or BND. Sell from bonds when their up, buy stocks when their down and vice versa.iShares global clean energy has been good to me but like they always say do your own researchNot yet in my opinion, wait until September and diversify also in companies outside the US to manage currency risk. My opinion as a non-pro but seasoned investor.VOO, VTI, VUG, VGT vanguard is awesomeQQQ, SPY, DIA are all good if you like indices.Just copy warren buffet or other investors who have the time and knowledge to do the research. But some Berkshire stock, some electronic company stock like apple or Microsoft (whatever you like to use), invest in a S and P 500 ETF and so on. Just pick business you know will be here and grow in 5-10 yearsSpread between FTEC (tech ETF with lowest fees), VDC (consumer staples with big names and very stable), VIOV (small caps), FNCL (financials) and FHLC (healthcare.

I have been holding some since Feb and have seen good steady gains. VDC is always stable even all else fails.

I go between Vanguard and Fidelity for the low fees, generally less than 0.1 %.The fees are a little high at .49 percent but hyg is an ishares bond fund that pays out a dividend. I don't remember whether it's monthly or quarterly and it can be somewhat volatile.  But current yield is close to 5 percent currently.I have some VOO to cover S&p but last year or 2 I‚Äôve decided to just use split it between growth and dividend growth, combined they get you basically the S&P.

SCHG large cap growth

XLK, QQQ tech

5% dkngOne ETF that I personally hold that doesn't get a lot of attention is VONG (Vanguard Russell 1000 Growth). Better returns than VOO/SPY since it's a growth ETF, better returns than other growth ETFs like VOOG or VUG and a larger number of holdings than those other growth ETFs. You end up getting a little better diversity out of it and a little more mid cap exposure vs similarly structured funds.

I also like IGM (iShares Expanded Tech Sector). QQQ has all the FAANG companies, but doesn't have any Visa or Mastercard exposure. VGT has Visa and Mastercard, but no Amazon, Facebook or Google (since they're not officially classified as tech companies - consumer discretionary and communication services). So IGM being the "expanded tech sector" has all of the above. Expense ratio is a little high but it's the only pure tech play I could find that held what I was looking for.QQQ is good.  Check out Vangaurd ETF's.  VTI, BSVLove arkk. Cathie Wood is a genius and I love her.Yes, I've been looking into the ARK Innovation. Thank you!A friend of mine mentioned something like that, but I didn't get it. I will look into this, thanks very much!I will check it out, thank you!I looked at this but it has a low dividend.  Are you holding it as a growth stock?This is my white whale, I keep looking for a good entry point, not buying, and then cursing myself for having lost out on the month's winnings.Why September specifically? Do you recommend any certain non-US companies?I do love Vanguard.I look into DIA, thanks!This is awesome! I will check out those ETF's, thank you!!!I agree, the fees are high.Rebalancing when your portfolio drifts away from your target allocation (ie; 90% stocks, 10% bonds) is the closest you can possibly get to effective market timing.Yeah I'm already up 6% in a few weeks. My reasoning is that green energy will be a big part of the economy in the future. And so intent to hold this long into the futureSet up regular small buy ins then if it dips throw a larger amount at it ?The correlation between the economy and the stock market is broken, esp in the US but not only. This implies that there is a correction underway, not for generic doom and gloom reasons but for what I describe above specifically. There are 2 reasons this happened, because of the stimuli and because the drastic slowdown of the economy has left people with very few choices on where to invest their money and the stock market is always available, open and pumped by stimuli. This situation has to correct soon, in the meantime the next stimulus might bring the markets in new highs temporarily but this will make the issue even bigger. I suggest to think about it again in September because we will have a better view how the actual economy is recovering and also the initial enthusiasm of this next stimulus will have passed. 

Why diversify away from USD, because the money printing is essentially dilution of the USD holders.

Best of luckHow do I learn about this re-balancing? Do you recommend any site, video, etc? I hear a lot about rebalancing between stocks and bonds, but I don't know what it all means. Thanks!I bought some xle for dividend but was looking for clean energy too.  I may buy some icln around the next dip.  I‚Äôm thinking around the electionThanks for the clarification.I think the option  data on TOS says what percentage of the options trades are at BID or ASK so you could deduce from thereImagine this...

You invest all your money and the market hits a correction, your tuition is due, now you have to take the money at a loss to pay for school.

A week later, the stocks goes up again.

Thats how irrational the market can be.


Do not invest if you need the money short term, it would be better if you just open a savings account with a bank that has a promotion on a HISA.Are you trolling? 
First you say you want to invest in something that‚Äôs little to no risk. Then you say you‚Äôre eager to make your money grow in the short term. 

I‚Äôll be nice and answer your questions anyway.

1. Doesn‚Äôt really matter because you shouldn‚Äôt be trading stocks given your situation.

2. You don‚Äôt NEED to use a TFSA account but you will avoid tax on your gains (interest or other). EQ doesn‚Äôt offer TFSA so you will need to transfer to TD or another institution that does.

3. Put it all in a high interest saving account

4. Look at 3.Don't invest if you need money short term. Then when you don't, dump every single penny earned into stocks etfs mutual funds. Read ccp for your RRSP, for the TFSA straight equities. Your young you don't need to be careful.> I‚Äôm going to be needing money in the short term so I was wondering if anyone could guide me on which investment option would be best fit for me. I would like to invest in something that‚Äôs little to no risk if possible. 

Put it all in EQ high savings. IMO, don't invest what you can't afford to lose. If you're okay with losing a bit then go for blue chip stocks and/or Vanguard asset allocation ETFs.investment in education and skills is the best thing you can do when young, even traveling is a good investment when young, learning other cultures will help you learn markets one dayThis sub is relatively inconsistent with their advice. Usually they‚Äôll tell you to make sure you pay off all outstanding debt you have, max out your contribution room to your TFSA, build an emergency fund of 3-6 months worth of your expenses and then you can invest.

IMO, since you have no debt make sure you set aside whatever money is needed to pay a years worth of tuition coupled with 3-6 months of your expenses for a rainy day.

Any leftover disposable cash can go into your TFSA and select one of the five major banks for relatively ‚Äúsafe‚Äù, dividend growth. With COVID, banks are still ways to go to their ATH - keep in mind that whenever we do get a second wave that would most likely drop prices again + possibility of corrections from the current recovery of the ‚Äúfirst wave‚Äù of COVID. If you can stomach seeing red for a year or two then invest. If not, take the advice listed above and put it all in a HISA. 

IMO, you‚Äôre young and nursing lands you a great paying job quickly out of school. I think you can afford to take some risks and the experience you gain from investing in the market now will put you ahead of your peers - even if you end up at a lost. 

In the long term, investing 3-5 years earlier can yield over hundreds of thousands extra gained thanks to compounding returns. I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs a bad idea to start early given your financial position.Why shouldn't he invest a small amount? He can easily to afford to throw a few thousand into some ETFs.My bad. I guess that sounds stupid on my part.Thanks for the feedback! Do you have any suggestions on what I should invest in?How do you know? OP never talks about having a job and nursing school probably costs all their savings.Oh sorry I didn‚Äôt mention in original post. I work two jobs which makes me around 6-7k per year.No. You choose when to sell or hold until expiration.Thanks!With schwab you can choose your tax strategy. You can do first in first out, highest price first, specific lots, lowest price first, last in first out. Depends on if you have short term gains to offset or if you have some lots that are long term and some that are short. It's all about the tax implications. With some funds there's also short term redemption fees to consider. I assume all brokerages allow you to choose your strategy, but I don't know that for sure.that's an interesting point I haven't thought of, I'm guessing/hoping that other brokers  have it by default First in/first out.I‚Äôm confused by this whole conversation. If I buy 50 shares of stock Y and then gradually buy another 50 shares, I now have 100 shares that are all the same value. What difference does it make which individual shares were purchased when?I didn't know this! I have schwab as well. I'll have to take a look and see where I can find thisIt'd only matter when you sell for tax purposes. If you sold the first 50 a year later, it'd incur long term capital gains tax. If you sold the latter 50 after a few months, it'd be short term.It helps to think of stocks as physical stuff... As far as the tax department is concerned every time you make a buy order that is one ‚Äútax lot‚Äù. Bought 15 shares for $20 each? Tie a bow around it and put it on the shelf. From that moment that ‚Äúlot‚Äù is a tax entity that needs to have its value input at the time when you sell it to establish how much exactly you made in capital gains, whether it was a short term or long term gain, and thus how much they will tax you.

You might buy several ‚Äúlots‚Äù over time, all sitting on the shelf together with a blended cost. So when you decide you want to sell some at $25 per share, you get to choose: are you selling from the lot you bought two years ago for $20 at a profit of $5 per share, or are you selling from the lot you bought last year at $30/share for a $5 loss per share? 

That determines how much profit you are going to get taxed.

Hope that helps?Trade>place sell>cost basis method will always show a blue hyperlink under quantity of shares.You got it. Generally it is always better to close the option position than to let it expire. The point about extrinsic value is the most salient. There is no point in letting all of the extrinsic value vaporize in such a situation. That‚Äôs just time and IV value that vanishes. At expiry that will all be gone. The fees can be relevant if they are a consequential amount. So you can buy back the short options at 0.01 and sell the long ones at 0.01 by placing your order and then forgetting it obviously. That will close you out close to zero enough if you really need that and will effectively prevent expiration and option exercise/assignment. Options trading is about risk trading as well though and there is value in getting out of risk. Close to expiry gamma values can skyrocket and if your profits get threatened by strong price action near expiry then don‚Äôt let it go to expiry. A lot of professional option traders close at 50% for this reason - volatility in your option position can get very high close to expiry esp. if price is near your strikes! At that point the risk won‚Äôt be worth the 20 to 10% more that you can squeeze out of your position since a surge in buyers or sellers could take away all your profit and have you speeding toward your max loss in the blink of an eye. Sucks to have had a 75% winner turn into a 100% max loss in the options markets. So the last benefit of not letting the debit call spread expire is that you can avoid taking on high risk at some point potentially. But yes, in terms of simple costs the assignment fees and stock selling fees would just cost you more than closing the option position in a lot of cases I think. Losing all extrinsic value though is just unnecessary when you can close the position to reclaim some of that extrinsic value and to get out of risk.Thanks /u/EverywhereFine. This makes complete sense to me now why it is much better to simply close out the spread before expiry. Speaking of closing out the spread at 50%,  /u/redtexture linked me to this yesterday: https://optionalpha.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/When-To-Exit-Guide.pdf and now it makes even more sense in light of your post why exits are at 50%. I had trouble with the math on this previously but I believe I am understanding now when to make the exit too...the 50% profit is easy to calculate on a vertical call spread......Spread of Strikes - Net Debit = Max Profit / 2. In the example...95-85 = 10-2.3 =  7.7 * 50% = 3.85. Therefore, it is likely I'm closing in on 50% profit, when the stock starts trading closer to $88.85.Great! But just to make sure you are taking everything into account, it is not just the price of the underlying that determines option prices at all. In fact, the other factors can be even more relevant. All the factors that affect an option price were put in the infamous Black-Scholes model of option price if you‚Äôve heard of it. So the one you are focused on is delta. An options delta is how much its price will change for every $1 that the underlying moves. Delta changes however and it changes at a rate of gamma which is the other directional component and which becomes esp. crucial near expiry. Vega is the amount an option price changes for every 1% change in IV and theta is how much the price changes per day allegedly. So in your example as to when your spread will be at 50% profitability, that point will be when delta, Vega, theta and gamma make it so. In other words, when the price of the underlying, the implied volatility or expected move of the underlying, the time left until the contract expires and the distance between the price and your strikes determine that your option will be up 50% in value then it will be. Take note of this as you will be surprised if you think the price of your option will only be a function of the price of the underlying friend! ... funny username lol.

They pander to the shopping as a hobby crowd and constantly refresh the items they sell. Their business model has yet to be replicated in e commerce and will be difficult to replace due to the benefit of seeing items in person, especially home furnishings. They also benefit from less required storage due to purchasing and changing out items constantly which keeps costs lower than their competition.

Seems I'm not the only one.What cause its red?It's usually a spread issue. If the bid ask is far apart, it'll seem this wayI bought a 15 call worth something like .76 and then next minute it shoots up to 1.09. I was expecting it readjust itself but the market's closed now and I don't understand the metrics in thisLudicrous someone is bidding an insane amount like that only in 15My guess is the ask is way off. If nobody is really selling the option the ask price could be 2x a reasonable market value from some market maker.

If you are willing to hold the option you can actually do okay flipping them as long as there is a little bit of daily volume (5-10 trades a day) because nobody or algos are flipping the product with a spread that wide.

For example put in a bid .05 higher than anyone else up to a little less than a reasonable market rate, if you pick one up put in a ask .10 higher than you paid on the bid. You essentially bring liquidity to the option and pocket 5-10$ on every trade someone else makes. You just have the risk or holding it until you offload it however.

Bid .60, if someone sells put it back on the market at .70 Ask. Since it seems like you the risk of holding that option I would do that all day.So you bought a stock that had their IPO yesterday with student loan money and started panicking when it when down a couple hours later? Never invest with money you cannot afford to lose.

You need to do significantly more research before investing and never do it with money you can't afford to lose, not to mention following /r/wallstreetbets for financial advice.

Here are your options:

1) Sell at a loss and learn a valuable lesson.

2) Hold and hope it goes above your cost basis before your university starts.

Which of those options are you going to choose?Take out another loan and buy some more!You are gambling, my friend, not investing. And I think you have a gambling problem if you're using borrowed money you need soon.Well that was dumb on at least two levels. Next time figure out what you're doing first. Do you even know what you bought a stake in?Just leave it alone for a yearThat‚Äôs weird I saw it on WSB yesterday and sold it when I was up 19%. Best bet is to just keep buying more until it turns positiveYoul be fine.. it‚Äôs gonna keep going upThe largest mortgage lender in the US isn't a pump-and-dump.  It will probably be volatile for a bit while it gets established on the market, but it's a good company. Just hold it.

And don't put student loans in stocks, but you've figured that out already!Dude, try to learn from this. RKT literally opened for trading yesterday, you seemingly did no research other than read a joke sub, you needed the money and you put all of your money into one asset.

Take it as something to never do again and move onWait till MondayThis has to be troll throwaway, right?You should be alright. I think it‚Äôs a good company.Thats why you need to be careful with IPO stocks.there is no baseline as how high and how low it may go.Have faith in lender quick turn around to make a buck. If all fails go to Quicken Loan for a tuition loan because you are underwater...This is a joke right? The stock has traded for two days and you are upset you bought at the ATH? The IPO price was gettable. I put in an order pre market and it filled at 18.00.There is a lesson in that, don't follow anything you see on WSB, i look at wsb to laugh and also in disbelief at the amount of stupidity and also occasionally luck you see there, I would never actually use that place as a source of trading or investing advice.

It is basically full of people with deep seated gambling issues who glorify losing several years of salary in a single shit trade. The reality is, for every post you see of somebody 'YOLOing' their account to hundreds of thousands of dollars, there are 10 people who did the same in reverse and are now in life changing debt. 

Think of it as an expensive lesson.

It may bounce on Monday and make new highs or it may tank and put you even further in the hole. 

Before mondays open you need to figure out if you are willing to risk even more downside to potentially break even or make a profit, and create an exit strategyCome on man. $RKT has been trading for less than 2 full market days. Relax, enjoy the weekend, and start thinking long term. This was not a bad decision today if you are long term.Dude you are fine! 3 months from now people would be dying to have gotten in at 26.50.......Bro, RIP.This is not wallstreerbets where retarded stuff like that is acceptable. Don't invest in stuff like that if you can't afford the loss...This can‚Äôt be real.Next week when options open up start selling covered calls to bring your cost basis down.

Great advice all the new people getting into investing need to see.Probably hold and hope it goes in in the next month or soBruhLol.

Hopefully that is the case, just gotta be patient and hold.....Ik, hopefully this stock doesn't crash to $1Lol OP just got immortalizedPlease do not advise a beginner to get into options.470If your going to take that much of a risk, why not just put it in something more stable like $VOO?Good manHow many shares did you buy?Ther is a lot of people day trading it right now.. it‚Äôs going to keep growing.. great company .. love this stockWhole tech sector have been falling today, which rocket considers itself to be as well. I think it will continue growing on Monday. Though of course no one knows.Huh? This will be up again on monday.. not sure why you're panickingI hope that's a joke and not an announcement that you don't even know what the company is/does.Huh?It‚Äôs not ‚Äúrocket‚Äù science to sell covered calls.At least I'm giving him the safest option strategy available for his situation, plus he seems the type to wander to WSB and go down a much worse path than covered callsBuy 30 more and then you could sell 5 covered calls above your cost basis and get your losses back and then some of you play things correctly. I expect the stock to go up anyways unless the broader market takes a dump. Whatever you do, do not sell covered calls below your basis or even sell them in the first place until you figure out what they are and how they work.I will have to look into it470There's no guarantee that tech continues its climb higher.

Tbh, you'll be fine. RKT is a strong company, the whole market kind of took a dump today so everything suffered.You're a college kid who dropped 10+ grand into a random stock because you heard about it on reddit?

You have to be trolling. No one can be that dumb? Surely?

I earn a 6 figure salary and have 350k spread across various investments and I only felt comfortable chucking 250 bucks at it.

Think this is enough Internet for me for today...Wait are u that person that posted yesterday about putting ur parents money they gave to u for college in stocks?
Please tell me noPlease don't and just STOP, and take a deep breath. Do not get into options (options = gambling) unless you are experienced.

You're better off  just waiting for the stock to break even and GTFO or wait till it reaches $30 and sell ASAP. You have plenty of time to recover, its an IPO debut from a good company (it should go up a bit more next week). No need to sell at a loss yet unless college is due then you might have to take a loss.

Live and learn and be careful with anything posted on /r/wallstreetbets that place if for gamblers and YOLO plays.Just make sure you always sell options instead of buying them. And if you sell options, don't sell unless your contract is covered by cash or shares, otherwise you'll end up like one of those people that make the news for how much they lose. Don't get greedy either, stick to low risk low reward starts when you are messing with money that isn't yours to lose and easily replace.I'm crazyTo be fair to RKT, they closed up nearly 16% today, OP just happened to buy at the worst possible time.Sell covered calls once options become available to collect premiumI learned a lessonI honestly hope it works out for you, but in all seriousness I hope you learn a valuable lesson from it. Don't spend money you aren't afraid to lose on investments. And due actual due diligence and research. There is a lot of good information on these subreddits, but there is also a shit ton of terrible information.Hopefully im a few days or weeks I will be in the greenI mean...

Can you please tell me what your thought process was when you went through with it. I'm genuinely interested.I think you'll be ok. I believe fair value is well above what they're trading at now. We aren't likely to see a rate hike any time soon and they're a great, cash generating business on paper. 

But... anything can happen, which is why you don't play with money you can't afford to lose (I realize you know this now.)Well this whole summer I've been bored due to quarantine so I've decided to take a risk and put my money into this stock. I guess you could say I'm like a gambler. I was thinking of only putting a few grand in but my thought process was like "go big or go home". Yes in hindsight what I did was retarded (me trying to get rich quick) but as with any new investor I will learn from this mistake. 

 Hopefully in the coming days, weeks or even months I go into the green.Well I think you're going to get lucky with this one. I'd say it's more likely to go up than down but for the love of God, do not think this makes you some kind of genius and never do it again.

Only invest what you can afford to lose. You are absolutely crazy doing what you did and you will wreck your life if you carry on.You have no control whether you short call is exercised.  This is up to the person who is long.  Even though your short calls was out of the money at 4pm, SPY could have continued to go up after hours.  The holder of your short call has until 530pm et to decide whether to exercise or not.  If SPY continued up after hours, you would be at risk of assignment on your short call.

Your broker was not willing to take this risk and closed your position.Did you have the funds to cover a potential assignment on your short call?

Usually the risk department at retail brokerage houses takes action to protect themselves from an assignment where you don't have the funds to carry the position.

Remember that SPY trades until 4:15 PM EST so they probably protected you (well they're protecting themselves) from potential after hours action (SPY going above $336), since the trader who is long the call you're short has until 5:30 PM EST (90 minutes after the close) to potentially exercise his long call. 

In order to avoid this, next time close all your spreads so you don't get a surprise like this (or even worse if SPY had gone higher after hours).Good reason to use XSP instead of spy.
Cash settled, no early assignments.unless you have $36,000 in cash in your account, Never hold short positions to expiration unless you‚Äôre comfortable...by not having that cash in your account, your broker isn‚Äôt comfortable either.It may be the 15 minute delay in trading transactions. Real time trades require a membership fee, i think.So that means, someone exercised their long calls even though it is OTM?Shouldn't matter if I had the fund to cover a potential assignment.. 
The broker shouldn't be able to sell my options position unless it has been exercised. 
Even if the stock goes above 336, the max I can lose is the Amt I trade (since it's a vertical spread )

I let my options expire all the time, however, I only get assign if the strike in ITM. This is the first time it got exercised while it was OTM.. 
Which is why I was confused.Thanks.. will try it next time üôÇNo, it means your broker didn't want to take the chance of that happening, so they closed your position.Could have been an institutional buyer covering some short shares.    
The big guys have a completely different trading methodology.It matters to your broker so it should matter to you as well. They are protecting themselves.

They have the right to do it, it's in the contract you need to agree to when you opened your account.

It's simple. Close your spreads, pay the extra $0.05 or $0.10 and you avoid these situations.Within a few hours of expiration most brokers will stop allowing the long leg to hedge the short leg. Instead you must be able to handle an assignment on the short leg on it own from your account equity or they will sell you out. This is a protective measure since there are circumstances (see my comment above) where the long leg won't act as a hedge as expected.It happened to someone on r/options. In his case, he got hit with an x div date. Person wanted assignment on all the shares and he couldn't cover.This right here. Let's say SPY goes to 336.50 at 4:05pm and you are assigned on the 336. Your 337 are still OTM so you let them expire. Now you're short 100 shares of SPY without cover. Trump announces a cure for COVID over the weekend and SPY gaps up to 350 on the open on Monday. Do you have enough cash to cover your loses? Didn't think so. TDA doesn't either so they closed you out to avoid this from happening.Hmm, but as long as they are options.. the lost is mine right? The broker doesn't lose any $..

 Only if the option is exercised then it becomes an issue and they will sell .. which is what possibly happenHmm but the stock didn't go to 336 after 4pm.. 
By your example all OTM will be assigned .. 
There will be no such thing "OTM options will expire"

I always let my options expire, this is the 1st it got assigned and then sold while it's OTM.. 
So I was confusedYou could potentially (unlikely, but possible) get assigned after hours, get a huge adverse move over the weekend and owe let's say 1 M by monday morning which you may not have (or you may but bear with me for the example).

Then it's not your problem, it's THEIR problem since they still have to cover for your losses to your counterparts. This is what they are trying to avoid because it's happened in the past.Yes, the stock didn't go to 336. But it *could* have, which is what your broker was trying to protect against. In the scenario I describe, the broker ends up having to cover your losses. They make sure they won't be in that position by closing you out.> Hmm but the stock didn't go to 336 after 4pm 

Your broker has to make that decision before 4:15 PM without knowing what will happen between 4:15 PM and 5:30 PM so they err on the side of caution (which they have the right to do)Options can exercise after hours, which entails enormous risk because the UL can gap against you. Unless you get hilariously lucky like that one guy whose long leg expired but he woke up to a 112K profitHmm.. but my option expires today, not valid over the weekend..But that's an assumption yes? It could as well gone down to 330.. I would think brokers would use a more solid reason.. 
Like if that's the case, where will they draw the line? 
If my strike price was at 340 or 350 instead, would they still have sold it? 

I mean the vaccine could have be found at 4:15pm and spy would shoot up to 380.. there also an assumption. So does that mean no OTM expires?Again that's an assumption yes? 
What if I an a strike price of 340? There is also a possibility that the stock will shoot up to 340.. 
Does that mean no OTM option will expire? All OTM are in danger of assumption?It expires at 5:30 after hours. You get assigned you can't exercise your long leg until Monday. What happens to the stock price between now and then? If it's out of the money you got assigned on a short and didn't have a hedgeThat's the whole point of risk departments at institutions is to prepare just for the worst case "assumption." When people don't understand the pin risk and then get stuck with a massive loss that they won't cover. 

&#x200B;

If you want to remain exposed, just roll the positions out further but stay away from expiration.You get to keep all of your winnings and not have to share them with the broker. But you're more than willing to share your losses. Are you really surprised the broker doesn't want to let you play that game with them?

I don't know the exact level the broker is using to draw the line. But I believe the logic is that you must be able to sustain the requirement of the short leg without benefit from the long hedge at some point a few hours before expiration.Yes. This is one of the risks of holding short options into expiration. You may be closed out, even when it's OTM. A broker has tools that tell them when an account has a risk of going negative equity and they will close out when that risk is too high.**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

In rereading OP are you looking for a pure lithium miner play?The issue I have with lithium or any other "hot" commodity (see the rare earth bubble of several years ago - note the LIT etf still under where it was around 2011 - after the peak in 2011, it spent the next 5 years in decline) is that these sorts of things always ultimately seem to be a "trade" and rarely a long-term holding. Some commodity is hot, names ramp (including micro caps where it's questionable whether there's actually anything really there in the first place), more supply eventually comes online and/or customers start figuring out workarounds  and the bubble bursts. Then long period of bleh before bubble/bust cycle starts again. I like researching a lot of industries. I have no interest in trying to research the day-to-day supply/demand of the lithium industry in an attempt to try to understand where it is in the cycle.

People keep mentioning Panasonic because batteries. So when does that lead to this becoming a good stock? Because that 10 year chart is not appealing.  "There are so many different types of shares" - there's the ADR and the foreign ordinary shares. The ADR is $8.49 US. The Japanese shares are 891 Yen = $8.41 USD. The foreign ordinary shares (end in F) closed at $8.45.If the price of lithium goes up, ALB will do fineIf you want to speculate on lithium being orders of magnitude more important than it is today, I don't understand how paying 20x earnings would be a deal-breaker, especially in today's marketAlb is good don't worrySQM and LTHM are on my watchlist for lithium plays.I gave up on LIT, and just bought ALB and LAC a while back. I've done well on both, trading them a bit with peaks and dips. LAC is speculative still, so I only have what I consider to be a half position of it (not more than 5% of account).I‚Äôd look at getting an ETF so you are investing in a mixed bag of commodities. Less riskBuy the Evanescence AlbumI'm up nicely on ALBMany of these small companies will merge, get bought out or go out of business.

[**This is what I suggest.**](https://www.globalxetfs.com/funds/lit/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=lit&gclid=CjwKCAjwmrn5BRB2EiwAZgL9onh4whG7ewvxiaTYyg27K7n7Nh_DWY-M-IVXggfjfJUXXk1-LgOfIRoCMoYQAvD_BwE)Invest in BTCI second LITYes, I looked into the LIT ETF, and it seems interesting, I think though I am looking for mining.Why is investing in lithium ETF the same as investing in lithium as a commodity? Is it possible to invest in lithium as a commodity like gold? Is there a gold etf that shows commodity type returns because it is tied to gold? Trying to learn.when you say you done well on both what exactly do you mean, what were your price entry points? 

and what made you buy them - did you do due diligence, Fundamental Analysis, or technical?That's good news! do you recommend it?

What made you purchase ALB stock?

did you do fundamental? what was your price point if you dont mind me askingThank you for that

because of the current climate I am a little hesitant to invest in this ETF considering the majority of its holdings are in China - given what is going on now, I would like to steer clear, or until more news comes up causing a further decrease, which may infact provide a buying opportunity.do you mean bitcoin? no thank you. 

Can I know why you think thats a good idea? or even how that answers my question.bitcoin has people so fucking mesmerized they are actually beginning to think it‚Äôs a rare metal. We are seeing the evolution occur right before our eye. Lithium batteries are old news. This dudes gonna build BITCOIN BATTERYYou could (hopefully) use profits (hopefully!) from investing(?) in artificial scarcity (BTC) to fund Lithium!How do people not expect automatic position closing? RH explains this everywhere. Close positions yourself, or have $143,500 available in case you get assigned. Otherwise you know what happens.Nothing against Enphase, but SolarEdge‚Äôs string inverter technology is catching up. The biggest drag on the string inverter was the weakest panel dragging the whole system down. This was resolved with optimizers attached to the panels. The next drag on it was the warranty - 12 years compared to 25 years with Enphase. That is being resolved by the installation companies paying for the extended warranties, equalizing the playing field. Add to it the fact that the string optimizer is more efficient, as well as allows for easier connections to charge electric cars, and it appears SolarEdge will have the... edge.My take on ENPH is that there's going to be increased demand in the residential solar market, which is where almost all of their microinverter sales come from. As the residential market grows, Enphase's business will grow along with it. They also recently started ramping their battery storage business and hope to have an "attachment rate" of 8-10%. This means they hope to sell energy storage to 8-10% of the customers who install panels with the Enphase inverters. On their investor relations page, they expect this to increase their revenue per household from $2k to $10. I can't say exactly how they will perform over the next several years, as it really depends on the management team's ability to perform on their vision. It certainly has potential to grow a ton in the future, although that is partially priced into their stock price as they have a 58 P/E ratioI'd listen to their recent earnings call or read the transcript if you're interested. The inverter business is a higher margin one than panel manufacturers but IMO, you can't go wrong with renewable energy companies as long term investments. 

I own shares of ENPH and SEDG, along with CSIQ, JKS, FSLR, BEPC, WVDRY, and TPIC. Most of them had earnings this week if you're interestedWhat would be your general timeline regarding SolarEdge gaining market share on Enphase and string converters?Quick google search shows they are not too far off - Enphase at 53% and SolarEdge at 31%. With solar installations picking up and SolarEdge offering the cheaper alternative I think within 10 years they‚Äôll catch up.Would it be unwise to maybe look into investing in both?Nope, in fact the industry as a whole is going to explode as the product becomes more affordable and utility companies continue raising prices.Nice. I appreciate the responses.I considered doing the same.  But with how autistic the market is let alone this stock, you id highly recommend holding long term or to just wait for a swing where you can drop your bags off if you really need the 5k.  Don't risk losing it to a retard marketThey have earnings this week. Maybe wait and see if it pops?Who let this retard out of his cage from wsb?


And to answer your question, yes. Sel covered calls every expiration date to collect your premium and minimize that ginormous bagI been selling puts on GNUS to hope I might get assigned at $1.50. It seems like a fun little stock to play around with, with decent upside. 

There seems like decent enough volume with GNUS options. One thing you can do is simply sell long dated options close to your break even point. If they go past the strike price then great you have premiums plus the tiny profit. More important you get rid of those bags. If not then it expires and your bag is a little lighter. The benefit to this is that you are guaranteed a profit. 

You could also set the strike price for a loss and collect more premiums faster. You might win, might lose. It‚Äôs just a risk/reward balance you wantSell some $1.5 puts to avg down maybe. I have my avg cost on 1500 shares to 2.50$ and it helps a lot by being able to sell 2.5$ calls and still be overall profitable even if it would hit my strike. Helps to make .05 to .1 per share every weekI like this idea. No risk at all. 

If you can get enough shares, swing trade the hell out of it. No risk at all. Not like going the options route.This. If you are planning to hold your shares through earnings, definitely wait until after earnings to sell the calls. If you sell your calls before earnings you will get the extra $100 but you could be sacrificing $1000's if it jumps significantly to the upside.Also, what‚Äôs the spread on the options. And volume on the options. 

Options can be far less liquid than stock. Best to check first.... if the answers are bad, you‚Äôre not going to be able to recoup, if the trade is going good OR badDo we know the date/time of the earnings call? I couldn't find it online.Oh my bad, I thought I should post here instead of wsb. Sorry!You aren‚Äôt guaranteed a profit. The underlying asset can still decline in price.

I would advise you to sell covered calls as well. My friend is knees deep in gnus and has been selling FDs for the last month or so. He is recouping his loss nicely. Especially before IV fell. However with release of toys coming out to amazon, etc. and licensing on children‚Äôs masks this ER can possibly make a lot of noise in the stock price regarding forward guidance. Id wait until the end of next week to begin selling any cc.Wdym by spread and liquidity? Sorry, I just learned about covered calls and haven‚Äôt learned the other basic terminology yetShows 8/13 pre market.I‚Äôm jk lol. Yes though bro sell covered calls it will help reduce the 5kYou did the right thingProbably phrased that wrong. I meant if he is bag holding at $5 and puts a strike price at $6. If the stock goes to $20 he is still locked in that profit of $1 per stock. I guess you could say opportunity cost, but that‚Äôs another issue. The longer dated ones higher strike prices have some interest. 

I‚Äôm still working on getting some shares. I know how volatile penny stocks can be so I really don‚Äôt want to get caught at a price higher than 1.50. Selling another put for next week, but we will see what happens to the priceSpread is the distance between the bid and ask of an underlying (something).  In options, every cent is a dollar, so it‚Äôs not minute. 

To make matters worse, the bid you see listed is often just like the last transaction. There may be no more transactions coming. Some contracts just will not sell, ever. Looking at the bid alone can be misleading. You need to see volume also.  

If something won‚Äôt sell, it‚Äôs not liquid. High liquidity means it‚Äôs easy to move around, and these questions were directed at determining how difficult getting value out of the option contracts would beThe $2 Aug 14 call is $0.10 at $0.15. Meaning it can be bought for $0.15 and sold for $0.10.

If you sell the option, you'll receive $10. If you immediately want to buy back the option, you'll have to pay $15. That's a 50% loss. To break even, you'd need the option to decrease 50% in value.

$0.10 at $0.15 is the "bid" at "ask". Think of an auction where people place bids to buy. The bid is the price buyers are willing to pay. Similarly the ask is the price sellers are willing to receive.

If you want to sell the option, you have sell it to buyers. Hence you receive $0.10 x 100 = $10.
If you want to buy the option, you have to buy it from sellers. Hence you pay $0.15 x 100 = $15.Yes but that‚Äôs if the stock reaches the strike. For an overall trade you also need to look at the asset. If you‚Äôre holding an asset (which OP is) and it declines in value then you lost. 

When making cc you also need to look at the stock being sold. If you sell cc for .15$ and it decrease in value before expiration for more than .15$ then you lost money. You are making two bets simultaneously with ccs. 1) that the strike will not print by expy. 2) that the underlying asset will not decrease in value more than your premium. 

This is irrelevant though because OP is holding the stock indefinitely atm. If you have no intention of selling the stock at all for any reason (I have multiple why you [and my idiot friend] should have a long while ago) for an extended period of time then you should be selling ccs. Collect the premiums weekly and reevaluate weekly on the position. 

This week is one where I would sit and wait. The stock is holding and has what should be an interesting ER this week. This could be a better play to sell a cc later in the week OR get out of this investment.Ah ok I see. So basically the number that I see RH put for the limit price before I even enter anything is currently 0.10. Does that mean that‚Äôs what is recommended I put for my limit to sell calls? Also, yea I‚Äôm indefinitely bagholding as of now I do think they will be profitable q4/q1 2021 and will probably sell then, but for now, I just want to hopefully recover some of the losses I‚Äôve hadYes thank u for this explanation this is my current position. Bagholding until at least q4/q1 2021 when there is likelihood of profits, but for now, I just want to recover some of my initial losses. I understand that the value of the stock itself may go down, but selling ccs should help me mitigate that i thinkYup just sell some way OTM ccs if you want to get the ball rolling**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

Maybe try r/cannabiscultivation/have you ever thought of leasing your land to someone that knows all this?Probably you would get better advice by paying some consultant that knows his stuff about such things.

Just saying. Going by the advice of the internet when it comes to large investments is not really great idea :D

For sure there is a million little things you don't think of and is not mentioned online if you are going to go from seed to finished products. Might actually take 3 or 4 consultants if you want it done properly.Not knowing where you are from, in what I have seen in US.  Usually have a nursery to cultivate plants by cloning particular strains.  Open air though cheap, is not always the best as you have a lot of variables to account for in production.  Unless there is a restriction in number of licenses granted, growing is a low profit game.  It is the quality of the strain, quality of the refined products, and marketing.   If you want a solid set up, need a horticulturist for growing, chemist/pharmacist with experience in distillation as well as compounding.  This is just a beginning.Saying what country you live in would likely help a lot. If you're in Sweden vs Tanzania the answers are going to be radically different.I would be REALLY surprised if mass produced hemp and cannabis is grown from seed. A lot of time plant growers (in general) use clonal propagation or rooted cuttings from mother plants or tissue culture. All of these are faster than seeds and result in a much more consistent product. Growth from seed is much more variable.Careful what you're getting into. I'm not sure where you are at, but at least in the US this is still a shady business where almost all transactions are in cash And a majority of the operations are in a legal grey zone or more often outright illegal.

There can be a lot of tricky zoning laws, licenses, taxes, etc. To worry about.

Getting seeds and growing is easy, but I'd advise finding a consultant to help get all the legal and operational stuff in order for your first year. I know there are plenty of people out there in the states to help out with that.If you have >50 acres, just go for fiber or grain. CBD at such a large scale can get hectic. A lot of labor that people don't expect.Thanks, I already posted there. It¬¥s a big investment, trying to post in different forums to get different opinions.Yes, i¬¥ve thought about it. But we have ALOT of fertile land. We have other crops and some land is leased, but I know there is a big opporunity in this type of crops. Not only for CBD, but also for industrial cannabis wit a finished product like cardboard, paper, jeans, etc.You are totally right my good sir! We are actively looking for consulting, but I want to analyze every little detail and sometimes the internet surprises you! 

Maybe I find a great consultant in Reddit, maybe this is a shot in the dark... But I believe that their is no worst thing that not doing anything!I would like to do both. Currently we have 800 acres available!It doesn't peg itself to that # for life. The stock tanked or jumped, thus the volatility resulted in the req % changing as well.Congrats your stock moved risk categories, happens all the time. Most people don't max cash and margin on a single stock. You either need to sell some stock or give the brokerage more money.The best time to invest is as early as possible. You could put 50% of your savings into stocks that immediately crash to half of what you paid for them. If you're prepared for that and investing long-term, your portfolio will recover gradually. If you'd panic and withdraw everything at a huge loss, don't invest. Don't invest money you are unwilling to lose.It is a good time to invest but not blindly. Piling money into overbought stocks is a good way to lose money.

Consider defensive stocks?I noticed NVIDIA and Microsoft doing well... but I would look at gold, silver, and other precious metals value to increase during this time. Especially when  Trump fires that printing press back up...I feel like slowly building yoyr portfolio is the way to go for beginners. this gives you some space to buy low when stock drops, but also build confidence in a stock when it goes up. you may lose out on gains but you will be learning about the market and your habits at the same time. carefully not to get too greedy though, as you can grow too fast (currently learning about this now)Invest in batches. Say 2% every week over the next 50 weeks. Feeling frisky? Do 10% at a time once a month.Please only invest an amount that you would be willing to see lose 100% of its value. The best advice right now is just to keep your job and have a fair chunk of savings prepared in case you, unfortunately, get laid off. If you're insistent on investing, please don't go for individual stocks when starting, gradually invest in an index fund like SPY, VTI, etc until you gain more knowledge.Good time to short the USD imoTime in the market beats timing the market.Yeah I learned that the hard-way earlier this year. (investing $10k into SQQQ right before the oil deal and first simulus... lost $1k and pulled out)

Now just starting to put a small bit into various stocks that I plan to hold for years, but debating if I should go in deeper as my money has been sitting in a interest savings account that has dropped from 2% to  0.80% this year...for starters who are looking to swing for the fences on stocks currently riding on massive support but with a huge upside to precovid levels, where the only reason for poor performance is quarantine measures, check these out:

HUD

JWN

PLAY

SPR

VVI

NCLHWhat are some good gold stocks?  or do you actually buy physical gold and silver?Is vanguard VDIGX a good one?

I had some money in at the start of the pandemic but i pulled out before I lost too much.Not currently. This is about the worst time you could currently buy.What made you want choose an ultrashort etf on your first go round? Or is that just an example of your biggest lossI would look into Index funds, unless you have time to research each company. Dont invest in something unless you understand it to some degree.Hmmmm...

I'm not gonna pretend like I know much about it but as it says it's a dividend growth fund I sorta dislike them.  Vanguard's VTI is an incredibly good investment as it covers the total stock market but obviously nothing is gonna be safe. Personally, I'm investing in SPY which has been doing alright currently but that could change next week idk? Going for a total world fund is far safer than most index funds like I'm a little concerned about QQQ despite the massive growth just because it's not greatly diversified. 

Sorry if this isn't the best answer!Well there were daily losses around 1k DOW, my thinking was "the virus is going to devastate the economy so SQQQ day-trades seemed like easy money, and investing in normal stocks seemed pointless if the economy was going to collapse for the next year.

Little did i know, the stock market would bounce back so quickly with record job losses, profit losses, etc.  (was up $400, then down $1400 in 3-days)It's the perfect answer, thank you.

Maybe I'll try throwing a few thousand into two separate onesAh thanks, just be sure to have enough money for an emergency. Best of luck!Yeah I'm really smooth sailing financially, just have a bit too much money sitting around but not in the position to buy a house yet.I assume you're talking about a short put spread. Yes, that's a viable option. If you sell the long leg, you may recover the losses, but you also open your position up to undefined risk.

You should consider the change in IV as well. If IV decreased when the stock price moved down, there is a lower probability of a price swing to move the price back in your favour.Thank you!**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

I have an order open for Monday.They were going down all month prior to earnings week and then shit themselves on earnings. I'd probably wait till it settles at some resistance before buying.I think they might have become overvalued when there was a lot of talk going around about mandating body cams and moving police primary arms away from guns. So with that news kind of fading away, so did some of the hype of this stock. 
Still a good company, but without some positive news I don't see them getting back to and maintaining that $100 value they hovered at for a bit.This is the problem with all the analysis on here.  You always judge by a single day.  ‚ÄúThis dip‚Äù is them actually positive for the week.   How is that a dip?  4 earning days a year are not what move a stock.It would only be a wash sale if on July 3rd you bought at $5 and on July 5th sold for $1.If I were in your position I would take option A.

 Real Estate generally appreciates well over time and by having a mortgage vs renting you are able to retain much your monthly rent costs by building equity for yourself vs building equity for someone else. 

Trading stock is certainly more fun and can be more profitable, but it is also a lot more risky, as this past February has shown us. It looks like you have made an excellent return on your money so far, maybe it's a good time to take your profits and reinvest them in a longer term asset which you can actually enjoy and will raise your standard of living. It doesn't mean you have to stop trading though, take $5k or $10k and invest it like you had initially done.Don't tie up your money in real estate keep investing and living how you are you'll do much better in the long runThis sub is for stocks my duder/investinghttps://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/toolbox/links#wiki_current_.26amp.3B_historical_data

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*The drop in the dollar is based on exchange rate against foreign currency not specifically inflation. I don‚Äôt see the point unless you happen to live somewhere that uses a different currency AND you happened to have invested using a foreign currency right at the dollar valuation peak. If you invested a few weeks earlier the dollar value would be about the same as today.

Even then you wouldn‚Äôt do it the way you‚Äôve suggested. You would convert both the purchase and current prices to the desired currency and calculate the return.US dollar rising/lowering isn't the same as inflation.

But to your initial question, if you want to look at historic performance, you generally want to use REAL return aka. after inflation. This is generally accomplished by adjusting share price to account for inflation looking backwards (adjusting to today's dollar), and by subtracting inflation from expected return looking forward.I don't think so. If I am trying to figure out how well the S&P is doing I am comparing it to how the money would have done while sitting in the bank. My $2000 I had sitting around that I didn't invest didn't inflate during this time while the dollar lost some of its value.

If you want to capture the dollar than maybe compare it to some foreign indexes.Your time period is too short to matter.>	An example. $SPY is at $334 currently. HOWEVER, the US dollar has lost almost 10% of it‚Äôs value in the past couple of months. This means it would put us at a ‚Äúreal‚Äù value of ~$300. Should we adjust stock price for inflation when comparing it with historical value?

No it didn‚Äôt, exchange rate shifts are just relative movement in currencies due to expectations of real risk free rates.  

Inflation is not measured via currency shifts.You can see how investing in a Euro (or Japanese, or Swiss, or UK) fund would have performed over the same period (e.g. VEU). VEU performance between June 1st and now is +7.9% and EURUSD is +6%, so ~14% in USD terms, VOO in the same time period is only +9.4%

If you simple exchange your USD to EUR and not invest them you would under perform (6% vs 9.4%). EUR has negative interest rates, so you don't get any money but simply keeping the money in a bank account.

All this is a bit meaningless though since the time period is too short.  Check the performance of VEU vs VOO over the last 10 years. I would guess though VOO without tech / communication services stocks to have similar performance to VEU.I personally prefer stock prices in gold terms to get a sense of long term. For ex look at this https://pricedingold.com/sp-500/ 

Gives a much better sense of market vs 'real economy'.I guess if your goal is to determine the real growth of the company but I think most people just want to see the returns they would have made had they invested in certain time framesFor analysis, you generally use log returns (or regular returns to just get a percent return on investment). The actual price doesn't give you much information. Another option would be comparing price to a rolling mean. Volume can be examined in the same way.>No it didn‚Äôt, exchange rate shifts are just relative movement in currencies due to expectations of real risk free rates. 


I have always have had a bad time understanding interest rate parity. I mean, I understand it conceptually, but can't get my head around the idea of no arbitrage. 


Does it mean that it is impossible for people that trade FOREX to actually gain anything since that would be considered arbitrage? Any "gain" that they have, is exclusively on paper?Covered parity violations are an arbitrage. Uncovered are not. If I can earn 3% by buying a US Treasury, but 5% by converting my USD to GBP, buying gilts, and entering into a forward contract to convert my GBP back to USD at a guaranteed rate at the end, then that is a great (and arbitrage) opportunity. Uncovered rate parity more or less says "the difference in risk free rates between currencies should correspond to future FX changes due to an inflation difference." Does it hold? Not really. You can make money on currency basis trades. But you can also lose money. The lack of a forward contract makes the result unpredictable.Think of trading forex the same way you think of stock efficiency - in the sense that a stock can be perfectly priced and still move tomorrow on new information.  When it comes to global macroeconomics new information is is a constant river rather than a drip or occasional burst. 

Rate parity, in super simple terms, basically says that if you have two separate currencies, and A has a risk free rate of 1% while B has a risk free rate of 10% then converting your currency A to B and investing at 10% will not yield you additional return than maintaining currency A at 1%.

It‚Äôs important to remember that efficiency is not an absolute and does occasionally happen in shades of grey, but given how liquid FOREX is parity generally holds pretty well.  

This is why if you look at something like a currency hedged international bond index the returns will be fairly close to a domestic bond index.Correct, this was my understanding as well, which is why I had a hard time connecting it into interest rate parity. The forward contract is what creates the opportunity for arbitrage. Thanks for the clarification.Ah understood, that makes more sense.  Thanks for the explanation üëç.Sell

Buy if it dips.

If it never dips, oh well you still made 500%Yes$50 by September is very much in play. Nothing wrong with taking gains, but do so at your own risk.are you invested in them? insane story they have , it's up 33% today so maybe it's a hold it's a tough decision .They are up for grabs for 100 billion dollar funding by the rockefeller group.this things could go up to 200$ from 10$ overnight . It's a tough place to be inDo you know much about the company?Thank youBe careful about the word discount. Most of these companies are trading so far above their valuation, that are a real discount was back in the pre-COVID numbers. FSLY for example was trading at $23 pre-COVID. It fell to $11 at the lowest and hit a peak of $110 at the highest. I would still not considered $77 a discount for FSLY.

I just got burned by some bad stock movement on some cash secured PUT. I couldn't stomach the exposure on the second day of 20% drops and had to exit my position.

Just be aware that any stock that has gone up by 4x in 3 months can come down that same amount if their growth doesn't live up to the valuation.

Let me only comment on FSLY since it was the only one I had stake in. They were at a staggering valuation for having not posted any earnings. And their price to value ratio was getting out of whack, somewhere in the hypothetic 80's range. So even if the stock fell from 110 to 80 where it is now, you're still looking at a hypothetical valuation ratio of around 60s. This is on a product that doesn't have a very strong technology moat, and is driven by an non-diversified enterprise customer base. Unless you like playing slot machines, I would recommend you watch FSLY stock for stability before buying in. At least have the price level out for 5 days straight at some level of support and resistance before buying in. Otherwise, you'll have a huge loss based on both intrinsic (ie. valuation and customers) and extrinsic (ie. Trump going to war with China again).Alteryx. I believe it‚Äôs an overreaction and will bounce back quicklyAll so I can lose my money in every single one of themSquare (had amazing earnings) and Sea Limited for buy. Cloudflare too but I already hit my 250 short-term share goal.

I'll avoid Alteryx and Fastly. Any company that can drop 30% in one day can easily drop another 30%, so no Alteryx. 

And Fastly has no positive catalysts ahead for awhile. Earnings were meh and now we have 3 months of Tik Tok attacks from Cheetoh Benito till election day, so it could see a death by a thousand cuts scenario.Forget tech, if the market environment is very turbulent heading towards elections, I would invest in BRK.B . It still has big investment in Apple and fundamentally it has room to run.Without looking at prices or fundamentals, MDB is the leader in an excellent database technology which is very different from the historical relational database tech. I'll dive into the technicals soon but I plan on buying shares if their valuation isn't ridiculous.

Also I think the FSLY fear is overblown, Github is still using fastly even though microsoft owns them now. I can't say if FSLY is a good play because their price went up almost 400% this year before this week, so it's entirely possible they're overvalued.All money on SHOP!Why is that? They have high debt to equity ratio and over valuedYou don‚Äôt think that Sea Limited is overpriced? How far can it possible go? It‚Äôs been trading up for quite some time for no reason. I‚Äôve been watching this stock and trying to figure out the best point of entry. Any suggestions?Product is great, they are profitable, big data is a mega trend, they are a potential takeover target, they will recover quickly when covid gets better. Many reasons to be bullishSea is certainly over priced. This stock had piqued my interests but after some DD i‚Äôm out on it.K. Why would nt data citizens just code or learn to code python.
What happens to stock holders if that company is bought by another company?Alteryx is software that basically takes a lot of different data sources and makes them into something easily used. We use it at my company. 

Tableau is a bit similar. Was purchased by sales force at around 45% above market priceSo the tableau share holds were given Salesforce stock worth 1.45*tableau's last stock price?Basically tableau stock price increased by the offered price. I‚Äôm not sure if it was a stock deal or what, but probably. Either way a company‚Äôs being acquired will increase if the bid is higher than current price.**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

lolIts a game of roulette. Watch as Royal Caribbean posts some of the worst losses in history with an insane cash burn and no real timeline to sail again...guarantee the stock goes up Monday lmao. Get your calls while you can!The company has diluted the shares massively and not profitable. Too risky. FYI I live in Norwaythat is correct.Just bought a bunch. Put 1/6 of my portfolio in NCLH. Here‚Äôs the thing, and it‚Äôs the same for something like Dave and Busters or movie theatres. Have you ever heard the saying ‚Äúif one tenant can‚Äôt pay rent, it‚Äôs the tenants problem...if the whole building can‚Äôt pay rent, the landlord has a problem.‚Äù A lot of lenders understand that there simply aren‚Äôt enough strong other potential tenants for space or ships, so waiting this pandemic out and allowing the tenants to get back on their feet is wayyy better than foreclosing and the having an empty boat or building. If you kick PLAY or AMC out of your property, you have a large, specialized facility or cruise ship to now fill. Knowing that quarantine will be lifted in the next few months. So buy NCLH, I did. Their lenders will be amenable, and they‚Äôve been very public about the fact that right now things are tough but they‚Äôve already booked up all of 2021. As soon as the quarantine opens, they have full ships already sold out nonstop. They have strong support and huge upside so go for it.The guy is talking about Norwegian airlines...Well maybe he should switch to NCLH instead lolHaha true, it is a better play in any caseSome can help me please? ü•∫**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*Personally I agree. That‚Äôs why I bought shares todayI bought today at $120. Small investment as i am doing it purely based on financials and without understanding their business model. I think just based on earnings the drop is exaggerated and the stock is oversold. It should be an easy 10-20% up by the end of Q3.I‚Äôm waiting to see next week‚Äôs price action. I‚Äôd rather buy it on the swing back up than try to catch a falling knife.

Agree with the others here on its long term potential.Personally I use Alteryx and am a technology consultant. Alteryx is one of the easiest ETL tools around and is extremely visual. 

100x better than say using traditional Excel macros and allows people who don‚Äôt know coding to automate processes.

I am an investor as well and plan to hold long term. Certainly the recent drop presents a good opportunity to buy in.

Obviously do your own DD but it is a well regarded platform by many, also has a strong community behind it.Very impressive clients list, benefiting from digital transformation. I think long term it‚Äôs a good company to invest in. Will it drop below $100? Such a significant decline in one day is concerning. What is a good price to open a position?Tableau is a front-end tool, used by thousands of people within a company. This is more of a back-end tool, used by developers?Maybe. At -29% in a single day (!) it looks intriguing, particularly because I've seen stocks like SMAR make 10-20% move down in a day, only to be gobbled up by hungry (greedy?) buyers in the following weeks bringing the price to new ATH - this is the crazy market we're in right now thanks to the Fed and the central banks around the world.

Looks like a spec play to me, so I wouldn't call it investing. It's valued at 1447 P/E right now (!) which is absolutely insane. I understand buying AMZN at 120-150 P/E but this seems way too out of whack. But hey, in the short term, maybe buyers will bid it back up and you can ride the wave, idk.I don‚Äôt see their foundation for making money. I studied Data Science and it was nice, but I haven‚Äôt seen it in the business world since.>What are your guys‚Äô thoughts?

In general, if you are seeking advice from unqualified strangers on the Internet about a particular company, you have no business investing directly in that company, regardless of their outlook.

When you buy stock, you're literally buying part of a business. If you aren't familiar with the sector in which that business operates, stay away. If you aren't comfortable analyzing that companies financials, stay away. If you don't understand why you would own that business, instead of one of their competitors, stay away.

Index funds exist for people who want the returns of stock ownership, without the need or hassle of performing due diligence on each individual company. They are an excellent investment option for most people.I mean, excel macros arent the best comparison....

What about other ELT tools? Alteryx doesnt seem to be keeping up these days imo...

And by ELT i mean ELT. Im not that knowledgeable about Alteryx but I know companies like Fivetran, Stitch, xplenty are all much more scalable and modern solutions.

Your very example is the reason why I am personally anti Alteryx. Unless they want to rearchitect their product, arent they going to have trouble keeping up with these other tools in todays data landscape?I'm taking care of an alteryx implementation at work, it's used by say 1/10 of tableau usersz one of their most common use case is to prepare data for tableau (data cleanings pivoting, etc ) its target market is the business usersz tech savvy but not IT /codeTWAT response of the year.One thing I‚Äôll say is I work within the tax world. So that is where I get my context from. 

Alteryx is so visually easy to use and understand for non tech people like accountants that it‚Äôs caught on a lot. Made me a bit more bullish on it personally.

I don‚Äôt know much about the other companies you mentioned but they could be good too!Kind of a mix between an ETL tool and metadata/model tool right?YesOne of the things with options that can be very confusing is that, even if the "price" is good for you, that does NOT mean that there is actual demand for it.  Many times, you may see a price that looks great, but it turns out that the Bid-Ask spread is too far and there's no actual demand for it.Sounds like wide bid ask. Give the ticker and maybe someone that knows that stock can comment.

You can leg out, but unless you hit the ask to buy to close, it may not fill either. Legging out adds the risk that one leg fills and the other leg moves sharply against you. This can happen if there is big news.

Sounds like you are on RH. Click through to see the bid ask. If prices are wide, it's going to be difficult to adjust or exit. If market is wide, the mid price shown by RH may be near meaningless.cause it involves buying to close and selling to open at once. best bet is to just keep decreasing your close price by one cent until it fills if you really need it to close**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

Maybe German government bonds. If it has to be bonds which is ... Peculiar, to say the best.Did you time travel from the 1980‚Äôs to be here with us today?
Bonds are no longer lucrative, cash is shit and QE printing of money means you‚Äôre better off putting your money into stocks.

If you‚Äôre feeling brave and you don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre a bubble, you‚Äôre best off investing in an ETF.Haha yeh I know it's low yield but I think interest rates still top that of a private pension fund right?Haha well I was reading up on the use of government bonds to pay back defects and noticed pension companies use them and then thought I had a genius idea that I could get better rates then my pension really. Obviously I'm hurt to find out my idea was laughable at best but one can try and find ways to turn their hard earned money into more hard earned money. The whole landscape of investment is harder for me than quantum theory.

Curious why German bonds?Wow and lol. I asked a question because I'm a novice. If I was an expert I wouldn't be here would I? Fascinating that keyboard warriors even stalk investment groups on Reddit. 

On the investment subject...thank you for elaborating with some actual advice (albeit wrapped up with sarcastic insults). I'll look up EFTs.Not at the moment. You'll get a better return in  a 1% savings account. And if interest rates start to rise in a few years time, bond prices will go down.

Depending on your age you probably want mostly equities in your pension. The more bonds you have, the lower the overall return.People who sound like they know it all don't actually know shitI think his reply was quite light hearted actually, but he‚Äôs right, bonds aren‚Äôt a great investment if you‚Äôre young. Basically a tiny but certain return. They used to be all the hype, but not now. Just get a global index like FTSE global all cap.

Download a stocks app such as Hargreaves Lansdown (in the UK) set up your ISA within the app, and just invest in a global index. Not individual stocks until you know what you‚Äôre doingNobody expected you to be an expert, this is Reddit.
I‚Äôm giving you solid advice and you‚Äôre complaining, DYOR research instead of asking about shitty yields on government bonds.Hmm thanks for that information. That random thought is now getting squashed!I might not know a lot but if you want to buy bonds in 2020 then I have a bridge in New York to sell you.Appreciate that and I'm sure on second thoughts it was meant in that light hearted way but you have to read a room first. If it was a mate who said that I would laugh but I'm asking a legit question in a group because I'm completely naive about a subject and the first response is a joke about how dumb I am for even asking. The key to a good joke is timing and I personally wasn't feeling the timing of that one. Appreciate your comment though and the tip about the app is great I'll do that!

(Those are just the tech, I've also had gains from NVAX, INO, KOS & DAL)Actually sounds pretty solid, I've had more success with mid cap growth stocks but I'll have to try out the DOWHonestly I think it‚Äôs a good stock long term if you want a lot of upside but there will definitely be some big dips along the way. If you are just trying to swing it then yeah I think taking some profit would be wise at 19.AER is also a very easy one. Highly overlookedI don't have much to invest which one would you recommend?Cheers. What was with with run up in casinos this week? Can‚Äôt get my head around it, what was the good news?!"something safe like spy"

Looks at chart for SPY in March 2020 ...>What am I missing?

What happens if the price drops below what you bought in at? You collect the premium but now you're stuck bag holding the shares on margin or you end up selling at a loss wiping out that premium you gained or worse.

If you decide to bag hold and continue to roll the same strike price on your covered calls, after it drops, your premiums won't make up for the margin costs as you'll be more OTM and those strike prices will collect less. If you adjust your strike price on your covered calls to earn more premium, what happens if it spikes back up? You gain the premium but you lose all your shares at a price lower than what you bought in at.

A strategy most people use is called "The Wheel" where you sell cash secured puts, if you lose, then you either cut your losses and repeat or bag hold the shares and sell covered calls.Maybe buy a LEAP put to cover against a crash. Then try not to sell your shares for less than what you bought them for. 
I am new to trading though, so maybe not.I had the same thought.The return is fair for the risk involved, you are underestimating the risk.I opened an IBKR margin account to try this in early July. Instead of trading covered calls I decided to sell puts at about 150-175% of my total account value. From what I read you don‚Äôt actually pay margin on selling puts, but I could be wrong. Either way they only charge 2.5% (based on my account size and account type). I‚Äôm targeting an annualized nominal return on the puts of about 6-10%, which would give me 15%ish annualized return on capital (with increased buying power of margin account). These are puts that a pretty far OTM, and the ETFs or stocks would have to drop 10-15% to get assigned, which I‚Äôd be okay with. I like the risk/reward of this, but that is a personal taste.Yeah seems like these outliers happen and we need to account for that.

What happens if my account suffers a 30% drop and i cannot fulfill the margin call. Can brokers come after my other personal property?> Can brokers come after my other personal property?

Well, first they come after all your cash and assets in your account. While charging you interest and penalty fees. What happens next if you stiff them, I don't actually know, nor do I want to discover the hard way.**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*I own BST and BSTZ. They are not ETFs. They are monthly income funds which are actively managed CEFs. The ER is pretty low for what it is.

The 5% yield is not a dividend, it's a distribution from a trust. This means it might be made from dividends, STCG, LTCG, ROC, premiums from covered calls, etc.  If they don't have NII they will pay out of the NAV in ROC. If they make more than 5% there is a chance they will issue a capital gains distribution in December. The 5% is not  dependent on the unlying securities dividends.

The other thing you needs to understand is that the NAV and share price are not linked. The market sets the price. Currently is it very close to NAV but it can vary depending on what is happening.

I don't know what charting website you are looking at, [but if you look at total returns they have done better than QQQ since inception.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=2&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2020&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&showYield=true&reinvestDividends=true&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=BST&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=QQQ&allocation2_2=100)The holdings in BST are different than QQQ. Also, a dividend yield is not that desirable to some, because dividends are taxed at both the corporate and personal levels.

Top ten holdings of QQQ:

Well for one dividends are not free money so it does not matter if the dividend is higher than the expense ratio

Two , the 5% is a distribution not a dividend, it comes from the fund selling its holdings or re-balacing, just like a dividend its a net zero gain , you just have to pay taxes on it.

You are paying 1% of a generic tech fund that will distribute a large tax liability to you .Is this the one with monthly dividend?QQQ outperforms BST in the 1 and 2 year range.  Although they are almost tied at the 5 year range.  BST beats QQQ some years, but not most and not enough to justify the higher expense.  It looks like most of BST's growth was in its first few years, which is common for ETF's.  Its recent performance lags QQQ and other tech/growth ETF's.


Vanguard's ETF for tech is VGT, which beats both BST and QQQ.If you're interested in growth go with ARKK/ARKW, not BST.You also have CII and BME which both have lagged the Vanguard equivalent VOO and VHTROC gets confused for real returns all too often.>just like a dividend its a net zero gain

I don't think the OP's ticker is a good investment, but this statement is not true.  It's not a "net zero gain."  Dividends come out for the retained earnings calculation.  It is independent of the market price of a security except for the first 15 minutes of market open of ex-day.  After that, the market takes over and determines the price of the stock just like anything else where NAV and the price are not connected.Keep in mind that BST is more diversified than QQQ, which is likely partially why it has under-performed.And how it can impact capital gains tax.> Dividends come out for the retained earnings calculation. 

So you just acknowledged its a net zero gain here....No I did not.  Unless you're the sole stockholder of a corporation, what they have for retained earnings has no direct effect on you as a stockholder.  If you are the sole shareholder then it's different but then you're also the one paying taxes and filing your 1120 returns.

Downvote all you want, I know how taxation works, how securities are priced, and I know GAAP.  You're wrong on this one.It's simple math. If I have a bank account with $1000 that I have built up after paying all expenses, then pay out $100...my bank account is worth $100 less...I think as long as anyone stays long in LVGO or TDOC they will make out great on this. I doubled up my TDOC position today while it‚Äôs a little low right now. This combined company is going to to dominate the telemedicine space in my opinion.I think I‚Äôm going to average down on TDOC...In the short-term you will probably see more volatility in either direction. Long-term I would expect the merger to be beneficial to shareholders.

EDIT: If you want to look at recent mergers $VSLR and $RUN come to mind, but don't put too much weight into price movements from mergers in different sectors with different stipulations.Might be better to average down investing in LVGO.Good point. ThanksConsidered doing both but I‚Äôm out of cash for now haha. Hoping long term it‚Äôll pay off.Why is that ?LVGO = TDOC \* 0.592 + $11

LVGO = $121.95

TDOC = $195.15

Buy 0.592 of TDOC = $115

Buy 1 LVGO = $121.95 - $11 = $110.95 = 0.592 TDOC

So basically buying 0.592 of TDOC is $115 and buying 0.592 of TDOC through LVGO is $110.95.

I think I did my math right? Also if the merger falls through then LVGO will go back to growth city and moons will be made.Normally both stocks will go up. I had a lot of LVGO and my stop loss was triggered. Made a little over 3k on profit. Normally the company being acquired gets the pump on the news or closer to the merger completion date. However TDOC will go up as they will be the "heavyweight". I'm looking to jump in on TDOC for long term.üôèWhat price will trigger you to buy TDOC? i bought quite a lot yesterday but it kept dropping today. Dont know when i should load up againI bought today when it hit 191 and change. Bought $6000 worth. If it does decide to dip I'm prepared to lower my average. 190-195 in my opinion is a steel!!!Right. The margin interest is fixed, but the credit you earn from the CSP is not, so whether it is a net win depends on a lot of luck.

If the stock declines, any benefit you would have gotten for covering the short may be canceled out by the loss on the CSP, so it works both ways.

Personally, seems like doubling down on risk when you are already out on a limb.It depends on your capital and whether you can keep the position or not. 

If capital is not an issue and you sell a put against your short stock position just remember that synthetically you will have re-created your short call (short stock + short  put = short call) so you are completely exposed on the upside (on top of the short interest you mention).I invested into it. It looks like a slow and steady gainer in my opinion. Their products are amazing so sales should never been an issue.I am in on it since it was around $20 and have been adding to it since. I think it‚Äôs a solid stock- people will need their products regardless of the economy, their debt isn‚Äôt crippling, and they pay dividends too.Same. Holding CARR and have had some steady gain so far. 

Unsure as to exactly what‚Äôs driving their growth beyond providing a promising product though.I was excited when they decided to have a dividend. Made me think longer term with them. They are a global beast. Their website makes it sound like they are pursuing cutting edge equipment that meets the green thumb requirements too. In US of A people great real serious about leed certified buildings. Atleast in the dc area. Im sure theres a different term if not the same type elsewhere that means your building meets certain energy requirements. You can be a class A building. Charge more for tenants and probably tax breaks. I thinks thats a no brainer for any ac company. Sounds like their on it. Plus the government uses them and thats always a great customer to have. My biggest concern was i dont think they chose to be independent. They made some great feel good statements about going forward but im pretty sure they were forced out with ottis after the merger because of monopoly laws. But I think they have alot to offer and will be fine.Global warming and Northern Europe needing ac?Yup this!!!Didt trade overstock option yesterday but had an existing contract that I‚Äôm holding. It went up because online retail sale where up 70 percent  for the month of August. Before that there 3 major news that I can recall that help push it up. One being they beat some court case, the secound being they where one of 3 company that got a huge government contract that allows government employees to purchase stuff from them and 3, they beat on eps four folds and exceeded revenue a lot. That‚Äôs the 3 major one for the quarter but even before those news overstock was averaging about 5 percent a day. Think up like 2000 percent sense March**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

Not in the same way.

Technical analysis does have value.  That being said, I would never trade on technical analysis alone.  Like I don't trade through earnings.  I don't trade stocks I don't understand.  I don't trade when P/E ratios are beyond what I call common sense.

Support levels do exist, moving averages can matter, and there are other metrics that so many people use, it almost becomes a fundamental.  I think combining both fundamental analysis with technical analysis while sprinkling some common sense on top is the best way to make plays.Vix follows market 80% of the time with roughly 8-10x leverage.Vix is just market mood, it can change quicklyVix is not based on supply and demandTechnical analysis is the astrology of the financial markets, their proponents have every single excuse in the book for why a technical prediction fails:

* Obviously you can't trade on technicals alone

* The pattern just wasn't 'confirmed'

* Technicals give you an edge, it's going to result in some wrong calls

* some event happened causing the price to move unexpectedly, so the technical call wasn't wrong (but if an unforeseen event causes the price to move as predicted, then technical analysis works!)

* But the Fed!

And of course technical analysts love explaining things and saying moves were perfectly expected ..... after the fact.No since buying and selling of it doesnt influence its priceDoes anyone actually read this bot?It literally is. It is a measure of implied volatility. The "implied" means "what volatility matches the market price of the option," and market prices are a function of supply and demand.Buying and selling of VIX definitely impacts the price of VIX.It‚Äôs not traded 
I know how vix is calculatedKinda hard for it to have an impact through buying and selling, if you can‚Äôt actually buy it or sell it, no? The VIX is a mathematical construct. You can‚Äôt buy a formula. Now you can buy and sell derivatives on VIX or ETN‚Äôs that mimic VIX, but you can‚Äôt buy and sell the VIX.... Do you? So why don't you understand that VIX is a market price?Okay if you can't buy a formula then you can't use TA on it either...

Do you also give this pedantic lecture to people who talk about index values?No, because you *can* actually buy index funds and mutual funds, which include actual stocks that make up the indexes. This buying and selling *can* actually increase/decrease fund NAVs (net asset values) above and below their respective indexes. Or push up indexes by forcing mutual funds that are flooded with new cash to buy up more of the indexes again pushing prices up (or force liquidations which drive prices down as investors head for the exits).I can also buy SPX options to move VIX.Correct. But if you‚Äôre buying SPX options, you‚Äôre not buying buying the VIX, are you?Wow good point!!If you don't have experience, then you should just buy $VOO. It tracks the SP 500 and has a decent exposure to Apple for less risk.>it seems dumb not to buy now cause Apple stock is eventually gonna get back over 110 so why wouldn‚Äôt I is there a downside I don‚Äôt see?

Not that I know of immediately, no. 

>Also I always heard a lot about the S&P 500. Is like 5k enough to start invest I was thinking buy one S&P 500 share

You can't invest directly into the S&P 500 Index. However, you can buy shares of ETF's that hold all companies that are components of the index. SPY is the name of one ETF, although there are others. One share of SPY is going for $334.57, so $5k would get you 14.94 shares. 

>Some stocks for dummies guide or some general information about these ideas would be awesome thank you in advance!

Check out Investopedia. 

>buy 4ish apple shares before the split.

If you bought 4 Apple shares, post split, you'd come out of the split with 12-16 shares.Try r/valueinvesting and r/educatedinvestingMy best advice would be to only invest the amount which you'd be prepared to see completely gone tomorrow. Right now there is an insane amount of uncertainty and the best thing is to keep a secure amount of spare money in case you lose your job. Honestly, it seems that you're just starting out so I'd strongly discourage you to not buy individual stocks but buy an index fund, like SPY, until you gain some solid experience and understanding. We have no clue if Apple will surpass 110 as you said, there may be a sudden dip next week or something unpredictable like a scandal, nothing is 100% guarenteed, especially in the short-term.

Hopefully, this helped to give some advice, stay safe!No amount is too little and it‚Äôs never too late. I recommend investing in VTI if you are holding long term and do not want to be constantly reading quarterly reports of individual stocks. It tracks the total US market. It is not flashy, and many etfs and stocks will outperform it at any given time, but over decades, it is a safe investment. If stocks like Apple due very well, you will benefit, but you will also benefit if stocks you have never heard of explode. You are betting on not only the US, but the global economy, as around 35-40% of VTI‚Äôs revenues come from outside the US.You‚Äôre never too late. Always new IPOs, dips, rallies, and opportunities. Just do research, jump in, and make money (patiently).inb4 "this is the top"I agree with this guy, investopedia is a great tool and I would go on to recommend subscribing to their newsletter, they have explanations for every term you could ask about and the newsletter will summarize everything that happened today as well as what is coming upSo when people mention investing into the S&P 500 they mean ETF? And there are different types of ETF‚Äôs like SPY and SPY is on of the subsections you can buy?And so if I have money I am sitting on and literally in the bank I guess Apple isn‚Äôt a bad investment overallHm?Do you know of a resource like investopedia but a little more affordable?>And there are different types of ETF‚Äôs like SPY and SPY is on of the subsections you can buy?

Yes. There's SPY, VOO, to name twoSince you're new, let me point out something.

Shares + short call = covered call.

Long call + short put = synthetic long = shares.

Make sure these both make sense to you. Then...

Long call + short put + short call = covered call.

Short put = covered call.  They're the same thing. You don't need to own shares for the purpose of selling covered calls. Just sell a put. They're identical.I use a premium version of barchart.com exactly for this. There might be a free scanner somewhere, but i have everything already setup with filters for cash secured puts and covered calls to find things that will pay minimum of 3% weekly etcYes, a screener is a good starting point to look for stocks that fit your criteria. Just make sure that you would be happy to hold the stock long term. I personally wouldn't want to hold XRX in my portfolio.You mean equivalent. They differ in terms of taxes and dividends, and scenarios that are likely to lead to early assignment.And that‚Äôs exactly why I bring all my life‚Äôs problems to Reddit!! Thanks!Thanks for bringing this. I'm also new to options. Can you please explain why would you go for one form of CC over another? I.e. What are pros and cons of "Long call + short put + short call" vs "Shares + short call".

One thing which comes to mind is if you actually hold shares and increase your strike every time you also benefit from stock appreciation.Have you managed to consistently get 3% weekly?**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*Sorry, but selling premium on shares does *not* protect those shares. In fact, it exposes them to additional risk. That's how the market *works.* You're getting a higher return when selling premium, because you're taking a higher level of risk by selling premium. You're whoring out your 100 shares to write derivatives contracts... That's not protection.

'Protecting' your shares would be something like buying cheap, long-dated OTM puts on those shares. That way, if the value of the shares goes down, the value of the puts goes up and you hopefully just about break even. Notice how, in this situation, you're *paying* a premium to *reduce* your risk. That's how things work, conventionally.

When selling options, you're the one taking the *other side* of that deal. You're selling someone insurance; taking on their risk for a premium. You may be generating higher returns, but you're also taking on additional risk. There's no free lunch in the market.

All derivatives are a zero-sum game, and it's worth bearing that in mind. One man's gain is another man's direct loss. Meaning, when you're making money selling premium, someone else is implicitly losing money bagholding your worthless options. Equally, those YOLO plays you see on WSB where people made 3000% returns... Guess whose pocket those 'fat-tail' distributions of returns come out of? Yeah, the premium seller's.

Selling premium is a valid strategy used by some of the most prominent investors in the world. It is not, however, a risk-neutral endeavour and it offers no principal protection of any kind.

Also, selling premium on illiquid shares such as biotech stocks is stupid; how the hell are you getting out of those illiquid-ass positions if the position goes against you?Do not SELL options if you are learning about options from Reddit. You will get rekt and Robinhood will not refund you for being ignorant.I‚Äôve been hearing a lot about option and watched a video on them. Still not confident though. I have qyld which does the option trading for meBest way to protect your investment is to let time reduce the variability of the market, rather than trying to time the market.  There is no free lunch, and any other "protection" you are buying always come at the cost of premiums and/or reducing the potential on the upside.

People with less time left to invest should switch into more bonds/cash, but that's just another example of reducing your potential for the upside in order to gain more short term protection.Thanks for your input but I didn‚Äôt mention that protecting your position was free but as in insurance it is less than the potential total loss.Selling covered calls trades upside for income.  It doesn't protect the investment.  Same with selling puts on the way in.  Trades upside for income while retaining all of the downside.

This probably works out well over time as option selling tends to do, but you better be ready to miss out on the winners and get stuffed on the losers.You‚Äôve taken much of what I said out of context but thanks for the comments. Yes you get a higher premium on IV ‚Äúrisk‚Äù. So the biotech stock I‚Äôm in I have part of my position on covered calls for more than I paid by 25%. I got paid 20% just for the premium. So this is how I look at protecting it. I got paid for the premium and I have a limit sell order in a sense that ends in two weeks from last Friday. As far as illiquid, volume share average is 1.7 million. Option volume is lowish that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm selling premiums and most don‚Äôt exercise them anyways. I‚Äôm not looking to trade contracts if I buy an option but to exercise so volume isn‚Äôt important and low put volume makes them cheap if I decide to do that. I‚Äôll keep what you said in mind thanks again for the input.AgreedThanks for the input. Yes I should have mentioned this as more of a dividend ‚Äúprotection‚Äù. I‚Äôm just selling covered calls over my cost basis as I only do this with a portion of my position. I‚Äôm not sure what you mean by winners and losers comment could you explain?You're reducing your cost basis, that's what you're trying to say I think. 

My point is, that limit sell will only be executed if there are buyers. On an illiquid options chain, the likelihood you'll find buyers is way lower. So, I can foresee a situation where the position goes against you, and there are no buyers there to buy the position from you so you're forced to hold it.Sure.  Say you like stocks ABC and XYZ both trading at 100.  So you sell monthly 100 puts on both to get long.  

Assume ABC goes down to 90 and XYZ goes up to 110 over the next month.  Now you are long ABC at 100 (less the put premium) and you missed buying XYZ.

So next month, you sell 90 calls on ABC and 110 puts on XYZ.  Assume ABC goes down to 80 and XYZ goes up to 120.  Still long ABC at 100 while its trading at 80 and not long XYZ at 120.

You may think that the particular path I chose is highlighting some unlucky outcome, but try different scenarios (e.g. XYZ and ABC go back to 100).

Its like everything else, if the premiums are high enough and the moves are small enough this can be a good strategy.  But its not like its free money just waiting to be picked up.Yes cost basis would have been a much more accurate term to use. 
I look at it from this point I‚Äôm getting paid for a contract that rarely will get exercised. I only do calls bc I have a lowish cost basis. This stock bounces back and forth with little breakouts nothing crazy but moves a lot high volume so good IV for option premiums. I don‚Äôt do this with my whole position and this is a small percentage of my portfolio. I bought this stock just for this strategy as I know spy wouldn‚Äôt be good but ppl could still make premiums on calls while it was sliding down during covid. My greater point was to keep this in mind as another strategy to use.Thanks for taking your time yes I agree we could miss out. So here is my position right now I have company stock abc cost basis of 4.50 I have 300 shares I like but don‚Äôt love it good company but no breakouts to the upside. High IV but stock only moves from 2-5 dollars what do I do? Like I said I like abc but I‚Äôm missing out on other positions so I sell covered calls at a 5 strike on 100 shares I got a premium for 80$ for a month out call. The other 200 shares are liquid if it jumps up I can sell those. I‚Äôm not big on selling covered puts.There is nothing inherently wrong with selling covered calls as long as you understand that if your stock breaks out to the upside you are going to get called out of your shares.

Once upon a time I bought FB at $19.  Sold covered calls at $38 because it was up 100%.  Might be nice to have that back.

Of course I did the same thing with BP post deepwater horizon and glad I'm not in it.

In the end who knows, just know the trade-offs and be aware of the risks.If you‚Äôre in for the long long it makes no sense to speculate or try to pull out/time the market. Just hold all your positions (given you are confident with them) and buy more if it dips. 

If you don‚Äôt have the funds to buy more then id still recommend holding but I suppose I‚Äôd be more lenient towards say selling 30% and holding that in cash because it is more likely that there will be a dip than it is that there won‚Äôt be a dip. But regardless,  ‚Äòtime in the market beats timing the market‚Äô.Will Donnie go quietly? Or will they have to get the long overdue straight jacket out and whisk him off to a padded cell?

Seriously, Have some in market now, drip feed some more monthly and hold back a chunk for these uncertain times if another crash happens.There‚Äôs going to be increased volatility in the stock market around late September early October. I‚Äôm pretty convinced we‚Äôre going to have another crash but not as big as the one in March. The number of foreclosures is going to rise in October. Real Estate is going to crash by January. I‚Äôm going to pull out of most everything by mid September and buy back after the dip. I‚Äôm trying to save for a down payment so I can buy a house in February.You make your own decisions?Another Reddit warrior who is a wise ass on a forum but a scrub in real life.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*You are on the right track. 10-ks are great for getting a grapple on what companies are focusing on in the near term. You might think a company has huge upside potential in XYZ, but they might be focusing on IJK. 10-ks are also good when you are building cash flow models and want to get an understanding of what goes into their various costs. I.e., answering whether their gross profit margin is sustainable.I don't really find a lot of value in trying to analyze a 10-K.  Price targets are already set by equity research analysts who have already read them.

Instead I consume the equity research reports prepared by these guys who sum up things mentioned in the 10-K.  That's what they're paid to do.

Almost all good brokers have robust research departments who write these up and then places like Morningstar have them as well.

Hot tip:  Many public libraries have Morningstar subscriptions you can use for free.  So you don't have to pay $200 a year for Morningstar Premium.  Your local library (which means your tax dollars) already has.> I don't really find a lot of value in trying to analyze a 10-K. Price targets are already set by equity research analysts who have already read them. 

On a whole, the ones you see are set by sell side analysts, so you should take it with a grain of salt.Well yeah I don't work at a private equity firm or a hedge fund so I wouldn't have access to buy-side analytics but the concepts are the same.

People make this big distinction vs buy-side and sell-side but most of the time it's a moot point.  At the analyst level it's the same.PE funds usually dont produce reports for listed companies, not sure about hedge funds because to be honest i have never worked at one or with one. 

At the analyst level it is not even close to the same. We receive sell side reports from about 30 or so domestic brokers, the go into our internal data aggregator and are used for some smart beta strategies and thats about it. There exists a inherit conflict of interest when looking at broker reports. 

To give you an example, our buy-side reports average about 80-90 pages in length, while the sell side reports are 2-5 and usually only encompass company fundamentals.>At the analyst level it is not even close to the same.

Sell-side and buy-side analysts at PE firms and banks do almost the exact same thing for acquisition activity.  You're still a cost center at the analyst level.  There are still pitch books, checking Capital IQ or the Bloomberg Terminal (or whatever they have these days) and then fixing spelling mistakes in PowerPoints or filling in numbers into pre-built Excel sheets.  It's not very complicated.

It can't be because most analysts are under 24 years old.

>To give you an example, our buy-side reports average about 80-90 pages in length, while the sell side reports are 2-5 and usually only encompass company fundamentals.

I don't know if anything has changed, but firms that specialize in ER release some pretty in-depth reporting.  It's not the same as the 2-3 page summary every broker customer gets.  But then again ER as a standalone is somewhat dying because more firms are doing their own in-house ER activities.> or filling in numbers into pre-built Excel sheets. It's not very complicated.

Garbage in, Garbage out. Yes any idiot can fill in a DCF, but if you can't justify the underlying assumptions, it doesn't mean anything. 

Furthermore there is a lot more to company research than updating semi-reliable at best models. You need to do company visits, need to interview management, consult industry experts and most importantly (depending on industry) upstream and downstream confirmation and analysis. Macro and strategic analysis helps with timing, none of these services are usually provided by brokers. 

Furthermore you didn't address the inherent conflicts of interest with sell side reports, and that is brokers make money when people trade and their interest alignments is not necessarily with their clients. A sell-side analysts job is 1/2 analyst 1/2 marketing.>Yes any idiot can fill in a DCF, but if you can't justify the underlying assumptions, it doesn't mean anything.

Good thing analysts usually aren't asked to justify anything.  And they're never let anywhere near the client.

I agree, but that doesn't happen unless it's in a setting where it's paid due diligence or it's internal.

Not sure where the Japanese eV program is competing with mid range. I see a few compact eVs in the West coast but I smell these Li, Nio, Xpeg will be ahead of them. Thanks for your post.Can't seem to understand your question. "btw" you mean "by the way"?ATR is a measure of volatility, so the higher it is the more implied volatility the option will likely be priced at, since the stock is moving  more.  however, a stock could have a high ATR but not move much from open to close, and therefore the realized volatility wouldnt be as high.  rate of change would be a better statistic to use but I don't think experienced options traders use it in the way you are asking.


option profit loss is determined by your strategy and not causally from ATR.Between makes more sense from context.between**Hi, welcome to /r/investing. Please note that as a topic focused subreddit we have higher posting standards than much of Reddit:**

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*You‚Äôd probably need to be smarter than this post leads me to believe you are.Board members don‚Äôt always own a huge amount of stock.  They can simply be industry experts who are vested in the company‚Äôs success.No, no one cares about a .1% shareholder.If you're Warren Buffett you could probably grab yourself a board seat with 0.1% of a $40 million company. In fact, the other shareholders and the management would probably beg you to take the seat.Starting point is about 10% of the company where you would have enough voting rights to influence board membersI think you need to explore pico or femtocap companies if you're looking to impress people with a $40k holding as your main qualification. 1/1000th of a $40 million company isn't much, but with a much smaller company - say a $40,000 one - you could make yourself director!This is dumb question, and you know jack shit about how a public company is run.33%The answer is "When the company thinks you bring enough value to their business to justify paying you as a board member" percent.You can't just be a rich nobody. You'd have to be voted by shareholders, the CEO, and the existing board to get in, and many board members don't even have that much money tied into the company anyway.This world needs more brutal honesty like this.Hey I‚Äôm just looking for loopholesBut at what point can you sway yourself into one of those positions or get some small shareholder perks? Wouldn‚Äôt a .1% shareholder be bigger than most?Would you at least get free meals or make connections with the board? :(With a company that small you‚Äôd think they wouldn‚Äôt be pickyI read about bill ackman getting 2 directors with 9.9% so I wasn‚Äôt sureI mean show me one that‚Äôs not a pump and dump scheme and I‚Äôll look into it‚Äôs financialsThis is hands down one of the dumbest posts I have ever seen on Reddit. Not necessarily because of the initial question, but because of the responses OP provided to other redditors. OP both appears to know nothing about governance etc and to be openly willing to commit fraud.There are tons of ‚Äúold boys club‚Äù in many small caps on the board‚ÄúJust looking to scam my way in life with half cooked ideas where I want to ride the coat tails of others with contributing nothing‚Äù I translated it for you.Board members are voted in, you'd have 0.1% of the votes, zero expertise in the industry and no business experience.You can join a VC that needs representatives on company boards.  You won‚Äôt necessarily get stock but might get a bonus from your VC firm.A $40 million dollar company may be "small" compared to Amazon or Microsoft but they're not small enough that they're going to pay some random person to sit on their board.He is a well known investor. If he buys a 10% stake to make it known he is serious , other share holders take note.....

If some joe blow does it, it may not have the same effectAnd if you were one of said old boys, you'd already be in the club.How is it a scam? I can attend shareholder meetings and help guide the business. Doesn‚Äôt sound like a scam..... could you at least leverage free food or some small perks ?Tell me moreEven if that ‚Äúrandom shareholder‚Äù holds a fairly large amount of shares? Could you at least leverage it into a cushy job?1% is a fairly substantial amount. Most people hold only a few shares. You‚Äôre up there with institutional investors and family members no?Wouldn‚Äôt that amount let you be buddy buddy with the board?You clearly have 0 ability to guide anything, you have even less guiding a business who other people have invested in. This isn‚Äôt a game it‚Äôs real life people spend their lives working in relevant industries to get a crack at board positions. What is your ability to read financials? do you understand trends? Marketing? Research?  

You can‚Äôt be this stupid to neglect so many details?An invite to the annual meeting, providing you pay your own expenses. But yes, there might be food there.0.1% or $40,000 worth of shares isn't a "fairly large amount." Especially considering that small cap companies like the one you mention have significant amounts of their shares owned by venture capitalists who invested before the company went public and/or the original proprietors who got shares in the company they founded when it went public.

I mentioned Warren Buffett because it's your reputation and expertise that matter, not the number of shares. You could own 49% of a company's shares but if you're an idiot with a bad reputation the other shareholders and the management will do what they can to stop you from having any influence on the company's operations. Even if you owned 51% they'd probably still find a way to do it. On the other hand, if you're Warren Buffett, small companies would probably love to have you on the board no matter what. The only reason why he doesn't do this is because he has better things to do with his time.No, in a company that small I would doubt there are many small investors, I would guess in most cases a majority of the stock would be held by a group maintaining a majority to control who's on the board.I understand financials clearly. That‚Äôs why I choose low debt companies with fair P/Es, a nice dividend yield and a good price/book, debt to equity etcBut that‚Äôs what every shareholder gets or are you implying the larger shareholders get a formal invitation?Why not just make a fake website spouting your experience and then weaseling your way in?I looked it up on rocketfinancial. My current position isn‚Äôt that much but I already have more shares than some of the smaller institutional investorsThe top is in clearly. You literally said nothing with that other than regurgitate words you‚Äôve seen in other post.Shareholders with enough shares to possibly influence a board seat I would assume get some kind of VIP treatment.  I would be surprised if $40M market cap companies have board members that aren't either employees, significant owners, or have expertise (i.e. finance) that would be useful.Because that's fraud.It's not the number of investors, 100 investors with 1 share each have less say than 1 investor with a 101.  Small companies have smaller boards and you would need a percentage of stock roughly equal to the inverse of the board members to  push yourself onto the board. so probably ~10%.I hope it crashes so I can buy more into Nano caps.But what‚Äôs your cut off of ‚Äúpossible influence‚Äù?No. Just say you ‚Äúran your own
Business with 100% day over day growth in the food distribution business (opened a lemonade stand and sold one glass the first day and two the next). Or ‚ÄúI have experience in tech‚Äù (help desk it)

That way it‚Äôs technically not lying.That‚Äôs a shame. Are there any little perks with a larger than average amount of ownership?You are going to have a very rough time investing you seem like a bot at this point.The board you're looking to join is 5-7 people if that many. Depending on how much of the stock is voting at large, you'd need 7-8% to control maybe half a seat.They'd probably background check you, or at least ask around if anyone's ever heard of you. And even if you did somehow manage to con your way into a seat, you'd immediately start sticking for not knowing anything and for not contributing anything of value.A $40M market cap business is tiny. I work in a manufacturing plant of generic industrial hardware and we have 150ish employees and we're double that size.What about the vip treatment threshold?I know enough about business and economics to make dueThe one I have my eye on develops wiring harnesses and fiber optic cables etc. even pays a small dividend. Funny thing is revenue growth isn‚Äôt too bad and the revenue is higher than the market capNo one human being, especially one as openly slimy as yourself, can match the collective knowledge of an entire board of highly experienced individuals likely coming from entire families that have been dealing in business for generations. And here you are trying to twist arms for a shot at a snack bar.I really doubt that, if you have no idea whether or not a 0.1% or $40,000 investment in a $40,000,000 company is enough to get you a board seatHave you seen the boards for nano cap stocks? None of them are googleable they‚Äôre so obscureTo be fair it‚Äôs a rarely discussed topic. I‚Äôm just looking for special treatment and maybe a sweet gig if I‚Äôm luckyI may not know who is on their boards, but I can guarantee you they're not stupid enough to go to Reddit and ask if they can get free Doritos if they throw some pocket change at a company. Nobody is impressed by your wealth, and even fewer are impressed by you personally. No one would even consider giving you a say in next week's dinner, much less a company. Add to that that your plan is as small as just leeching off the organization for a salary and snacks? Get the fuck outta here, kid.Well, you can try. Go find a $40,000,000 company, buy $40,000 worth of stock, then call up the chairman and ask "hey, can you remove one of the Ivy League MBAs and industry veterans on the board and give me, a random nobody, his seat?" Presuming that you even manage to talk to the chairman, anyway.I‚Äôd be a decently sized shareholder nonetheless.Maybe in the 60s a 40 million dollar company had that but not now. I see some of the hqs in company‚Äôs that small. They‚Äôre not much more impressive than some small businesses. Maybe a building in an office park.Good for you. Now until you get some controlling portion of the company, that's all you'll ever be.Then it shouldn't be a problem for you to get a board seat, since apparently the best metric for a company's quality is its office space. Go try it, even if you have to fraudulently present your credentials by making a fake website.Just saying 40 million isn‚Äôt what it used to bePsychology, you think something is too high and will fall, then it goes higher proving you wrong now the old ATH looks like a ‚Äúdeal‚ÄùHardest game in the world is finding the bottom of a dip. Most of the time you‚Äôll miss it and it‚Äôll go down further. But buying at a 5% discount when later it drops to 10% only to rise again substantially beats full-price (if such a thing exists).

Rinsed and repeated over hundreds of trades with capital reinvested, cyclical and repetitive dip-buying can offer phenomenal returns compared to just buying something you like.

Trick is to always have 20 companies you know and like: that way you‚Äôll always find a dip once every few weeks.You shouldn't be looking at stock price only. Instead look at metrics such as P/E, P/B, PEG, quick ratio, earnings growth, debt, cash on hand, and others.To be honest it's about cash for me. I'd love to drop a bunch on a stock a like but I can't so I just add to my position  over time and I add on those dips when I get more cash.The margin / risk  desk can take just about any action in defense of the firm. They have millions of accounts, and your account is too small to affect price. 

You are apprised of typical brokerage action on underfunded accounts.



Just exit by noon eastern time on expiration day, or better, the day before.  

All brokerage firms will do this.

Also this has been known for years so its not new information and its pretty much priced into the current price of the stockBinodThe PS4 and Xbox 1 currently use them so it's not exactly new. They are fairly low margin as well. 

Real money is in datacenters which AMD is slowly cracking their way into more.Previous consoles used AMD hardware, the only significance to this is that AMD retains that revenue stream. Microsoft and Sony also funded RnD which benefits all parties involved. However, this shouldn‚Äôt have a huge impact on either companies stock value.Priced in broWe landed on the moonOk so they‚Äôre giving Intel some serious competition in general, which means it‚Äôs a pretty good investmentYesThe election is the sole reason.  Trump always does better in chaos, so he is creating the chaos he needs.To be honest I don't get how China banned Google, Facebook, Telegram, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. But the USA wants to ban one company and they loose their minds.Your really don‚Äôt know? To change news coverage. Coronavirus and unemployment talk doesn‚Äôt really go well for the administration, does it?if the political benefit of poking china in the eye outweighs the political cost of stocks going down then the trump man will poke awayBecause they're the ones responsible for the pandemic and subsequent economic effects?China actually started the Cold War first...... and not with just America. 

I won't go into details much since this is not r/politics, but look up what they've done so far, especially in that region, after they recovered but other countries are still suffering from coronavirus.Because there needs to be an excuse to shift sectorsBut isn‚Äôt Trump all about stock market? He‚Äôs throwing ton of money to keep it moving...Agreed 100%, and not sure if China has really recovered, they just don‚Äôt report the truth but my point is why banning and executive orders now! I should probably take this topic to r/politics.Trump is all about Trump re-election.he still has time to distract from covid, then fix the chaos he caused in time for markets to go up before electionRussia wants to swing the election to Trump. China wants to swing to Biden. (That‚Äôs all over the news today). So ... who would Trump like to hurt?Honestly, I don't know what was in Trump's mind. He might do this just to make his supporters happy (like other moves in the past few months). What I was saying is that regardless of that, this move is still legit given the current political climate. Other president might have done the same.Are you saying you sold 2 AAPL 470 puts and bought 1 of the 465, 455 and 445 puts (for a net of short 2 puts and long 3 puts)?

If that's the case all of them expired in the money today as AAPL closed at 444.45 so you will be assigned on your shorts and your longs should be auto exercised.  If this is the case you will be short 100 shares.

You could have sold out just the one 445 puts and come in flat, or you could have notified your clearing firm not to exercise your long 445 put and would have come in flat (too late now).

There is also a very small chance that your clearing firm filed a "do not exercise" form for your 1 445 put to reduce their risk.u/theta_007/u/papacharlie9 /u/cclagator /u/vegastoleyourtendies /u/TappyDev /u/arosati1215It may be that the credit I received from the position originally will cover the difference, but it‚Äôs hard to tell that from how my account assets are representedYes, that‚Äôs correct.  I was modifying a previous existing position, ...I thought my downside was limited to less than 200 from my options chart ‚Äúanalysis‚Äù in Power E*TRADE .  I screwed up that interpretation>(I did this yesterday to hedge my longer position of a calendar

Wait, you're long something? What is it?

So you're actually making bank then?I thought I could lose only 200 or so.  All day I was down on the trade, but held onto it, because it was a directional gain with a move of 15 points in either direction.  for better or worse, AAPL held steady all day with only a 2% decline.  My hedge position looks like it cost me $2000 for trying to save 200-300 dollars.  Damn.  That's rough.  Back to real estate for me I suppose.  I love the market, and options, but damn if its not with the money/hr return....No, not exactly unfortunately, but I like your positive spin!! I have a 445 calendar spread, short leg expiring next Friday , long leg expiring the following Friday .  It‚Äôs small, bc my account is small for now, so max profit of just $600 or so on the calendar.   I‚Äôm up on it by 120 ish now.Do you suspect that sales will increase as small/medium business stop accepting cash due to covid? Do they compete directly with Sq?I got 240 shares at an average of 26. Started lst year with 140 and bought 100 more during covidOne thing I couldn't understand is why they employ so many people?Bought ~150 shares (split bet taxable & roth) during Covid. I do not aim to sell for a long time given the new normalUnfortunately this is what you signed up for when you decided to do a covered call. You are getting a credit upfront in exchange for sacrificing any profit on your stock beyond the strike price of the call you sold.

You could roll your short call out in time but that would bring only around $0.30 and you would need to do the same thing for next month if your stock stays around that level. 

Also, rolling the short call up and out would be for a debit which is not very smart position management. 

I would say let your shares go (do nothing, they will be called away from you at expiration) and chalk it up to inexperience and now you really know what you are giving up when you do a covered call.Nothing you can do. You put yourself in a CC hole.The profits above that strike are not yours, they are for whoever bought the call. Would just do nothing and let your shares go. You can buy more shares if you like.If it has run past your strike price a lot there usually isnt much you can do but wait and hope. Sometimes you can roll it up and out one strike for a small credit but I dont think you will get that opportunity because of the low stock price and wide strikes.  I would never roll for a debit.

Option prices are juicy.  You could enter an order to roll your current contract to September for a 40 or 50 cent credit.  That might get filled on a pullback and would offer a nice 30+% annualized return.Na man. You need the down timeThis is too much. If ever was a sign of euphoria...What‚Äôs the point? Even if it was open 24/7 there will still be set times where volume is the highest. Futures are available 23/5. And there‚Äôs pitiful volume during times US/Europe/Asia is not open. Especially USSure why notGet market on some methamphetamine and it will run 24/7I doubt itUh, ever heard of futures?I agree just wanted to hear people‚Äôs takes24/7 implies the market being open all day, 7 days a week. Futures are closed at 5pm on Friday, all day Saturday, and reopen at 6pm Sunday, so it's not really 24/7. Also, futures close for a 15 minute period at 4:15pm and a 30min period at 5:30, so futures don't answer OP's question either.Futures close, and they are not normal stock transactionshttps://youtu.be/cu1FXt4JEs8 , check that out it should help put some prospective on options yo.Thanks yo. It is pretty much what I do. Of course, high VIX is relative now considering where it has been this year.Don‚Äôt you think Warren planned out how Berkshire will move on when he passes? I think they got it figured outI'm not sure, the "younglings" seem very very good at Brk (you can look into their trades for the past 5 years, they've been carrying the investment fund even more than Buffett/Munger). They know more about tech, they have a better vision of modern value and trends. The man is a legend and is still a much better investor than me, but he also put extremly competent people in place to replace him and maybe even do better.

 The day of the event maybe it will go swinging a bit, but the future of Brk is looking good.Some ill-informed speculators will probably over react to his death, but the underlying value of what BRK owns will not materially change in value.You mean *if* he dies.Just look at Apple and that should ease your concerns.It may initially sell-off when people overreact, but Warren and Charlie have a succession plan in place and people who have learned under them for many years. Berkshire will be fine.I would rather see this as a big chance for Berkshire. The ‚Äûsecond row‚Äú seems to be quite good - to invest into Apple was the idea of one of Berkshires managersIt'll probably go upIf it were a death without any warning (God forbid), then that may shock some investors-but like others have said, everyone has kind of seen this situation coming...

And if there is a long term hospitalization before he passes, this would give the scaredy investors more time to logically react - as opposed to an irrational sudden panic by the less informed shareholders.Personally I feel BRK will become more aggressive with their cash pile once he is gone, which I like. There will be a dip and I will buy itIf might pullback, but I doubt it crashes, it‚Äôs a free cash flow machine and will be way after Warren and Charlie are goneHe‚Äôs too conservative. It‚Äôll go up. The successors have been managing big portions of BRK for years already this will just give them free reign to utilize the massive cash horde.buffet is illuminati he wont die unless he agrees to itI feel BRK will do even better after Buffet. For eg. in 2019, BRK bought $1B worth of Amazon shares (among their best investment). That wasn't Buffet, but one of their investment managers.That doesn‚Äôt change the fact that any negative news can result in short term negative price movements. Sure, the value of the companies are the same, but if one of the most well known investors dies his fund is likely to take a hit before it recovers, especially if it‚Äôs sudden.This. I‚Äôll be investing a good lump-sum in this event.This right here

BUY. THE. DIP.What happened to Apple when Job‚Äôs passed away? I wasn‚Äôt investing at the time, so I honestly don‚Äôt know. That‚Äôs the first comparison I can think of though.Have to? No. Should? Absolutely! Take your profit ASAP, your probability of loss is not 0%.

You may not be getting a fill if one of the legs has a 0 bid. If that is the case, and you are deep enough ITM it's probably okay to just let both legs expire worthless. You can alternatively close the short, if you can do so for a decent price, and just let the long expire worthless. That gives you some protection against a surprise last minute move.You are risking an after-hours move which potentially could lead to assignment.

How risky it is depends on how far your short leg is from the current price. Since you don't mention that it's hard to quantify it

I would say the only way to eliminate all risk would be to close your spread and not let it get to expiration even if you pay a dime or so for that.Though the spread is currently worthless, RH does not allow for me to "pay" $0 to close the spread, so I am attempting to do so for a $1 debit. Am I right to do this ?try a nickel or a dimeYea, that's what I would recommend, try closing for a penny.  Hopefully you get a bite - otherwise you just need to wait til close :(  On the flip side, though, there is a very small chance that it moves after close but before it clears, and you may get a tiny bit more than you expected, so you can hope for that :-D  The other day, I had no choice but to let two losing spreads and one winning spread expire, and the end result was that somehow I gained an extra $85 dollars I should not have gained, I think because between the move and the two assignments, I ended up a teeny bit more profitable than expected.At what strike price?$31Good news, then. It's already up to like $0.48 a share if you want some quick cash.They went down to 23¬¢ -61.02% on Friday. The $32 are 48¬¢.Sitting this one out.  I already banked on my long aapl position and they are way overvalued.   My long gold and slv positions are good even if it pulls back another 3-10 percent.  There will be a stimulus package and the market cannot price in what the impact will be without stimulus.  China issue is just cover to take profits.See you in Wall Street Bets in Sept!that‚Äôs pushing my comfort zone personally but who knows they just hit their all time high and we‚Äôre in the midst of a huge tech bubble. tech leads our marketI too want to get in on the aapl action but that‚Äôs too high a premium right now. I need another down day to drive down the option prices more before I‚Äôll consider. 

Ultimately, however, when Apple was down at the end of July, if you would have bought a 10/16 400c for 10.49 on 7/24, it would still be worth 53.5 today. 

High risk, high rewardBruv why would you be retarded?i feel like 2trln market cap hype will push it more.*imo*Well their stock split is happening at the end of this month. That could either trigger some massive gainsHow about 9/4 debit spread $450/$465? Nip me in the ass from max profit but guarantee prints.Once another stimulus gets passed, slv will start it's climb up to 50$13% in less than a month just to hit the strike price... üò¨That‚Äôs the bet.... little thing called an election.  I bought more calls in my positions... thank you Tim appleARKK recently sold some of its Tesla: it‚Äôs  now ~9% vs ~10% before. They readjusted the weights this week, which is why I love ARK; they are actively managed, they are aware of our concerns, and they address it sooner rather than later.Take a look at L&G Global Tech Fund.I just picked up 75 shares today. Going the long run.Why does no one talk about arkf? That personally my favorite.TSLA is only 9% of ARKK, that's not "heavy weighted".

ARKK is also a managed ETF, allocation will change over time according to circumstances.

If your risk tolerance is low then QQQ is the way to go imho.All
Growth stocks have had surges. Safer? HuhYour concern was that it was at 10% instead of 9%?Lmao you got downvoted but this is great advice..My concern that arkk was too heavy in Tesla and they‚Äôre reducing it. You think they‚Äôre just going to remove it all at once?ARKK will never hold more than 9% of a given equity, they have to trim TSLA every time it pumps otherwise it would have taken over a large portion of their portfolio. ARKK is [bullish as fuck](https://ark-invest.com/analyst-research/tesla-price-target/) on TSLA theyre never going to not have it as their majority holding.https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/options-strategies-covered-calls-covered-putsSelling calls and puts at the same strike is called a straddle. Selling at different strikes is called a strangle.  Both trades are common.

It's a strategy betting that vol is too high.I guess it depends.  Do I want to own the stock?  Do I mind owning the stock?

For me, I personally do NOT want to own NIO.  However, I would trade it using spreads.You need to learn about implied volatility.  The ‚Äúpayout‚Äù you are measuring is a product of IV. The more volatility the higher the premium.PRPL is really good right now.

Earnings are in a week, but it is a real company with real growth and a real product and real potential unlike NKLA, and not some sketchy Chinese shit like NIO. As long as you are willing to baghold and turn it into a long term trade if needed, Short PRPL puts are really, really great right now.Sorry it was early in the morning. Typing error!I know about selling them, I am just curious on what others are selling puts and calls.I like NIO don‚Äôt mind owning it. I feel like the premium it pays is a lot better than any other stock within its price range.Yes I know about implied volatility, it has earnings this coming week so premium is spiked for the implied move it might have. Even when it sold down to $11 and some change from $16 it stayed around that price for a bit. It eventually traded up to $13. I bought a good amount of shares at a low price.Sounds like you‚Äôre a little confused using ‚Äúcovered put‚Äù languageThat's not necessarily a good thing.The higher IV/premium means the stock is expected to and has moved lot. So, don‚Äôt be surprised if you get throat chopped.The day after the heat death of the universe. That's a Tuesday Like never , unless you are desperate for cash. Apple, MS, FB , CRM, Amazon and few others of the same category should be long long term investment.When your kids inherit it at the step-up cost basis and sell with little cap gainsLook at there financials...their revenue can decrease and they will still have a net profit of billions. I would say probably never. With your investing if you had 10million dollars you could figure out a way to produce the income you want and maintain the principal. They literally have make billions every year and have investments making money. If they can continue the trend then why would anyone sell that asset.Go to it‚Äôs ALL on your chart graphyvthingy...has it been steadily going to the right and up... there‚Äôs your answer.You could set yourself a goal and then sell some of the stocks if it reaches this price.

Then wait for a drop and restock.When some new company with the next revolutionary item comes along with greater upside and money flies in that direction instead.


People here thinking that Apple and the other FAANGs should never be sold are falling to the same delusions that generations past did. Ask someone in the 1920s if they thought GM would ever fall from grace, or someone from the 70s about IBM. These companies are still with us, but no one under 40 is putting any money in them, and with good reason. At some point the upside just runs out.When everybody thinks it‚Äôs a BUY.iPhone 12 is coming get hyped!I was predicting their demise . Saying Tim Cook is their Steve Ballmer. But with the SE iPhone at $400+ not anymore. The SE might mean less people buying ridiculously expensive phones or maybe notNow. 
Apple has had great returns, but it's price has gone insane. It'll eventually price correct in a major way, and you'll wish you had sold.Not in the near future.What company has more potential to grow that you are thinking of getting into? (Genuinely interested) 

I‚Äôve held Apple since 2010 and it‚Äôs by far my best return even through over priced times and when it flat lines.STOP NO ONE KNOWSI recently trimmed my Apple and plowed it into Facebook. Higher revenue growth + better valuation (unbelievable!) than AAPL. I still hold AAPL, but it was getting too outsized in comparison to my other holdings, lol. I hold all of FAANG (except for Netflix) + MSFT. 

Another higher growth play I like that is not FAANG related is Match.com (MTCH), which is a king in its category. Pinterest (PINS) has the potential to soar because it is a unique social media stock and social media stocks are scarce and enjoy the powerful network flywheel effect.If they go private and you are forced to sell...You don‚Äôt sell Apple or Microsoft.Whenever you need cash. It's almost like a bank account, and they just might have more cash reserves than most banks.A year from now when Apple breaks past $1000 mark you‚Äôll be like ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt I buy more back in august 2020‚Äù. Who said it need to stop? It really doesn‚Äôt.Playing devil's advocate. Every time you buy, there's a seller.

At this prices. With this PER. With the crisis... I mean.

Imagine you bought years ago being a young fella, and you can pay a house with your profits. Sell Apple and be sure sooner or later it's gonna have a correctionSo how much higher do you think it can go if we don‚Äôt consider the split?Microsoft. It is widely used in education. I‚Äôm a teacher in a huge district and we use Microsoft over Google Classroom. The entire education suite is constantly expanding.

Microsoft has features that Google Classroom lacks when it comes to distance learning. And there is definitely room for growth there. They are making changes based on feedback from teachers, and these changes will put Microsoft on a whole new level as far as digital education goes.**I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**

It‚Äôs a huge factor imo.Low 700s. Unlike other stocks you won‚Äôt see Apple go above 1k. They usually then split before that. Plus the advantage Apple has it that is has an unmovable customer base. It‚Äôs a culture for Apple product users. If you create among your consumer base it‚Äôs very hard  to see a stock and company like that falter.STOP WITH
THE STUPID FORECAST BSShoot ain‚Äôt nothing wrong with MSFT that‚Äôs blue chip to blue chip. MSFT and AAPL are my two biggest holdings and have just been stellar.I agree, but I feel like Apple has run its course for the time being. However, I am aware that I probably won‚Äôt ever get back in at the price I did when I entered Apple.Post your reasons. Get others opinions. That‚Äôs how this works.If someone is asking, it's a dumb move.

The call has approximately 20 percent chance of making money if held until expiration. That far out, liquidity is mediocre to poor, so the transaction friction is high.Probably the smartest thing I‚Äôve ever seenMSFT is bullish long term but you are talking about adding 1/4th more market cap in a year.  

That is a lot.Debit spread $220/$240 Nov 20 for me. Limit my gain, but looks like a better move overallLmao ya my bad Idk I don‚Äôt really have like a solid reason I just believe it‚Äôs an extremely undervalued stock and with the company‚Äôs they already own and are looking into idk how long term it could possibly go down I feel like it‚Äôs a far more safe bet the. Like apple where I believe due to lack of innovation they will eventually fall flatYa good point might look into a less bullish play maybe like 270ishLoled at your last sentence>I just believe it‚Äôs an extremely undervalued stock

You realize their market cap is 1.61T, right? That's the number you need to look at to calculate the value of a stock, not the share price.That last sentence, yikes man. Also I‚Äôd like to hear why Microsoft is undervalued. What should the share price be at and how did you arrive at that valuation?I'd settle around 240-250 myself.  

If this market turns sideways we might see a cycling out of tech and into other equities.OP sounds cluelessDCF models are useful for understanding what you would need to assume to justify current valuations; e.g., do you need to assume near 30% revenue growth for the next five years? Fundamentals and ratios are extremely flawed at evaluating growth companies like Tesla, but are good for quick and dirty evaluations of large established companies like Bank of America. Companies are always evaluated on where they will go, not what they look like in a given year, so take fundamental ratios with a grain of salt. Exxon looks great on a PE ratio, but if it‚Äôs revenues decrease 5% every year to perpetuity as people shift to clean energy, its a terrible buy.Depends on the multiples you're using to value the company. Also don't use Gordon growth model for DCF ( use exit multiples).Independently of which models you should understand the business you will put your money. Understand how the company makes money to check for the Ratios that matter in that sector you are analysing!I would strongly disagree; so really want to know why? What‚Äôs the argument against the terminal growth approach?

For me using a multiple terminal value seems contradictory to valuation. It means you are now engaged in pricing rather than valuation. There‚Äôs no way you can make a call on how the market might be pricing a company 5, 10, 15 years out. But the story you weave about a business can totally arrive at a terminal growth rate (ie ‚ÄúI expect this business to grow rapidly for the next 5years, then growth decelerates for 5 years until it it is growing at a terminal rate in line with mature businesses in this industry‚Äù)I take your side on this I use constant growth model in my terminal values but I know 3 very good managers who managed money for a firm I used to work for all very successful and they use terminal multiples as a % of S&P. If done properly both can work and you can screw them both up.‚Äú...you can screw them both up.‚Äù

Ain‚Äôt that the truth lol üòÜEveryone has rushed to tech because that‚Äôs what‚Äôs currently safe. Once everything else becomes safe again, many will leave tech and look for a bargain elsewhere.I wouldn‚Äôt want to be holding onto tech when eventually a vaccine arrives which means blue chip stocks currently at half price and a lot of other beaten down stocks will rally in part due to many selling ATH tech stocks and buying recovering stocks...I understand this logic, but while Covid was shutting down production sectors, artificial intelligence, IOT, and 5G consortiums were prioritized and are not going away.Consumer behaviors have changed due to this, they will come back to some degree.The world has change the enterprise levels running in cloud isn‚Äôt coming down. Both sample and Activision are consumer goods not tech. 

The stocks that haven‚Äôt done well beyond travel and leisure have shown their fragility in business model and or fundamentals. QQQ will keep our performing because it encompasses companies with a higher rate of innovation. Innovation = growth.TD Ameritrade's thinorswim is amazing for active trading. You should know that pattern day trading rules will prevent you from making more than three day trades in a five day period. Swing trading is probably your best bet. Have fun!Never put more than $20 of your $100 on a single position. When you get it to $200, never more then $20. 

Never more than 10% of your investment capital on one position with one underlying. (Might need 20% if starting with a hundo ; )


Actually nothing wrong with RH, TOS, or Fidelity‚Äôs platform. If you get serious about options, TastyWorks is your friend.

If you become any good at this, open a Roth IRA and put your money in there and then trade options therein for extremely low tax exposure.

Nothing wrong on learning on RH with a small amount: what‚Äôs important is that you see and learn how the pieces move.I day traded today for the frst timne for fun. I bought $13K of Tesla and made a $200 profit. Can't see myself do this long term though lolTo test strategy or to learn , use simulated accounts. Learn about pro and cons of each platform before u do it for real.

I think ib lite has low comms if u need the requirementDon‚Äôt think you can open an account for $100 on those.With $100 he will be opening a cash account. There is no pattern day trading rule on cash accounts he can trade as many times as he likes10 percent is a good guide although I wouldn't call it a rule or never do.  There are times where you would put in more.You can actually fully use thinkorswim with no brokerage account by using their papermoney account. Also, there is [no account minimum](https://www.tdameritrade.com/account-types/faqs-opening.page), however a $2,000 minimum is required for more advanced features (margin, options, etc).Yeah: just trying to tell him that which every yolo/newbie should have been told to allow them to keep whatever they scored in an up-tick.

No absolute rules in anything‚Äîyou‚Äôre right. If Any ITM GOOGL, AMZN, AAPL, or FB LEAPS or long-expiry calls were suddenly discounted 60% or more for nearly any reason, I‚Äôd have no issue putting 3/4 of my capital therein (then buy yet another beach property a few mos down the road üèñ).I just looked at is as a buying opportunity, and loaded up on some CRWD.Entire cloud sector took a beating. The more overvalued a company was, the higher the dip it saw today. ayx/ ddog/fsly led the pack, with the rest tagging along as collateral.Must be because of the overall results from that space including Fortinet and such.The relative values of spin-off and parent are reflected in the prices of each...*USUALLY* totalling the price before the action.Right, so If I owned $10k in ECL before the spin-off, and if we say CHX was, for example, 10% of the value of the entire ECL enterprise, I should have $9k in ECL and $1k in CHX after the spin-off, correct?

I think that's true in theory but I'm interested in what **actually** happened. Did ECL shareholders receive any CHX shares after the spin-off? I know they were given the option to exchange $100 of ECL stock for $111.11 of CHX stock but that's not really what I'm looking for, since you might also want to hold your ECL but value was taken from you without remunerationI‚Äôm holding it, seems just to be a small dip tbhyes investors are terrified the stock has dropped to lows not seen since 2 days agoTry wallmine as a stock screener, there's plenty others too but wallmine works for me.

Read news and learn about a company

Read Reddit, with a pinch of salt, I have a multi of: stocks, investing, ukinvesting, spacs, undervalued etc. which can be good but like anything finding the useful content amongst the noise is tricky

Read stocktwits, with a  pinch of salt, 98% noise but you can find useful data here to inspect and judge for yourself

All free and open tools to consume data with but it mostly depends on seeing what others are sharing and deciding on whether you can see value in what they are peddling.

Just my approach but it fits quite well for working a full time job as you can just consume what you deem valuable information and then investigate and make the investment decision yourself you feel comfortable with.Apple = safe move. 
Finviz for search. 
Reddit and podcasts for inspiration what to look into.Secret to successful trading: Buy whichever company CEO is on CNBC right now. Sell when he‚Äôs done speaking.Marketwatch.comEasiest is iphone Yahoo SPY for major company news.It's actually kind of funny that wallmine has a "robinhood popularity" table. According to most people it seems as if robinhood is not a very good brokerage and I'm currently with them, not sure if it's possible to transfer the shares I hold with them to a new brokerage but dont know a better one to choose anyways.I'd have to watch that a bit before I try that.Haha yeah I noticed that first time, maybe a good indicator for retail investor activity, I don't really pay attention to it now. I like wallmine as it's a really nice format for phones and all the stat, earnings, institutional, insider info etc. is just in one convenient scroll pane.I think its a great company. I dont have it yet becuase  I dont like Chinese stocks. They do have a lot of great investments in Tesla, nio, streaming services and game companies. Wechat is strong too and wont go anywhere in China. I think they have a pretty good future ahead of them.im buying, this fud will blow over and itll moon. China gonna pump tencent even more if america messes with it. Making it 1T will become a matter of national pride. Its OTC so cant be delisted anyway.I don't like Chinese stocks either. Something about owning a part of a company that is owned in part by the Chinese government makes me uneasy.You see it going a bit lower first, maybe low 60s?SWPPX is a low cost mutual fund that follows the S&P 500.

Long term holdYou‚Äôd need a time machine to know that. Mine‚Äôs broken.NklaMSFT, LRCX, ASML, MU, AAPL, QCOM. Each of these have unique edges that will be needed with tech advancements.  T, KO, RTX, ABBV, DUK for consistency, not bad volatility, good dividends that typically increase per year.A lot of these EV startups are aiming for a 2022-2025 SOP. I think buying their stocks when they go public and sitting on them until they have cars on the road is a good move. Also  any material stocks for aluminum will probably show a lot of growth. Most BEV battery enclosures are made of full aluminum and when more are on the road the demand for aluminum will go way up.SPY/VOO

Set and forgetNot exactly the answer to your question, but there's a channel called DONGXii - The China opportunity. He talks almost exclusively about stocks in the Chinese market, but most of them trade on the NYSE. I found him because he does NIO videos, and his knowledge, delivery, and production is all exceptional. A very niche sector but he's the best stock/ business YouTuber I've come across.Chevron, exxonYesTaketwo > blizzard? Wonder how yall feel about thisWhat's unique about Lemonade?They may revolutionize the insurance business and I hope that they do, but that doesn't mean that they will be successful in the long-term. I looked into buying Lemonade after its IPO, but I decided against it because I don't see any moat for this company.

Any large insurance company or even one of the Big Tech companies could easily and likely eventually will duplicate what they are doing if they see that it is proving to be successful. And once they do, the name recognition of these huge companies and their ability to be able to afford to throw money at the problem to price match/beat any rate that Lemonade would be able to offer will be too much competition for Lemonade to survive against in my opinion.

I would not trust Lemonade as a long-term hold until I can see a moat for their business model. Right now, I don't see any.Nothing. It's just a blend of water, sugar, & lemon juice.Lemonade has a very unique app that allows customers to file claims and get their payments immediately.Insurance is just historically such a slow clunky business with huge margins and tons of middlemen. Lemonade uses AI not only to reduce the middlemen and reduce premiums to start, but also has that ‚ÄúBenjamin button‚Äù effect where the more people use it, the better the AI knows the customer(s) and therefore brings premium downs even more. All the big insurance  boys are too slow and dumb to catch them once they get going, IMO.It may be unique right now, but the problem that I see is that it is something that could easily be duplicated. How does Lemonade compete after their app and model is inevitably duplicated by a much bigger company?100% agree. This is insurance for MillennialsI really like this company too. But I find their lose so easy to reproduce. I cannot see one of the big player just copy that or even at some point just buy them which would be the best scenario.Every earnings now is a speculative play in which swing traders got in two weeks ago anticipating good reports and then sell off for profitsCWH has done the same thing.Yeah. I‚Äôve been getting crushed on CWH. You think it‚Äôll bounce back?I sure hope so. 

I was lucky enough to be able to average down quite a bit, but you never know if you are catching the falling knife, or being smart by averaging down. 

Hoping Monday sorts some of that out.The "low battery" notification at the end was the pi√®ce de r√©sistance."I'm not in profit even tho im back up to 89K.

If not, RIP.I‚Äôm afraid you will hear a lot of what if‚Äôs but most of all I hope for you to find your best way to go through the experience, I feel the biggest is to accept it as a life lesson learned - take from the experience to apply to your life going forward and when you can focus your energy as much as often as possible on the things you are thankful for in your life.I mean.. there I times I feel I fucked up. then I see stuff like this and Im like naaaa I am okBruh you brought the receipts and they are hilarious.

Is everybody on this sub really that retarded? Bc I am! Lost 20K. I‚Äôm now at $52 and some change. What is wrong with us?!I‚Äôve been saving for 3 years and have 60K. Once I get to 120K I plan on liquidating to buy a house. Your loss saddens me because I could‚Äôve bought house now with your money...Dat free stonk thoThis is the way:PEPEHANDS:June 10th or 11th looks like a withdrawal.I will fap to this for years to cumFThis turned me onLost so much money they couldn't pay the electric billHonestly, i love these posts so much. Makes me feel better about my 900$ loss lmaoYour phone said, "Aight enough get lost now"next time you have 100k give it to me I'll kick you in the nuts and give you back 20k in 2 months.

you'll feel better and get a better returnBroGive some of you credit for being on here and jokey for shitting away money for no apparent reason other than needing to be a millionaire in 3 months.You've reached a new level of self sabotage.niceToo much is never enoughthis is pain I too have feltI wish I could that muchWhat was the worst mistake you did?It's nice to know who's money I'm actually taking in the market.

Thank you for the contribution to my wallet.Get a red Bull for 2.99 and buy a cigg off someone with the rest, I don't see anything else worthwhile except that. RipAnother magnificent witless wonderBeen there, lost my entire savings (about half of yours) before realizing I wasn't good at this and quitting and turning to shares. Made quite a bit back since. As long as you're young-ish you'll be fine. But be careful of the addition, reading about your casino losses too makes me think its dangerous.100 grand and investing on Robinhood. Jesus.Tf were you doing for all that time, buddy just let his entire portfolio go to shitGot me wondering when the fuck to sell it all if it had been me..... how the fk did u even lose when u could win by doing call options on pretty much anything in march to now? You couldve just DCA-ed into your positions instead as well and still wudve made 50% return for many stocks.What the fuck you literally are retardedWTF manall options and no stonks? RIPHow much do you have in your savings nowwhats it like to flush 100k down the drain?Bruh u still got over 3 dollars if you cashout now you could buy like 10 chicken McNuggets$100k is nothing when you have $100k in Robinhood account
-Abraham LincolnI am proud of uSuch disappointment lulz come downI invested $300 and came down to $256 and I felt horrible. I can‚Äôt imagine how it must feel to get completely screwed like this, RIPWhat the fuckthat‚Äôs how you do it..Those last two peaks seem like the middle finger saying "Fuck you". üòìNo tendies boiFhonest question how does this happen?

Like how many shares made the pot 106K? So if it was say 100 shares at $1060 a share.

So to end up in the end with $3.40, each share fell to 3.4 cents?

The share price fell from $1060 to $0.034?

How is this possible? Do stocks do this? Perform that badly?Thanks for sharing OPWhy was June 8th so bad? My chart is similar. I had record highs and then June 8th. I had to started googling what Margin Balance meant.You lost a shit ton of money but at least you hit hot in r/wallstreetbetsMy dumb shit played with options after losing $25k in the initial crash. I was a gay bear buying puts in June and lost $30k more. I told myself never again in July and made some money back buying stocks. Went from $550k -> $525k -> $490k~ -> $500k. I‚Äôm still very scared so I‚Äôm only playing with $200k and $300k in cash l. My BRK.B is up 15% since I bought it. Should‚Äôve just dumped all my money in and call it a day.Bro this might be the best loss porn I've seen. 100% loss. $3.40 left. That is incredible.

And I was feeling like shit earlier this week losing some tiny ER plays.Probably shouldn't use 99% buying power. Either way I commend you for üíé ‚úã that.Dude if you wanna do this but faster and less painful just hit me up I'll take your money instead atleast then you might get it back if you ask for it.These charts legit make me sad üò¢I'm sorry man. That shit hurts to watchAs a non retard, I kept most money in equity, only a.bitnin calls, so no. But I did go from being down 50% to being up 100%.Honestly, thank you OP. I know it sucks to lose your life savings but if there‚Äôs a silver lining, just know posts like this save ppl like me. I have about 90k in boring index funds and I‚Äôve been tempted so many times to throw it into the stock market for some YOLOs. Seeing this stops me. I‚Äôm sorry for you, but at least you can say you talked at least one knucklehead off the ledge. Cheers mate!You lost all that, in a 50% rally were literally even bankrupt companies were rallying ü§ïLiterally if you bought slv leaps you would be a millionaire but you‚Äôre a geniusYou could have bought nothing but apple, fb, Google and Amazon in at the end of March and doubled your money.Even Nancy Pelosi wouldn‚Äôt touch WFC options if she was passing legislationoh my godFFist off..."Again"?!?!  
I'm down $112.42 and I am am kicking myself.Low Battery makes it so much more depressing.I don't understand why you wouldn't just thetagang. That's one of the biggest barrier of entry to it: the fact that if you wanna make more that 5 dollars a week using thetagang, you're gonna need a decent amount of capital. But with over 100k I'd stop trading options and just thetagang for the rest of forever.Seen enough of these to know that whenever I'm up 10%, or down 10%, take a break and reflect.How tf do you manage to lose 100k? I would literally take out 99k and just start back again with 1k. I would kill to get 100k.I can tell by that chart that you went diamond hands on a position that you definitely should not have time diamond hands on.

...serious fucking question.Why do people on this thread offer any support to this clown. Clearly just pissing away family money they didn‚Äôt earn.

I take it this isn‚Äôt common stock holding / trading? it‚Äôs playing the market and  betting on gains or falls in prices? 

Part way through the book ‚ÄòThe Intelligent Investor‚Äô and as far as I can tell so far it‚Äôs about holding common stocks for periods of time (and bonds).I trade small time and losing $200 made me feel shitty, watching this loss porn of someone‚Äôs life savings is cathartic af I gotta tell you. Thank you for postingRed line go weeeeeeeeeeWell shid im here watching tiktok option spreadsFAfter the initial bullish fake-out at $100k, then bearish trend to $36k, followed with the ascending expanding wedge topping at $89k, the final target was obviously $3.60...You didn‚Äôt even try..The million dollar question is what was in your portfolio?Good thing most skyscrapers are closed during the pandemic otherwise this would be a tragedy... unless...hope you're good man. money aint everything. stay coolBorrow some money from your wife's boyfriendThat is nearly 10 years of rent + groceries for me that you lost, absolutely insane.YOLO bitch!

Did your companies got hit super hard, didn't have a chance to recover and went bankrupt?I don‚Äôt know if anyone has ever suggested this before but I have a crazy thought: I‚Äôm gonna try buying 1 contract at a time, setting stop losses or prices where I would exit the position if it looks like it isn‚Äôt going my way, and have a clear exit point (dollar amount or percentage gain) that when I get to that point I exit the position. Is that crazy?Deposit $500 from your credit card and turn it into $100k in a year or two. EZThe low battery completes the struggle.

But I made $17k a week ago, so the pain isn't that bad.I don't know anything about stocks.

Is there no way to predict when this happens? Like from news or something.
Also does it mean you lost 100 thousand dollars that you invested, or just what the stock was worth?Damn and I‚Äôm sitting here feeling bad for losing a few grand.He said lost it all again and here I am wishing I even had $100kGoddamn that‚Äôs not even autism, your mom must‚Äôve been on a 9 month long bender before you were born.Your not good at this gamelets not mention the all time chartOh God no no no no no noooooooo!!!!!!!!!I knew that last drop was June 11you've had a long summer, and it aint over yetOkay retards, someone I follow on IG posted this Medium article a couple months back and I‚Äôm KICKING myself for not following his logic: [https://link.medium.com/TyW6Rz0B46](https://link.medium.com/TyW6Rz0B46)

i'm from 90k to 10k.

there' no success without failure.These can't be real can they?   106k?  How do you get that much to begin with if you're a YOLOer.Stop thinking youre a trader and go paper trade first to practice. Jesus manJust FYI this guy had done nothing but post about losses for months. Seems suspect to me.You didn't deserve that money to lost it all like that. Give me 100 k, I will make 15% a year and live properly by the 15k gains.Don't even have money for a phone charger now. DamnLiterally everything is up , how did this happen???I'm like, mad at you.**Charge your phone and get back out there, champ.**Who trades with $100k on robinhoodDid you know something about option before all this? I hope you learnt something. I went down 10k and probably would have lost 100k if I had them.This makes me happy.You have officially been named a martyr. Your life‚Äôs work has showed us the light. Like if he should be worshiped.Were you using technicals... fundamentals? Were you anticipating any WFC catalyst news... job numbers, stimulus? What were you betting with?Robinhood is going to be hit with a massive class action eventually for letting people do this. For every person that posts here, there are probably several more who had the same gambling losses.Imagine being youEvery trade should teach you a lesson.With a small loan of $106,000 I lost it all. Sounds mildly familiarfakeWhich app is that?See this makes no sense to me. If you have 100K to start with, why won't you just play theta? I don't have the capital, but people like you who do, wake up every Monday morning, sell relatively otm put expiring the same Friday in one of the blue chip stocks  and depending on the stock, you'll get a consistent paycheck of 500-1000 bucks every week. If u get assigned, sell calls. You'll probably net about 26k-52K/year in profits (x52 weeks). Return of 26%-50% per year. Now next year, your Theta balls grew increasing your collateral to 126k-152K, this compounds year after year, and in 5-10 year with low risk long term Options on the side as well, you'll grow your account close to a Million. At this point, if you succeeded, even after paying taxes on gains, you developed a strategy, that'll put you in a position to make 6 figures every year and quit 9-5, but Nah, let's YOLO 100K in meme stocks and lets lose the whole 100k in 6 months.Seems like a pretty shitty 4 months. it‚Äôs just numbers on a screenüåàüêªbought puts?Do it again bitchCould have been pulling in an easy $1-2k a month being a part of theta gang... But I guess this was fun for you?You could've put all that cash into SPY Calls and would've had a high chance of not losing everythingHow all you have to do is scalp options or just swing shares.wsb retards need to learn how to take profits, holy shit.Why are you retards?Could buy 100 shares of GOOG and sell covered calls for the rest of your life but yikesOptions will bankrupt your ass!!Load gun, chamber round, open wideJesus. If I had $100,000 I'd just buy fucking QQQ in August and take my 50% gain.

Buy leaps dated 11/20 for 330 or 335, depending on your balls.  You will make steady, easy money.  It isn‚Äôt explosive like PRPL or whatever fucking retarded plays you making before, but it is steady and low risk.  I made close to 30% this week playing leaps.  Just wait for a red time and buy the contracts when spy is rocketing downward in that 5min, then you get a great value.  Then just stop looking and have hella monies in a few weeks.  I can‚Äôt believe more people don‚Äôt do this.  It‚Äôs because it isn‚Äôt as wild as yoloing into otm options dated for one week expiration but whatever I‚Äôd rather just make consistent money.I went from 330 to 300 and I'm just buy holding nowAs someone sitting on the sidelines, I wish I had bought and held.Three minutes laterr...Just close any accounts you have and transfer monies to your bank account. 

Day dream about what could have been, but know you beat the odds and got out...

I'm assuming you traded up to 300k plus...  If that's not the case...

He has change.With $3.50 he would have a shot, not with $3.40.bout tree fourdyDoesn't even have enough to pay the Loch Ness monster.He just needs to find an Instagram influencer who has a free course to show him how to make six figures a week with one simple strategyHe‚Äôs gonna use it to pay his electricity billsHe could get a large $2 kfc chips which is on special! Spend the other $1.40 on $ROPEA chip and a chair.If he'd simply bought far enough OTM FB calls late Wednesday, he'd probably have a couple grand right now.Yeah, buy fractional options on robinnoobThe fact his phone even wants to kill itself at the end... That's saying something.

Fuck bro. How are you gonna explain this to your wife's boyfriend now?this can sometimes bring the best out of people that deep fucking drive you really find what your made offNot unrecoverableWe have such an elite class of billionaires and millionaires, this is probably some teenager with money to play around with who wants Internet points.Why panic when you can farm internet pointsHow is $100k unrecoverable?  Do most of the folks here on WSB work at Wendy's?Dude... They're on Robinhood. 6 figures on ROBINHOOD.His name is rahul. You think he doesn‚Äôt have another 100 to play with?Prob not live changiglng for this guy. Different levels. I play with like 1k all time high in my acct bc I'm poor. Relatively speaking that maybe 200k for himThank you for your donation to the community.Too soonBut the transaction fee is 75 cents.tf thats way too costly for that strikeSo you're saying there's a chance.You would think spare money but nope.. it‚Äôs my Life savingsmoney make money.  i'm from 25k to 90k to 10k.

after you have over 25k, you can daytrade unlimited.

LIVE AND LEARN.

there' no success without failure.Of course I‚Äôm sad.. but now it‚Äôs a weird kind of freedom from all the stress100k and you lose it all on SPY puts and Wells fucking Fargo.

If you're gonna blow your account up, at least blow it up on something respectable.Fuck you went all in the dumbass bank stress test the wsb retards were pumping huh?The ironic part of this is that banks may actually be rotated into being inflated like tech stocks. If you would have bought calls that did not expire till at least a month from now, you would still be better off than expired options. And WTF why play the banks when all of TECH is SKYROCKETINGSPY and Wells Fargo. Yep, we have a true and true retard here, fellas.Dang! Sorry for your loss. :(

But I would be lying if I didn‚Äôt say that I chuckled when you ended at _‚Äùabout Three fiddy‚Äù_> WFC

This man bet his life savings on wells fucking fargo. I lost my ass on SPY calls and XLE calls, but not wells fargo.This makes my bones hurt.You Play with WFC..... i dont feel sorry for you nowIn a world of the fed just printing money... why did you not capitulate and buy spy calls? I got burned on like $2K and realized that for now stocks only go up.... it was free money dogI also bought WFC calls like a retard lol they went worthless so quicklyTurn your phone upside down, can‚Äôt go tits up!Can you post what your next moves are gonna be so I can inverse you?You must be new. OP is a degenerate but 100K loss isn‚Äôt even close to all time greatest WSB retardationBecause options can help you get more, if he was selling puts (cash covered) and covered calls he‚Äôd be able to compound his gains with much less risk. Also Options can help you lock in gains too in the case of Mark Cuban. Just gotta know how to use them.Why have 100k when you can have 1 million, or 5 million or 10 million. You see all these chaps get 1500% on KODAK in 2.5 days and you think if you just have one 15 bagger on your 100k you'd be set for life.What would you do with it? Serious.Been there done that.. lost about 60k and said good bye to casinos for good nowYep.. took me 106k to learn nothing is PermanentOr opened his account when the market crashed... like meOnly a true God tier autist can make a retard feel betterSome? You mean one.I...I gave him a dolla..You open an account and do nothing watching on the side reading business insider top 10 stock articles.  You see what money you could have made if you had the guts to just start investing back when tesla was 800 but your going to buy the dip as soon as it's at 700 your in. It keeps going up so you give up on tesla and amazon so now you discover wsb and you watch introduction to options on youtube and you spend your day scrolling wsb chuckling and you want to become an autist. All the months of watching from side and stress of taking the plunge made you decide fuck it and you jump. You make a 20% return and you tell everyone how its quiet simple and you have a clear strategy. You start losing and losing some more down 50%. You change strategy now we are talking, you tell all the people how naive you were and you have doubled your money back to 10% down but now your the king of the world having learnt your lessons and earned your stripes. 1000% here I come. Your batt is low. Your balance is 3.50$. And the nurse refills your edible play dough because you ate the last batch but you promise you will not eat the new ones especially green it's your favourite color.So true. SPY 350 8/12 calls so much cheaper than therapy thoI learned about my weaknesses while playing poker. I got them nearly entirely under control, which is effectively not under control at all since you can easily wipe out a bankroll in an hour. There's always a table big enough to let you go all in. 

I could go for weeks or months at a time, making steady gains, building my roll, moving up, and then one night with a few beers and I could blow anywhere from half to all of it. *But I'm a good player! Every time I redeposit and stay disciplined I make really good money!* Bullshit. Doesn't matter how much you make if you still have it in you to lose it all at once. 

I took down three big scores in one crazy weekend and used the last of my discipline to cash out up and quit the game for good. Now I have boring investments and read wsb and wish I could play along but know that if I started I'd eventually lose it all.Can‚Äôt even get a new charger for $3.40The ultimate gains...just get a software engineer job broWhen I lose $40 playing poker: fuck this I have a gambling addiction 

When I lose $1000 in the stock market: I sleepHow would a student have 100k ?Any other insightful tidbits?Many people died, but this man got crucifiedYou mean 11th? That's the day he lost 50k lol

edit: The market also fell off the edge of a cliff that dayWFC calls and doubled down three times hoping for a swingHe has enough for the water cups thereI call that place four bucks so you nailed it.OchaA 300 bagger in this case üòÖFyou're just poorChill dudeOr Tesla man! If he bought Tesla at the beginning of the year instead of gambling away with options, he'd be at over $350k now instead of $3.50.Dude you are fine lolTSLA is so crazy volatile. You should have hedged.HoldWhat next move? I‚Äôve got like 3 bucks left there.. it won‚Äôt even get me a decent meal at Taco BellWhen you have $100k, you don‚Äôt trade like you have a $4.7k account. You make bigger moves hoping you turn the $100k into $1 million (just like you are probably hoping to get to $10k). It‚Äôs all relative...Thanks captain obviousim downI can tell you that it‚Äôs definitely Robintarded so noI had the same plan, but sold after rumors on Stocktwits of them going bankrupt.  Put that money into Plug and am flying high.  Hopefully the cruise line rumor is just that, a rumor.  Good luck.Dollar cost averaging the short term optionsI did do DCA by doubling down every time it fell..and that was the main reason for losing it all.. it was short term options so IV also fucked meIm Glad It helpedThe fuck, I hope the repair involved a new tire or 2Spoken like a true richboy xDMargins margarines and tendiesto record video? settings accesibility record screen,.

oitherwise RHI had multiple 50k one day losses it fucjibg hurts and it take weeks for me to get it back and then it happens all over again.  

I jeed to get over that humpHow do you know that?
This could be like losing a dollar in the washer to him.He was gamblingHow?If his timing was terribly bad and he played it all on gold at the strikes it's possible, but idk reallyNot SPCE :(I got my father in law to open an acct. 2 weeks later he was having a problem logging in. I logged in through my phone and he had 400k starting out.

3 months later the same thing happens and when I logged in he had 671k.

He uses a flip phone, retired lawyer, and mainly makes money through his real estate & oil / gas.

Crazy. I opened my account with $20 and because of some lucky SPY puts in March it jumped up to almost $10k. I'm sitting on $3k for now, but it will vanish next week when my AUY calls, and Sept SPY puts expire.Grindr +Popular mobile gameHumblrSedditIts robinhoodEasily more with that amount ! I can pull  in about 500/ week selling puts  and calls on $NUGT with $44kJust remember, No amount of money in this world is worth that move.. if you doubt me ask your parentsSuch a minuscule annoyance compared to losing 6 figs, but also, just enough to send you over the edge.Phone: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you need to see anymore of this...battery low and shutting off.‚ÄùAm I the only degenerate with a low enough battery that I clicked it thinking it was mine?Imagine getting margin called by your phone*Tim Apple always knows best*Left an amazing taste in my mouthyou bought puts during the crash thinking you were gonna black swan your way into retirement didnt youI lost like almost 10k trading 0dte amzn calls today but posts like these make me feel better.

Almost.

Sometimes we just have to accept we suck dick at this, I suppose.Why the fuck did you invest all of it?im gonna guess TSLA calls lolNarrator: he didn‚ÄôtBuys at the topSeriously, please do.please go back to /r/investingWait this sub isn't just full of LARPers?The service industryYou stare at win and loss porn all day on this sub, you get diamond hand syndrom on OTM options and youre fucked.

Nobody here buys stocks, thats for pussies.These approaches are ridiculous. I put all my investment money into 3 funds that cover all US stocks, all international stocks, and all US bonds. Twice a year I spend 1 minute rebalancing. I do way better than these people losing fortunes while wasting time. I live my life while my investments grow. Micromanaging individual stocks while performing poorly is such a gambling loser thing to do. I‚Äôm sitting in a new Tesla that I bought in cash, my house is paid, and my kids college fund was complete when they got to 5th and 8th grade.Maybe when you're 80 you can finally give it all away to your wife's bf.i thought selling contracts was theta gang?If you were selling calls at any time in the past few months you'd be fucked. 

My point is that this phrase of "join the theta gang" and "sell contracts" gets thrown around all the time, but **you still need to choose the correct direction.** Unless y'all are just dumb and think selling contracts = selling puts.That just seems like a guaranteed way to make money. Is it that easy? Sell a FD call/put that has like a .0001% chance of expiring in the money?If you manage to get .5 percentage a day you would massively outperform almost any serious professional traderSame here man. Life is so much better swing trading shares for 500 bucks a week rather than the stress of trying to hit grand slams with optionsMy guy making 517.47% returns per year consistently.  0.5% per *day* is bullshit.the fact that you have upvotes is proof that this sub has gone tits upDefine market scalping.5 percent sounds pretty damn good compared to bankruptcy

Downvote my bitch ass as wellI'm here with my 400 and im just barely making a dollar a day right now üò≠üò≠Your just trying to make 12.50 each day? I‚Äôm not judging just want to make sure my math is right. I‚Äôd think you‚Äôd be able to make 100 a day at least. Not trading options. Just shares. 

But what am I saying, I am not making 100 a day lol. But I‚Äôm risking super small trades right now trying to learn.

I know it compounds. Just using 25k as a starting point for discussion.2.5% per week will build the fuck out of an account 

That‚Äôs 32k per year, more than most skilled jobs. Increase the % as you become a better trader. It‚Äôs a marathon bro you‚Äôre doin it righthttps://www.tradingview.com/x/nzzl5Yg0/  degenerate here, killing it at 2% a day ;)Bro Jesus I see these everyday on here. Take out 80k leave 10.  If you can‚Äôt make something happen with 10k then the 90 would‚Äôve been fucked anywayyou're in the black 90k, thats rare enough. withdraw the original, keep the 90k in profits and use only that no matter what.Heed my advice man. Take out your principle or hell cash out and get your self something nice. I was up bigly and proceed to lost my ass. Get your love one something nice. This market is eff up and diamond hand can hurt or help. I diamond hand in June peak where the index rally thinking the coco is gone to drop 5% the following day. Yes I went short on the run up and long at the top.we were green EVERY day this week. How was it a hard week?Cash gang is stupid, either buy ETFs or [do what I'm doing](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i2fms7/psthu_margin_play/)Since no options are available yet on a stock that just IPO'd, you're saying his only chance is fictional?but then you have to long TSLA and hope you don't got caught bagholding when they drop 30% in a week.Or get ass raped by Battery Day, or by cybertruck factory built ahead of schedule, or a random Elon tweet.Buying calls*Suckers of Elon‚Äôs Cock have entered the chat*Canoo, babythis is the kind of autism you can't learn in schoolHe has to change if he wants to have a chance.Be the change you want to see in the worldBut not a charge.A chance for a changeFor his chance to change, first he has to charge.Got dayum monstaLMAOHe'll probably have to move out of his houseProbably by using that last few remaining dollars to buy him a switch.> this can sometimes bring the best out of people that deep fucking drive you really find what your made off 

I dunno man, most people just like go on a backpacking trip or drop some acid. $100,000 is a pretty steep price to pay for a little bit of self-discovery.This guy earned his diamond üíéüëê hands badge.LOL he has $3.40You‚Äôre right, I still see almost tree fiddy in opportunities in his accountChip and a chair[deleted]Too soon indeed.  This stings...Not on RH‚Äôs trash softwareBS , you didn't slave away for 100k to lose it all.Damn that brutal dude... sorry manDont feel bad it happens to all of us, the casino always winI hope you're kidding my dude. The best way to have fun with this is if you play with money you can afford to lose. Never bet the goose.Twenty years ago, at 2001, I also lost 100,000 USD overnight, in the Argentina coup d etat & bank crash

I went to sleep rich and woke up poor and with riots on the streets. Search the videos, is quite interesting. I love a good riot and a city burning like anybody else.

Twenty years later I'm living at Caribe on a golden visa. In exile, but good.

You will recover. Don't worry. Money comes and goes.

Btw, fuck Kirchner and peronismoHaha u idiotRIPYou're either full of shit, or just incredibly idiotic. I know people talk about going full retard but why on earth would you put your life savings into liquid??Dude that‚Äôs for real your life savings? Holy crap man I‚Äôm really really sorry. The BEST advice when trading is ‚Äúonly invest what you‚Äôre willing to lose‚Äù. I know you‚Äôll bounce back man but I also know that has to sting a bit. Hope you‚Äôre okayDo you do for a living, what‚Äôs your annual salary?LolMy dude... I'm sorry bro..Please reach out to friends, family, or counseling if you need someone to talk to. Your life is so much more important than $106K.Dude. I'm so sorry.Should have gambled with $10K, maybe $20K, if you wanted to be risky. But the whole thing? I would feel like absolute, utter shit, for the rest of my life.

Hell, I blew a $65K inheritance on drugs and a fast car and still haven't forgave myself, but at least I had fun (I think I did anyway).

Hopefully you have a career where you can make that much in a few years at least.Or you could just open a TD Ameritrade cash account and have unlimited day trades...Is day trade better than options? I see a whole lot of shorting going onHumans can really get used to anything lol. The human mind is amazing. It can somehow turn "losing your life savings" into "freedom from all the stress".

I guess we are evolved to survive catastrophe.I remember Norm Macdonald saying he blew his entire savings of 400k at the casino and it was a really free Zen feelingI listen to chat with traders multiple times a week, and one trader was talking about psychology and how a trader is willing to take fat losses and break rules or deviate from the well defined plan, even if it would have been successful, in order to alleviate short term discomfort in a trade or even the stress from trading. It's important to be aware of this human tendency while tradinghonestly this is prob healthier than being hung up on it.The world is more than just money. Not sure if it will help.... but I lost $3K back in the day (it was like almost all my networth at the time).... and stupidly enough.... this YouTube video really helped me look light of it.... you will come back 


https://youtu.be/4DfhRoYgEsYThe stress of having $100K!?!?Totally with you man

I got fucking crushed for months as a gay bear in april and may. Down ~$30k

Waking up every morning just to start the day seeing how badly JPow had savaged my arsehole was driving me mad. 

I have taken a pause from trading options until I get next bonus, and im much happier now wothout all that worry and constantly checking RHWas this all earned money? Or profits?Bro you had 100k if you woulda just bought shares you wouldn‚Äôt of had to work anymore. I woulda even given you a pick Appl or any other tech stock that drives spy broIts a hard lesson learned, but from today on forwards its a fresh start.I didn‚Äôt lose as much but lost a decent chunk of my savings and hurts bad knowing what could have done with the money  but there is truth to it of the freedom.  It‚Äôs over now and can start trying to pick up life again, learn from it, and figure out(not options) ways to save and make it the money 
Good luck man and best wishesSo like where did you come up with the initial $100k?  Always wondered this when I see these loss porn posts.Hedonic treadmillyeah id take that over having 100k any day............^.^^.^^^.Thats It. I lost it all back in March. Still feel a bit bugged every once in a while, but overall I'm doing much better than before I Lost all my cash.You have been purified in the waters of redemption, cherish this brief moment before you rise from the ashes, very few people get baptized in the abyss, consider yourself lucky.Now THIS I get. I put some cash into FanDuel last Spring and it kind of consumed my life watching shitty as NCAAB games every night. I actually know a player on San Francisco (Shabazz) and there is NO reason I should ever know a basketball player on San Fran U or U San Fran whatever the school is. Once I went all-in and lost it all I had so much more time on my hands to do other stuff it was great!Freedom? Freedom from having to choose which high end restaurant to buy your take out from? That sucks, man. I lost $10K but made all my money back and then some and I couldn't even get over that.Once that feeling wears off the panic will set in.Everyone in the thread guessed TSLA or some other meme shit.

But nah, OP was just donating to MMs for WFC.Take it easy on the fella now

There should be a rule, though, that once you‚Äôre under $100k, you can only buy shares ‚Äî even WFCLike GNUsWhat IS the greatest WSB loss ever?That‚Äôs the problem. Knowing how to use them. It takes a lot of time to learn how this shit works. There‚Äôs a reason why theta gang is fuckin scary, you gotta know how to use delta and hedge gamma. Shit gets wack in a market this volatile too, even though the TVIX is crashing. Volatility is going to be a day to day thing from now moving forward.> Because options can help you get more

100k, index fund until retirement, kachingCould you ELI5 how *you* would trade $100k ‚Äúmess around‚Äù money and why it would work?

I made some money in the B!tco!n markets and am looking to gambleWhere tf are you getting that kind of money from? Obviously not stock market cuz...Explains it all right here. The man's addicted to the gambling rush.> Lost about 60k

let me fix that for you:

> Lost about 166k in different types of casinosBro where the fuck are you coming up with 160K to blow? Inheritance?You have a gambling problemYeah maybe you should stop gamblingTook me one woman to learn nothing is permanentTook you 106k to learn nothing. 

There, fixed it for you.Not trying to pile on here but a portfolio of 60% broad market equity fund, 30% bond fund, and 10% fixed income is essentially permanent.  It would take a complete collapse of society to do that in.Especially $106kSome people go their whole lives not learning that, good job for yocoulda saved 106k and listened to the song ‚ÄòCastles Made of Sand‚Äô by Jimi Hendrix.   
  
Same lesson, way less schmeckelsAnd me!It's like a Dutch windmill for retards. Thanks WSB!Yeah, he got $3.40 ain't buyin more than one.SHE GAVE HIM A DOLLA!underratedSums it up nicely lolI feel attackedbro that ending  LMAOSounds like you made a good move. As is apparent here on wsb, many have not been able to walk away like that until they‚Äôve burned everything to the ground. I know this is a place where everyone is supposedly a gay autist or whatever but my heart really goes out to people like OP. Always tempted to be a little jealous they had that such large amounts in the first place, but if I did and lost literally all of it due to my own decision making, they might have to put me somewhere safe for a bit. Dopamine is a real trip. 

Kinda happy I discovered this place before ever considering messing around with options. There are serious cautionary tales every week if not every daySure you can. Get some shitty dogshit one from eBay shipped from China or HK in 4 weeks. Then you can plug that baby in and reload your RH account and post "Shrek 2 slaps" on Tinder all you want before the fucker explodes.Dollar stores sell the cable and a USB wall plug that's $2 for something that might not burn his house down. He'd have enough money left over for a coke too.There are many careers that pay well, idk why this sub thinks having $100k means you can retire or something. I work in IT and make $140/hr. Of course I didn't start there but far from impossible.Why WFC, just curious? The financial press said other banks had huge write offs for bad loans and either had profits reduced significantly or had losses.why on god's green earth would you sextuple downJesus Christ, dude. Of all the plays you could've made, why did you choose WFC calls? It was a terrible play even before the pandemic destroyed its profits.Truly retarded, bless your heartI believe for you bro!but richer than OPHind set is 20/20 tbf. Either way he could‚Äôve bought a safe stock or mutual fundIn fairness, the $100k wouldn't even get a decent meal at Taco Bell.3/17 to 3/20, couple trading days he lost about 30K. 3/25 to 4/7 about 10 days ANOTHER 30-40K. I understand your point, and yes My goal is 10K right now, but THAT is the opposite of risk management. What happened? So desperate to make more money he said fuck it I‚Äôll just buy call options, and if I‚Äôm right I‚Äôll be RICH!!! Well he was wrong, oh so wrong... I got to 4.7K without playing the lotto, but with risk management, stop losses, option scalps, day trades, and so on. Why do we as a society always defend people who mismanage money? It wasn‚Äôt an accident...They havent sold any ships. And check this out....

He could have lied. But there's no reason to think he lied.Thanks, sadly not available in my regionThat amount of money is unobtainable in my current income. I‚Äôd be lucky to hit 100k by 60. That‚Äôs why I say that. It‚Äôs like a whole life of work just gone for meOoh that falling feeling oooohhh that falling feelingTake us into orbit, Mr. Malmsteen. We've seen enough...That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called a ‚Äúsmart phone‚ÄùThis hits too close to home.Didn't we all?U talking to me?With 100k he already had enough lol, I quit my job a few years ago with 10k now I‚Äôm closing in on a quarter mill net worth. All you need to retire is a few months bills and a plan on how to make money in place of the job.You can suck dick at something or just suck dick, we all have a choiceOr maybe just don‚Äôt take the riskiest possible playWhen I used to day trade, I did the same bs rationalization. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs people with much higher losses‚Äù ‚Äúthis is a lot, but the last loss wasn‚Äôt even bad‚Äù.  It causes you to ignore the fact that you‚Äôre not good at this. And down you go. The spiral of losses. I had to lose 300-400k to finally realize the signal I was getting (account went down to 40k. Had a side house that I could sell to get some money and I had a job). 

So, I Hard reset 5 years ago. Now I buy indexes long term. So glad I did. Now, I can sleep at night and I‚Äôm a millionaire. 

All it took was not doing stupid shit with my money.

There‚Äôs a reason why 99% of traders lose money long term. But, I‚Äôm aware, y‚Äôall gonna not care until it blows up. We gotta experience that pain first hand.Or puts. My special skill is buying TSLA when it‚Äôs in consolidation mode & stays flat. Theta Gang wins again.ya what did you do at 89k?It always isI‚Äôve been laughing at this for the last three minutes üòÇI imagine this in Morgan Freemans voicebuys and holds KODKI got jello hands. I buy at the top and sell at the dipBought Tesla at the top several months ago. Now I‚Äôm up $500.What are ‚ÄúLARPers‚Äù?Oh, yeah I'm totally LARPing this sub. You saying other people aren't? RIP.3x chuckecheese calls.I‚Äôm a bit of a Boglehead myself, but if you completed your kids college funds so young, paid off your house, and bought a Tesla in cash, it probably has more to do with your income and contribution rate than your investment strategy. I also invest mostly in a 3-fund portfolio, am maxing my 401k, etc., but I‚Äôm 34 and nowhere near paying off my house and finishing my kids college funds.

Also, this is a gambling forum. No one here wants to retire comfortably. They want to retire like Bill Gates or go broke trying üòÇ.Bruh this is wsbFagThis is WSB not investandretireearly.What 3 funds are you in?Shut up, squidWrite a book.I‚Äôll have you know... selling premium on ER‚Äôs can make you like $1k+ a week lol, and that‚Äôs not with a fuck load of collateral.. 

Theta gang works pretty damn nice on occasion..He's probably not going to live that longThis same joke won't ever get old, surely!Didn't you read the flair?It is, it‚Äôs the same thingIt‚Äôs not easy money. You‚Äôre putting a ton of collateral on the line for premium. The less chance it expires itm the less premium you get. Nothing is free moneyYeah it‚Äôs basically free money. If I had 6 figures to trade with that would probably account for 90% of my movesWhen you get that far OTM, the premiums and liquidity are terrible. Also it works until it doesn't, I sold a 10-delta strangle on SLV like three weeks ago. Like a handful of days before it mooned. Ended up cutting my loss at 225%.The problem is finding a stock to believe in and hoping each night some BS doesn‚Äôt happen that isn‚Äôt in your control. 

Would you mind sharing what swing trades you have done lately? Mainly ER related plays?do the math again bud, you're a legit moron if you come to the same conclusion twice. you might actually belong here with the rest of these retards. 5 % a day is 1.005 \^ 365 = 6.174

617% a year isn't too badI see this bullshit on here everyday, take out 80k and what? look at it? I know this subs a casino meme but you can always just make lower risk plays, those that say OMG CASH OUT treat this too much like an actual casino.He's selling the calls, not buying broNot my favorite pick but at least I don‚Äôt have to wait anymore. We‚Äôll see what happens monday> Canoo, based in Southern California, has said it plans to begin selling its first vehicle next year.

I don't understand why all these EV tech companies want to saddle themselves with manufacturing cars. Why doesn't Canoo focus on the subscription part of their service and just partner with one or more of the big automakers to provide the vehicles?

Similarly, why doesn't NKLA focus on producing H2 as cheaply as possible and building out H2 refueling networks?

Seems like they could save themselves a lot of capex and hassle of getting manufacturing right.When's the last time school made you any money? let my autism make you some tendies.It‚Äôs his chance to change.He has to charge tooBe the change you see left in your accountIf you had One shot Or one opportunity To seize everything you ever wanted In one moment Would you capture it Or just let it slip?Back to mom'sYo no joke, my buddys brother got back from an 8year tour in Iraq to find his wife had moved some guy in and is raising his daughter.

Sometimes it legit is life savings and OP is a retard, but everyone always seems to think it‚Äôs a trust fund baby with play money>it happens to all of us

That is demonstrably false.Yeah, OP is a greedy man. 

In India, we have high inflation and so investing money is the only way to save money. In the USA, you people don't even have high inflation. You can even keep cash laying around and you won't lose anything much.I need more of this story! How did you end up in exile?Not unlimited since trades have to settle. You can trade only as much as your account balance lets you. So the correct pressing would be that you are limited by dollars instead of number of day tradesYou day trade optionsi NEVER bother to learn options.   you get rich quicker but you also get broke quicker :)     there is no free lunch.

yeah.  i play both side,  buy and sell short.I Wouldn‚Äôt survive if I look at it anyother wayone of the basic human drives is certainty. once the money is all gone, it makes things pretty certain.Agreed. Wherever we find ourselves, that becomes our new base level and everything is relative to that. It's like when we sleep at night, our brain does adjustments to re-calibrate.Bro this guy sounds like he is full of shit. All the stress of having enough money saved up for retirement? Nobody says that.

Something like this only creates stress. No money to pay bills, take care of family, etc. All of this is fake, and this guy is a bad actor.100K can last quite a few years if you invest conservatively and live in SE Asia like Thailand, Vietnam or Philippines.Got a link to that clip?Some with alcohol, drugs, etc... people often choose long term negative  consequences to alleviate short term discomfort.Same with Texas Hold‚Äôem after 8 hours at the table and an utter lack of will power to walk away.OofLove futurama> Bro you had 100k if you woulda just bought shares you wouldn‚Äôt of had to work anymore.

Wut? Maybe if you live in a shack in Juarez and smuggle drugs up your bootyhole.100k isn't enough to retire off of unless you do some big brain YOLOs and turn it into a few millionTSLA only goes up babyGuh.I think 4 millionBiggest I can think of is achari01 at about -1.2milMartymoho was up there.It‚Äôs crazy that see people with such ridiculous capital who can wheel blue chips just gamble it all.

Or the trump bucksGod damn I miss TVIX for my IRA.right options is really hard to learn . max size i use buy call/put $1k . still learning how options work tho . wish i got spare $100k account selling puts on uptrend stocks will generate good passive income .Op has a fucking gambling problem.I am a silent spectator on the sub but jebus man, there is some retarded advice on here.

I just eat my popcorn watching people fucking throw their life away for some fake internet karma60K? Probably with this thing called a job, it‚Äôs not crazy money lol he just did a good Job saving and a better job losing it allI wonder if this guy is like in his 30s and has a good paying jobI'm 26. My comp was 68K, 80K, 124K, and 142K a year since I joined the workforce full-time in 2016. While take home is only 2/3 of that due to taxes and rent in NYC is expensive, 6 figure NW is not hard if you make good money (bonus points if you work part time during college), split rent, & save (bonus points if you get thousands per year for free via 401k matching). My NW is basically what OP has, though a third of it is in 401k and 30K is equity in cars. My liquid savings is very close to 6 figures at 26. If I lived with my parents for free, I'd have 250K+ NW, so it's also possible OP has some kind of advantageous set up like that. Rent has cost me 80K over 4 years ($1600/mo), excluding moving fees, furniture, & utilities.Took me one sock to learn some stains are permanent, and sometimes the trash can is the only way to hide your shame.Except for the pain and damage you're life with.Underrated commentWhen you let your guard down and feel like they are a permanent part of your life and that you can‚Äôt possibly lose them but they don‚Äôt feel the same way you do üò•Nah dude, now he knows what it feels like to lose 6 figuresSpoke like a troo normie LOLGODDAMMIT WOMAN!You must have your own business?Prolly with warren buying boaüî•But boring?^ underrated response right here üòÇI‚Äôm not defending his actions, but I‚Äôm giving you his rationale. Everyone thinks they are a pro-investor or trader when they are running hot. What‚Äôs going to happen if you fall back down to your starting capital? Or worse, if you go into the red. Everything in your brokerage account should be money you are OK risking. There are no guarantees in the stock market. Remember, if it were so easy to make $$$ sustainably in it, everyone would be doing it. Just some food for thought.That sucks, but there are several others. Good luckQuit your job and use that time to improve your skill set for a better jobHe lost that faaaaaaaallling feeling now it's gone.

Gone.

Gone.

Oh whoa whoa.Any feeling will do at this pointI bought calls.I have a year worth if bills. No idea how to make money without the job.Generally cases like yours are an exception not the norm.

Plenty more have failed with more money.

That said I'm interested in your story - howd you make your nut?>and a plan on how to make money in place of the job.

Unless that plan is passive income (from 10k? lol) that's not retirement.Yeah.

There's way to mitigate risk but I didn't. If I follow my mental stop loss, it would have been a $200~$300 loss, or even a $2k loss at most with an actual stop loss. But alas.Yeah I'm not at that point yet. Probably because I'm still up.

Hopefully I don't have to get to selling a property or two to realize it.

Thanks for this btw. After losing 10k in one day wiping more than two weeks of consistent scalp/day-trade gain. I'm re-examining things. There's a reason why my mid-term and long-term accounts are doing better than ever while my trading account is in limbo.I knew Tesla would finally move today and jumped in big. (Chose the wrong way)I hate this fucking game so much.  If I had $100k, I‚Äôd be buying long and selling the fuck out of Theta and not even thinking twice.Lost 90%Ate shit.You know it's bad when OP is too embarrassed to say..Tots, lolyou have low standards.You're retarded and really need to diversify

50% KODK and 50% SQQQOne of usLive action role play. Role playing irl. So they are saying ‚Äúpeople actually trade here?

It fucks you out of everything once evert 10 YearsYou're getting 1k/week but what is happening to the underlying?Tried selling my first call for research purposes this week.. bought a fastly 160c on Wednesday and sold the 150.. sold on Thursday before close.. made $50.and what if it moves against you? Shit aint that easy cuhHow much capital would you need to make an average of $1k per week selling premiums?AIDSYeah I‚Äôm plugging the shit into options profit calculator and it looks great until it isn‚Äôt.Can you give me an example of a good trade? 

I‚Äôve never sold a call/put before. Does the contract always run until expiration? and if it‚Äôs OTM you keep all the premium?This week a lot with PLUG and SQ. But I like to just look for things such as breakouts or clear trend lines on the 20 SMA and trade with them. Set stop losses  key levels and let the trade go on autopilotA = P(1+r/n)^nt  

A = $25000(1+0.005/1)^365  

A = $154,366.32 

If you‚Äôre making 0.5% a day then you are making an effective 517.47% yearly profit. What the fuck do you mean came to the same conclusion twice it‚Äôs literally basic maths and that was my first comment you weaponised transvestite.  

Either you‚Äôve been making .5% profit for a couple days/weeks if you‚Äôre lucky or you‚Äôre lying. You‚Äôre not getting that sustainably year round.Too bad the market is closed on weekends though.I don't think that's the way the math works. LolBuy real estate.Man I‚Äôve gambled enough to know that YES, this is EXACTLY like a casino lol you can even get an advance on your deposit in case u just can‚Äôt wait to playright, if he is selling naked TSLA then he is crazy and covered leaves you holding bag.[deleted]Call me crazy, but I‚Äôm buying $50k worth of PSTH shares.

If they're old enough to have earned that money themself, then they should have the sense to walk away, and if they're not, then one would hope the source of those funds would cut them off from them.Actually, 15 timeslmfaoIs this a Wendy's?Holy. Fuck.

No way you actually lost your life savings, wtf dude.Dude wtf?! I know wsb is all shits and giggles when you yolo and lose all your money or win big but that's pretty crazy to blow off your life savings like that. You could have bought good stocks instead of options with that kind of money and still capitalised on good returns while they compounded for the rest of your life. Sure you weren't gonna double your portfolio overnight but you could still have enough returns to become financially independent in a 5-10yrs of responsible investing and saving. Makes for a boring wsb post but at least it'll keep you safe.Lol. True wsb. You deserve a badge.But at least you had fun?I didn't understand what greed truly is psychologically and why it's a sin until finding this sub and tradingYou're comment literally reaffirms my initial comment. Unlimited day trades without being penalized with PDT. Like most brokers, cash typically takes till tomorrow to settle and be considered buying power if you buy/sell on the same trading day. 

I can take $1000 and buy 20 $50 calls in 20 seperate stocks, and easily flip out of the 10/20 profitable contracts, and I can sell my other 10 losing positions for a loss if I did not think holding was the right move. 

In terms of the PDT rule that people are penalized with, it is unlimited trades on T.D. Compare that to robinhood, you can buy and sell 20 different plays in the same day, but the next day they hit you with a ban, and you're only able to close positions/not open new ones for 30-90 days, can't remember but it's made for noobs at trading, and T.D. Ameritrade's platform is liberating in regards to PDTThis king is already picking up his crown damn, lesson to us all.I agree with this. Had a similar experience losing about 1/3rd of what you lost. Take a break. Get some extra sleep in the morning. Come to WSB and enjoy posts with Loss flair.When neanderthals came to pillaged our caves and took our women and children. The only thing to do is to carry on.

The ones who dwell on the past died out.Bro I‚Äôd already be in the dirt. You‚Äôre very strongDude, take care. It‚Äôs just numbers in your account.Did you never look at this sub and see the dozens of people doing the same mistake as you? You're supposed to learn from other's misfortune.You know, I'm 100% with that. Life was less stressful before I started waking up at 6:30am everyday to look at fucking candlestick charts.100k isn't enough for retirement. If he's got a steady job and just does passive investment, he could make that up in 3-5 years by maxing out 401k and IRA.[deleted]That sounds like an addiction it obsession perhaps? The guest trader was referring more to trade management, as opposed to a strategy, and how if you follow a plan that you know is valid, you refuse the desire to exit the trade and end the suffering lol more effectively. Nice username btwLOLNah you could probably churn that into liveable income selling cash secured puts and wheeling into covered calls imdefinitelyü§ëI didn't know this existed until 30 minutes ago and have been crying from hyperventilating laughter for those 30 minutes. ü§£ü§£ü§£Every time I am about to do something extremely risky and stupid, I have alarms that go off and they sound like "Guh"And was that a RH user?Whatever happened with that? He still paying that down or did robinhood work something out?I basically threw 100 bucks away to learn how options worked. Learning about them by going way OTM, and just watching how they react day to day. The issue is people think it‚Äôs a casino.

I don‚Äôt want to ever stop making money cause I think it‚Äôs fun so I wouldn‚Äôt want to do that. My idea of being retired is being retired from working for other people lol not retired from making moneyIf you had 100k you'd be saying "if I had 5 million I'd just..." 

Gotta crawl before you ball, learn $500 lessons on your way to $500,000. It's ten o'clock do you know where your lambo is?i mean he uses Robinhood so i doubt he knows how to theta gang without panicking when his portfolio is red prior to options expiration lolHow many different ways can you blow up your acc selling premium in the theta gang?  
Is it very very unlikely? Or just worth the risk?You must be fun at partiesWhat a portfolio lmaoGood manBecause Sir. This is a Wendy'sI think you replied to the wrong thread.I tried to sell straddles on FB this week and got boned. I usually pick high IV options and sell straddles but so far it‚Äôs probably no better than holding spy. Much more entertaining though.Can you explain a little more please?I was "theta gang" for a while, until I lost 2 months of gains and then some in one trade. most of the guys that spout "theta gang" here are just gambling on weeklies, hell, thats what I was doing. Gambling on weeklies is not a theta gang strategy, it's a casino gang strategy. Theta gang actualy takes advantage of theta, you cant do that with weeklies.https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/i0mkv3/10k_to_100k_in_5_months_23k_in_deposits_and_67k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Here‚Äôs mine, exclusively from selling options. Buying options is a fool‚Äôs gameWell I just re-broke even plus a little bit from -95% lol, so my graph is ass lol 

But I played beyond and made $420 premium (more if I didn‚Äôt sell at open) 

And if you played Etsy with puts that would have also made you $500...

If the stock doesn‚Äôt move within the implied move you‚Äôll make money... and a decent amount lolI never said it‚Äôs easy lol

I just said on occasion theta gang selling for premium on ER weeks can make a decent chunk of money without needing a ton in collateral (I‚Äôm talking about selling cash covered puts) lolI‚Äôm honestly just talking about cash covered puts to enjoy the ER premiums.. it costs however many contracts your willing to sell, the more expensive the stock the more collateral at risk 

And the worst that‚Äôll happen is having to buy shares 

It doesn‚Äôt work every week though, that‚Äôs why I said on occasion lolIt‚Äôs good if you‚Äôre okay with realizing it‚Äôs not for investing or multiplying your money. It‚Äôs just for a consistent 1-4% monthly gain.Just go to YouTube and search wheel option strategy, selling cash secured put, and selling covered callsHey I just learned this in calculus! Neat!Except there are only like 250 trading days in a yearthat's really bad, where can I get my loss fix now?Well it is, except there aren‚Äôt 365 trading days in the year. If he does that same calculation with 252 days, it would be 351% per year. Still very good.Why do people think RE is some guaranteed easy investment?[deleted]Which part of calls are cash secured puts?Not sure where the guy mentioned any kind of putsChanging his chanceGonna have to utilize the entire basement if that‚Äôs the case bud.He could always secretly live in someone elses basementPissed away?

Money can be earned through work again.The source of those funds....


Like his job? Believe it or not some of us actually earn quite a bit of money and if we just saved it up we would have far more. But we prefer to play fast and loose with it because we can earn more. Unlike your broke fast food working assBut if he does that, he'll be on such a hot streak that he should jeep going.this guy mathsYep, you‚Äôre right. I have realized later today and returned to correct myself, but you already did.I lost my life savings too... couple hundred grand... I was in Wealth Management and lost it all in a 3 year long meth bender... not sure which way I would rather lose ones life savings... via trading or in the chaos of tweakerville... I feel for OP man that‚Äôs rough thoAs a retarded multi-millionaire that should be assistant managing a car wash, 100k is shockingly easy to make and if you are smart enough to YOLO 100k and lose it, you are smart enough to get it back. 33k a year is 36 months and any autist can pull in 60k a year and save half worst case.what the fuck is this bitch ass advice, get out of this subLeave him alone jackassGambling addiction is realto FI from 100k in 5-10 years with a traditional buy'n'hold portfolio? not happening.Youre on drugs if you think you can get to financially independent w 100k in sharesIt‚Äôs not really helpful to tell the guy what they could have done.You don't get it. 100k in the bank is straight up middle class drudgery shit and is depressing.

He's trying to be a baller not some mid level loser with a toyotaYou dont think he realised that the second he lost it all?Lame dude... It's easier to YOLO TSLA $2000 9/31c and leave it to Papa ElonYou don‚Äôt think he knows that, you fucktard? He posted this, didn‚Äôt he?

They have a whole city.Fullmetal AlchemistYou misunderstand RH. The default for RH is that they are granting you margin, so you aren't trading with a cash account. Therefore you fall under PDT.

This was something we discovered through the course of battle. Keep in mind the Neanderthal brain was just as powerful if not more than humans. So we began ambushing battles through spear propulsion and long distance fighting. That‚Äôs how we took em out homie.That‚Äôs the main reason I got out of trading many years ago. It was far too stressful. I just decided to start dumping as much as I could into my 401k and Roth IRA. I‚Äôve only recently picked it back up but I make really small trades just trying to learn as much as I can about options.another notable basic piece of human psychology is never being entirely satisfied and thinking the grass is greener on the other side.Tell me more...In my example the assumption is the player is up. The plan you think is valid is to continue to sit at the table and continue to play hands but you‚Äôre growing weary of playing tight. So you start to play looser because you want to get to a point, high or low where you finally can get up from the table and call it a night. You make bad decisions when you play loose and risk losing a lot. The stress is sitting at the table for so long.

Maybe a bad comparison, I could certainly be misunderstanding. 

On the username, thanks :) it gets passed all content filters and if you get it you usually get a chuckle out of it. If you don‚Äôt get it it flies right over your head.

Uh, don't listen to this guy. If you have a steady job and saved up 100k, keep working and keep saving. Doing what he says is as stupid as any other method of playing the market.Nope.  100k is not enough to wheel indefinitely.

I know what your saying, but I could literally read every god damn book on how to play Craps in a casino, and still not have a god damned clue until I literally step up to the table and throw the dice. To your point, it's what I did and now I'm a god damned expert at it now, but it's probably the same with playing options.My brother basically told me the same thing. How exactly does watching you lose money work? I want to get into trading but at the same time I‚Äôm in a good spot for someone my age (~$7k saved up 18 years old) but in realityI‚Äôm too scared and might just wait till I graduate college to start and just buy index funds or FAANG stocks or smthI put <1% in options just this week. I have no idea what Im doing. I'm hoping that changes before it's all lost.Dude get out of here with this shit, I'm 24 years old and I lost more than $100 several times this week just by looking away from the screen for a moment.Everyone on the sub* still like a bottom 5% compared to average population.Well I think we‚Äôve established OPs brain doesn‚Äôt work in the normal wayHe could have a high paying job that he expects will always be there to replenish his losses.Then you don‚Äôt make great money lolFr this dude lost 60k gambling and 100k, basically gambling again.I am writing this message on a guitar.GOOSE![You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDi7qOhECW8) made famous by Top Gun.He is retard, yesSo you are saying I can work 24 hours a day or 8 hours a day?LOL - jobs are by FAR the best way to make money. Please, don't listen to this person.

Yes, some very select group will get rich enough to live without having a job.

Most people will have to work to make their money and the truth is those people are usually more wealthy in the end than people that are constantly trying to dodge getting a job.Lol. Acting like you had some kind of grand strategy. You just got lucky gambling, friend.Digital vegetables? Tell me more.It‚Äôs in the lambo libraryThis is legit advice thats gonna be glossed over by WSB retards. Nobodys willing to learn the 500 lessons because they think they're autistic geniuses who don't have to drink martini glasses of piss just because they're smartiesBasically the absolute worst that can happen is you are long on a stock and selling calls and the stock goes to 0. Which is what can happen to anyone holding long. 

2nd worst is getting stuck with an ITM call (or the inverse with a put) at a price lower than you were holding long on. You can then take the loss, which is almost certainly not catastrophic if you were watching it, or roll to the next week/month and hope things turn your way while you continue to collect a trickle of premium. 

I just got into theta wheels and it's a lot less stressful than buying options. The potential for both gains and losses is much more limited, so it isn't as exciting. Just be careful around earnings report time.What you know about a 4 for $4No this is Patrick!Oh, i did. Sorry.High IV options are high IV for good reason.It ain‚Äôt as easy as set it and forget it. There‚Äôs a bit more nuance into picking the correct ‚Äútheta gang‚Äù strategy for the situation, including active management of ones going against you. Even running the basic wheel needs some attention from time to time. 

To mochi‚Äôs point, I‚Äôve had some rough weeks this year due to sudden unexpected movements. I haven‚Äôt busted my account like some here, but let‚Äôs say if I had been on the buy side of things I could have been more agile during the choppier parts.Best theta strategy is to manage at 50% profit. Highest probability of success but also a lot of work.Weeklies lose theta the fastest, selling weekly FDs is theta afSo can I do that with monthlies then? I've just been selling puts on MA, MSFT, V and a few others all this time while FOMOing over some of the behemoth gains being posted here.technically the best theta decay is on weeklies, or dailies, but you do have to sell closer to the money which makes big movements a risk.How does weekly itm debit spreads not cash in on theta? I bought a weekly on AMD, and they went down 3% today. Still made money on them because the theta outran my delta exposure. Itm debits work as long as you are directionally confident and go deep itm enough.I've been doing ok with my pmccs with SPY that start on a down day slightly OTM about a month out. Been rolling out the short positions for credit to higher strikes an exp out once there's about a 10-20% benefit to do so, and buying back short positions at about 20% gain. Been keeping it small, won't try to massively scale this strat.

I ain't gunna get yacht money anytime soon but looking for singles and doubles.you're a fake prophetfakeNo such thing as a consistent 1-4% monthly compounding gain. Maybe if your Jim SimonsOk so you weren‚Äôt just talking about doing naked calls and puts. 

I understand the basics of options I just don‚Äôt really understands what happens when you write them. The thing will go to expiration right?Still making absurd, several 100% annual profit. Not sustainable.Hold over the weekend and watch it crash and burn?You could throw your money away to the Twitch whores?Are you sure?It's not, there are no ready investments. It's just less risky. You might lose 30k over 10 years instead of 80k in 2 monthsEver heard of a down payment? Use that 80k as a down payment on a rental property and use that rental income to pay the mortgage.

You had me at "trying to escape poverty", but then I read the rest of that sentence and realized you were just trolling. 

I hope the only people with $100k liquid risking it all on this sub are people who can actually afford to lose it.How long would it take you to save $100k in cash?>He was here just like the rest of us trying to escape poverty and make a million.

By  gambling.Aaaaaaaaaaand its goneJeepMaking 100k when you already have multi-millions is a lot different than making 100k starting from 0100k is not shockingly easy to make. I think you are privileged.Just noYea man, because income taxes don‚Äôt exist and drugs are free üé±When you are not millionaire, you can't risk your life support, that's what rich doesn't understand, you depend on the smallest amount of money for livingYeah, just watch some Gary V, flip some baseball cards, hustle some garage sales, and BOOM! 100k.Sometimes, you need to be human and share a bit of compassion for one moment. One tiny moment.it's gotten so popular that these posts get upvotes now. really no shame in these people.You're lame af, some loser Wolf of Wallstreet wannabe.The fact that that guy has more upvotes than you really speaks to the state of the subwow i am really impressed by the size of your dickFuck youshut up dude so tired of these postPeople need to learn from their mistakes, not be coddled and repeat themPeople like you are why he yolo'd away his life savings in the first place.This guys literally lost his life savings, give him a break...No, you leave *him* alone.No 100k won't make you financially independent. But if he was able to save up 100k worth of savings, he can continue saving at the same levels and even if he saves up $500 a month, at a 15% rate of return compounded over 10 years he will have over half a million in the bank. It can be enough towards becoming financially independent if you decide to live a frugal enough life. On the other hand if he continues saving at the current rate for another 10 years, he'll be up over 2 million which is definitely enough to become financially independent. Even if you bring down the rate of return to a more achievable 10%, he'll still have over 1 million.it could be helpful for the next hopeful autistJudging by how things normally happen on this sub, I doubt it!He would lose it all the next day then as per it is tradition here...If you try that once, you are likely going g to keep trying until you go to fridge and see no trendies, or fridge....I'm not sure you're trying to prove. I've used RH for years with no margin, and I was forced to hit 3 day trades in 5 trading days after 4-5 years. I had a T.D. account that was more of a long term, but when RH hit me with PDT, I switched to T.D. fully and will never use Robinhood again. 

And I'm not misunderstanding anything, T.D. will not penalize you like RH does. And when you say "if you don't read shit when you sign up, don't sign up", you sound very ignorant. Literally EVERYBODY skims through those long rules/regulations/restrictions they warn about, including yourself. 

WSB is a cesspool of toxic people nowadays.The real advice hereNow this is why I joined WSB. LMFAOCan't go tits up at this pointAlready amI actually learned something similar at the Natural History museum in Madrid that we beat them *because* they were faster and stronger. They took bigger prey head on during hunts and suffered more casualties because of it.

Us being smaller and weaker had to get creative and use more advanced tools like ranged hunting weapons, while they relied on the short range spear and charging at their prey.Or maybe the fact we all have 1-3% of neanderthal genes shows that we assimilated by...Seducing them, and we all descend from a long line of murderous dancers.Neanderthals didn‚Äôt have language though. They couldn‚Äôt teach anyone anything or communicate very well. That gave humans a huge advantage to work together better and teach how to make weapons and coordinate attacks.>In my example the assumption is the player is up. The plan you think is valid is to continue to sit at the table and continue to play hands but you‚Äôre growing weary of playing tight. So you start to play looser because you want to get to a point, high or low where you finally can get up from the table and call it a night. You make bad decisions when you play loose and risk losing a lot. The stress is sitting at the table for so long.

Damn, how true that is. Great insight.At least not -100%, he still end up with a higher networth than most of us here.I watch a few card counters on YouTube and they are very good at calculating risk. Even counting cards and employing some other techniques with a $1 million bankroll there is still a small chance of losing it all. The larger your bankroll the less it is but it‚Äôs still there.Counting cards only works when your playing with an actual deck and not an automatic card shuffler. It's how casinos are turning it back to 100% chance again, and why I won't play those games.It is, and you‚Äôre right. It helps to learn while you play, but having a basis of knowledge and knowing when to leave the table with your money is a skill tooDon‚Äôt be an idiot, put your money into a Roth IRA, dollar cost average into index funds, and only speculate with what you wouldn‚Äôt think twice about blowing for a night out. Come here for the loss and gain rubbernecking, but for every crazy post like this there are thousands of people like you losing their $7k, not making a post, and  miserably realizing that they just set the equivalent of a nice used car on fire.

Educate yourself on options by paper trading so you actually understand the risks you‚Äôre taking with your play money.What do you mean?I‚Äôm 26 and lost my trump bucks in a day because I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing. Decided I needed to learn, after I decided to come at this thing level headed.I'm also 24 and had a return of 2.68% just this past week... know what you're getting yourself into.He‚Äôll fit right in here then.I‚Äôm the sole earner in a HCOL area with a wife and two kids.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èHonestly, like 90% of calls purchased far enough out in March would have made absolute fucking bank.

Imagine what BA 120c Jan21‚Äôs probably look like if they were bought when Boeing was $100I guess... I have online stores so I‚Äôm not really ‚Äúworking‚Äù 24 hours a day per day, more like 2-4 packaging, printing, responding,  listing and what not depending on the day. But I make money 24 hours a dayIt depends on the person and their qualifications for sure... if you have a college degree in a specific field that paid you a lot of money for your time your situation may be different. The best job I qualify for is 60 hours a week selling cars making 7-10k a month, so if I can beat that on my own, that‚Äôs what I should do. If your best job is 50k a month then you would have a higher number to beat, or if you were making 2k a month it would be real easy to beat that.Well.. no. I don‚Äôt do it anymore because what I was doing doesn‚Äôt work, but I was essentially being paid to advertise a coin, in coin, then I would sell the coin.KNAWLEGETime to get a library card baby!Going itm on covered calls is great. I just take the loss on the call and sell the collateral for net profit.This dude get's it.Del taco can make 4$ go quite a ways too.As someone who got into options pretty recently, I would have been scared as fuck to sell anything around March-May.u/TwosFullofThrees  


Do you have a specific strategy picking Strike Prices with Deltas relative to IV?  


I have been picking SPs when the stock dips, and the premium is at least 1% of the SP.  


I haven't been paying attention to Delta and IV, but I do want to understand how I can use it to finesse my strategy.  


Is there a way you recommend to correlate Delta with IV? Example for CSPs I purchased earlier this week: 

* Delta: -35% / IV: 46.79%
* Delta: -29% / IV: 47.47%
* Delta: -24% / IV: 46.65%[deleted]How much work is it to put a pending limit buy to close at 50%? Like 2 seconds.Sweet spot to be milking the Theta is usually between 45 to 21 dte.

You can always asses the situation at 21 dte, roll or take profits etc.Not likely compounding. Someone that does it well will hope to collect 10-20% in premiumYeah that‚Äôs the goal, it‚Äôs a low risk strategy that won‚Äôt net ten baggers but it builds gains consistently and with almost no stressMoved into 100 shares of Microsoft last week, sold a call expiring today. Closed it when it was worth $.04 and sold another for next week for $200ish, bought a share. Rinse and repeat buying a share every week or two.It doesn‚Äôt always have to go to expiration. If you suddenly get a huge spike in any direction that is beneficial to you, you can opt to buy back those contracts to close your positions at a profit or roll it out further.I disagree about it being less risky. You have multiple factors you cannot control for, the largest  being the behavior of tenants and lack of liquidity. I prefer the market to RE for that reason aloneDid you move to Colorado for that or did you pick something local at the time?And if he turned it into a verb?Haha Jesus Christ. 

RIP to this poor schmuck.I don't think he was trolling. Some people here aren't in on the joke.Buy jeep. This is a sign.And then we gotta talk about actually saving 100k that‚Äôs even harderSo, I show up to this same building day in and day out and they deposit $4K every 2 weeks just for showing up.  It's a hard strategy, but it works.  Just need to go there and turn on a computer.It‚Äôs something you can save pretty easily, especially if you and your employer contribute to a 401k.Why? I‚Äôm not a millionaire and I blow all my money all the time. I‚Äôm still alive and kicking 15 years into being on my own. I did it for 12 years while making near minimum wage and now still do it when I make more.[deleted]Sir, this forum is strictly for gambling glamourization, please compose your behaviorMoment's over, let's ridicule him again> compassion

Okay, you've recognized that the top left and bottom left are bad. Now you need to make the distinction between the top right, and the bottom right. Print it out, tape it to your fucking wall, and remember.You lost me at 15% annualRate of return is historically 6-7%No. 100K PV with $500 a month PMT, compounded monthly at an annual rate of 10% is only 372K and at an annual rate of 15% it's 582K. I'm sorry, but there something wrong with the way you're running your numbers. Most likely your compounding and periods are correct, but you have it set up as if he's contributing 6K a month. Source: studied finance in college.Good point. These posts are good for something.TD does penalize you the same if you use a margin account. They will only let you close positions for 90 days. Go into your RH app, Account, Day Trade Settings, Turn off Instant Settlement. That disables margin on your account. Boom. No more PDT concerns.And, for the record, I don't skim. That's how I know all RH accounts are defaulted to margin accounts. Sure, if it is a mobile game, I'll skim, but when it involves tens of thousands of dollars, I'm not going to skim. 

I'm not being toxic. I'm trying to be informative and helpful. Saying "if you don't read shit, don't do it" is very sound advice. Calling someone ignorant, however, IS toxic.something something inverse cause autisticYep and when we battled them we did so at a distance because that was one creature a human didn‚Äôt want to tangle with lol. They were much shorter but even their women fought like Tyson lolI always heard they were also just less inclined to be friendly outside of their groups, whereas humans were almost always happy to see each other at the timeHow the hell did we get to the humans v Neanderthal subject ? This is why I come here...More like a long line of rapists.Plenty of studies dated back decades suggest that they could speak just like Humans because they had a hyoid bone. Maybe new data?My friends bought me into a poker tournament for my 30th at Foxwoods, assuming I‚Äôd shit out in an hour or so with 170 participants. Well 8.5 hours later I was at the final goddamn table with the second highest stack. I just wanted to be done with the tournament to be honest even with 13k for first place. I had to keep this mindset in check and make sure I continued to play very smart. 

I ended up in 6th and was beat on a sound hand by a shitty river card. I made 700 dollars but at the expense of not being very social with my friends at the casino on my 30th. 

The final table for an amateur like me is goddamn heart attack inducing. It was my first tournament and I was playing with pros.Card counting is useless but most Blackjack variants have 4% natural edge for players in total, very much including novices. With knowing the rules and simple strategy blackjack has the best player edge (up to 20%) in the entire casino, especially with a nearly 100% randomized card shoe.Yeah well tbh this place is not the advice column for making money.Sounds like you've got a great home equity line to tap into then, get on it.Fair enough, hahaGet ur kids to work and teach them how to gamble on stonksWhat kind of drugs?That's a good point.

Still for 99 percent of people a job is the best way to go.This lambo I have in the backgroundThat speed reading one though...https://youtu.be/TEoTQB7h3NQThats what I thought with my Spy 340 this weekHow do you close a written call or put? Does it not have to roll to expiration? That‚Äôs my main question.I disagree about it being more risky. You have multiple factors you cannot control for, the largest being the behavior of markets makers & algos and abundance of liquidity. I prefer the RE to the market for that reason alone. ...... Perspective is helluva drug.I was out there already I'll fully admit that it took a lot of luck. I waited and searched for a long time and pulled the trigger on a kinda shitty place in an area that I knew had potential which ended up getting developed faster than expectedIn pieces 

I‚Äôm going to buy some shares in some shitty penny stock in his name 

Recover some value from this lesson.That‚Äôs something that took me some time to realize. At first I through this was a sub for shits and giggles. And then I realized there are actually people on here losing their life‚Äôs savings. Gamble addicts.You just gotta #hustle and try hard and go to the gym and make drop ship scam ads on YouTube and you are setYeah pay all of your taxes, living expenses, insurance, entertainment, student loans, that medical bill, support your family (if you have one) and your not left with all that much.lolGuessing you don‚Äôt have kids or a newborn , medical bills , a mortgage etc etc . I‚Äôm making really good money for my area , around $80k. But after taxes, 401k contribution of 5%, health insurance , etc my take home is only $2,100 every two weeks or $55,000 per year.  My companies health insurance is a high deductible plan , meaning we‚Äôve had to come out of pocket this year for $8,000 for the birth of my son. Our mortgage is $1,600/month or about $20,000 yearly . All of the bills add up extremely fast leaving not much to save. Definitely not easy to save $100k. I finally have saved around $100k. It took about 6 years and the only reason I was able to is by selling my last house and making a decent profit. I‚Äôm guessing you don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to try and save with a family of 5?A 401k isn't really usable money. You're basically saying it will take 40 years to make 100k.Maybe if you live in a privileged rich country or you don't have to sustain to your familyI think he really doesn't need to hear this now. A year ago, yes, but not now.Yeah man this dude totally needs to hear "You know, in hindsight, you should have not lost all your money"It's amazing how many faggots are in thus sub. OMG BRO 100K !!!!! 

You can make that back a million ways. Fucking live a little you pussies. 

You have no idea how many people I know with 7 or 8 figs sitting safe and sound that have panic attacks daily. Their frugality is a fucking disease. 

Treat money as what it is, fun coupons for a shitty unsafe amusement park that's on it's way to bankruptcy court and will soon be ruins. 

Please don't kill yourself over a few shekels, kill yourself with shekels as God intended. 

Short of murding another human you'll never feel as alive as when you lose all your money, makes life worth living when you can tap into those rare moments of total immersion in the game.

 *those* cold and *timid souls* who *neither know victory nor* defeatGreat point man.. savedJust invest everything in technology stocks and you're looking at like 100% annual. 

Easy moneyIt is possible to beat the market, it is difficult but is also possible.Sounds hot. Now I want a time machine to go back and clap neanderthal cheeks.100 Mike Tysons with spears vs 100 English longbowmen. Who wins?Guess we evolved outta that one.It‚Äôs apparently a matter of debate. All primates have a hyoid bone. 

https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/could-neanderthals-speak-the-ongoing-debate-over-neanderthal-language

Either way when Homo Sapiens arrived it only took 5000 years for Neanderthals to go extinct. It‚Äôs still a matter of debate how much influence humans had in that extinction. 

I look forward to more discoveries in the future.Nice! No way I could stick at that for 4 hours, never mind 8.5 manThis is the waySelling drugs wasn‚Äôt profitable for me, I did that when I was like 19, got arrested.You say that but most people I know of that are my age work a job making $8-$15 an hour which is easily made outside of a job. My girlfriend runs one selling app on her phone that makes us like a $100 a day, the only reason you should work those jobs is if you‚Äôre like mentally handicapped or somethingNow I‚Äôm curious. What did the since deleted comment say?YepYou buy a contract on the market and your profit/loss is the difference in premiums.You close it by buying it back. The order, when you write a contract is a ‚Äúsell to open‚Äù. When you buy back that contract, it is a ‚Äúbuy to close‚Äù. If you are confused, try it with some paper trading first. It‚Äôll make sense once you actually do it.I wouldn‚Äôt be willing to move and it‚Äôs tough to buy anything in the area I live with that amount even as a down payment, but I was just wondering if you managed to buy something and flip it in an area you didn‚Äôt live cause that‚Äôs something I consideredThanks for the KNOWLEDGEMoral of the story; Don‚Äôt have kids lolI don‚Äôt have a family to sustain for sure, partially because I know I wouldn‚Äôt be able to. I have nephews and I can get my fix of having a legacy through things I help them learn. Privileged country for sure, though. I‚Äôm in the US and I went to a free boarding high school that provided food and only required qualifying by taking a practice SAT and another aptitude test. A lot of the people there were from pretty well off families and I was not shy about using them as sources for food, couches and showers for the next decade in exchange for labor and cleaning. I also did work for their parents often which would often net me more than I made at the warehouses/factories/retail stores I worked at.I agree, this does seem possible.That happened quite a lot so we all have like 2% Neanderthal genes (at least if your ancestors are from Europe)50 ScotsWell we‚Äôre too used to only seeing each other nowadays... back then you‚Äôd see other critters far more than your fellow man!Idk ya, I mean I am an attorney who gets paid a salary so I'm viewing it like that, maybe for younger people there are better ways to make money I guess.I forgot but it was definitely retardedOk so basically you are buying your own option back. Then you can just sell it right away if you don‚Äôt want to hold it?Yeah I gotcha. I may just make a couple small trades like $1 contracts and close them to see how it works. Thanks for the help.Please Venmo me your first month payment for the Money Maker Elite XPres program ASAPKNAWLEDGEI still see more critters than fellow man. Right now I see 2 birds, 2 squirrels, and two humans.

Make it 3 squirrels.Jesus Christ dude I‚Äôm only 24 how old are you to be an attorney that‚Äôs a cool ass job though if I had to work one.Yes, basically. For example, you write a call. You are obligated to sell your shares at the strike if exercised. But if you then buy a call at the same strike, you have bought the ability to buy the same amount of shares at the strike price, making your position neutral.



It's possible to close your position early in this way, and make money on the difference in premiums that you collected and paid.Ok. Did I miss the sale that was happening for only 2 more hours?EGARAG YM NI EREHI'm 26, I became an attorney when I was 25Ok so let‚Äôs say I sell a call option, which I wouldn‚Äôt really do because I‚Äôm not much of a üåà üêª and I see the price going up, I can just buy the same call option and the position is closed? Or do I have to then again sell the option I now own to fully close the position?

Thanks for the info BTW.That‚Äôs cool as shit I watch mad court tv so I‚Äôm kind of a lawyer too myselfYour position will close. Think of it like you are -1 contract (selling the call) and buying the call adds 1 contract and puts you at net 0. If the underlying moved in your favor then you will be able to buy the same contract that you sold someone but at a discounted premium, and there is your profit.



You're welcome, I'm still learning too. Good luck!Hahaha, honestly bro, you're not far off :DThanks I fully get it now. I just don‚Äôt want to get into a position where I‚Äôm assigned like 100 shares of aapl or something. I can‚Äôt afford that. 

I‚Äôve also read that options, in the US at least, can be exercised at any time before expiration. That‚Äôs kinda scary when you sell options. I‚Äôve read it almost never happens but it‚Äôs a possibility.This is why you only use this strategy on shares you would not mind owning.Shit. I don‚Äôt want to be a faggot. Better listen to TrumpIts called SPY not S-P-Y, only yuge faggots spell it out like thatMedia: Deep fakes will be used to undermine the economic and military infrastructure of Western society.

Wallstreetbets:Let's be real, we're already all faggots hereJust a PSA for a sec. This video only took me a bout 2 minutes to make. Imagine if the Twitter "hacker" put in some effort and posted this on Trump's page during market hours. While fun, this can be a dangerous tool in the future and it requires us to ask questions about everything we see and hear. Thanks for coming to my TedTalkYou mean QQQ CallsI am so glad I was sorting by new to find this.

There is no scape to faggotery.Trump the type of guy to pronounce it S-P-YThere is just something so special about el presidente, but I can‚Äôt quit put my dick on it.

But looking at the predictions well, $200 idk, hope it does, have started to track it myself haha. Also, any suggestions on websites I can look up where they make calls and stuff. Thanks mate

Edit: yes reading about the whole PURPLE thingy too, I guess that‚Äôs what is called hindsight I guessIt‚Äôs what people say when they bought at $27The people bitching about losses probably bought Monday at open at an all time high. Idiots. 

This is a meme stonk guys. Don‚Äôt force trades. Watch the stock for a few days and buy when the time is right. Buy on red days. Sell on green days. It‚Äôs not that hard. Prpl was swinging +\- 4% every day this past week.

a computer keeps track of how much money you owe at the end of your shift, but what we would do is collect the cash for an order without marking the meal as being handed out, then cancel the order after collecting

I'm being setup!Idk just remember this is a betting thing not "investing" we are here for the gamble so be prepared to lose whatever money you put inI bought 5 minutes before that dipTo be fair I think many people on this sub just are meming. I've seen 20+ purple loss memes and I think I've seen only one screenshot of a person actually down on calls.

Most are holding single contracts at best.

You basically gave away free money in a ton of posts and no one wanted it. It's the most hilarious thing I've ever seen.It‚Äôs just amazing to me that all you have posted about is PRPL for almost 6 months then last week we have at least 5 different posts reach the top of WSB.

Meanwhile average volume of the stock is 1m shares and it is being relentlessly shilled in a subreddit with 1.3m membersIt all began with u/dhsmatt2, crowned Mattress King, price of PRPLtards and with u/lurkingsince2006 who will only fuck on PRPL mattresses. They started posting solid DD on PRPL like 3-4 months ago and nothing was the same ever since.

PRPL is some mail order mattess company BTW, exciting right? Elon and Jeff don't have shit on this great company

Since then, u/lurkingsince2006 made like 3 million $ in gains and u/dhsmatt2 too.

OFC, when it mooned lots of tards, myself included, bought shares and calls at the top. After a few red days, some of us doubled down, some sold during the sell-off.

Thursday, PRPL announces earnings and either the stock moons or ROPE moons.

Legend has it that WSB owns like 90% of PRPL now that a batallion of tards joined in, but it is still unclear if PRPL has MEMEd yet or not

EDIT: Thursday, not Tuesday, looks like TW is deceiving meThats fucking radDoor guy at club. We had $3 vouchers for entry in the form of cards. End of shift, 3000 drunk people drop hundreds of cards everywhere. Each card I pick up is $3 I can take from the register. Numbers always spot on, boss says I do good work. Promoter sees higher volume, boss likes promoter more. Tell promoter I am funneling cards to boost their numbers, the give me weed. It's like magic.Nah I need that shit by Purple‚Äôs earning report if not $ROPERofl.... 4 year commitment to the US army for a Tesla.

Dude, people here are stupid, the level of idiocy you're suggesting... Fuck I'd rather Yolo my life savings on a 0dte.Or just  be a cashier at Costco.You are god damned dedicated here, and i cant believe i just read this entire comment chain and replies time to go outsideAah ok, gotcha! Makes much more sense now :) I was looking at it like investing and pulling my hair trying to make sense of this. Thanks for explainingOk, sorry mate to bother again, so we are all day traders on here then? Just reading up some stuff...thanks to WSB, my weekend is gonna fly by lol never a dull moment with Reddit aye ;)I mean I fucked up and threw a lot at it when it was going to 27, not quite at 27 - I sold some of that off and bought in at the dip yesterday for 22.5 Sept calls; currently 55 contracts deep from 73 contracts. 

PRPL is my entire portfolio now as well as my way of life and religion.

EDIT: Even though it went down to 23.6X yesterday, my Sept calls have done nothing but increase in value (this should have been the entire play; wait for it to go sub $24, then buy in on ITM calls).

In short made a big baller play too soon - but I expect to break even on that, maybe a BIT of profit - but a lot of profit on the calls I should have bought at the dip.

EDIT2: Spelling.

EDIT3: For clarification - I threw 16k at PRPL. No regrets.Should I shill SPCE instead?If you need $rope we can provide that. Its already hung up even. Where else are you going to find a 40ft climbing tower pre hung with military quality $rope. If you "accidentally" die your spouse or parent can collect on your GI insurance. You might be worth more with our US Army brand $rope. I can even sign you up for Airborne, who wants $rope when you can have a canopy malfunction.Jesus H Christ! You're going to be a god damned General! You might be the finest recruit material I have ever seen! Have you ever considered officer candidates school. 80% of the military is acronyms and you've got that down pat already.Hmmm when was the last time you heard a big tittied stripper say. Oh boy look at that fine ass hard man in his Costco Uniform? Ooowee I bet he got that medal for bravely bagging extra large boxes of tendies. Never that's fucking when. Now I'll admit some of you autistic fuckers are plain lucky or forged your own way through the hellish tall grass of the market solo. But some of you ain't gonna make it. Behind every ticker there's a trained ass killer waiting to sell you puts or leave you holding a big bag of get-wrecked.Depends on what's going on everyone doing their own thing not much day trading because we need over 25k to day trade properlyAah ok, thought Robinhood did let you do 3 day trades in a 5 day period.YesThanks for clearing that up for me :)But only 3! If you have 25k in your account, then you can buy/sell/buy/sell all day long if you wanted to.Thanks for clarifying that, idk though, the whole prospect seems a lot riskier now that I woke up in the AM vs super exciting and feeling that I will a good chunk of money last night lolWtf why is your robinhood app green?That's not how we do it hereHey, how come you don‚Äôt call me anymore???When did you sell? 

You must have called the top at 11am‚Äî I bought at 10am and was up 2-300 percent within 30 mins. Held through what I thought was a dip and rode all the way back down to a 20 percent loss. Sucks‚Äîhad fomo from that FB 20 bagger yesterday if you rode it all day.

Edit: my entry and exit/ https://imgur.com/a/QwWVQIFDad?Good fucking job.  I went small and made around 10k

Fucked up on my baba puts.  If I had held for 20 more minutes ot would have been 5k

Reply STOP to cancel txt msgsFor the love of god please take some chips off the table before your autistic ass loses everythingWhy did it run up so high? I honestly didn't see shit about Facebook anywhereCongrats and fuck youAre you accepting applications for a new hot goth gf? Like me?One of the things I appreciate about WeBull over RH is being able to buy 0days, which I did on FB 8/7's today and pretty conservatively scalped a similar percentage gain despite getting out of it when FB was around 273-274. Would've been more like 600-700% gain if I hadn't paper handsed it, but I was about to be busy with something and it was starting to stagnate, so had to take the sure gains.

I think max gains on the 0days on the way up was maybe 1300-1500% and then probably on the way down another 1300-1500%. Despite the massive day yesterday, the premiums on the FB options were still pretty low!Let us see your all time. Congrats and ______Talk about a green dildo... congrats. Oh, and fuck youwheres the part of the graph where it goes down. your app is bugged.I bought puts near the top, congrats.What inspired you to buy at that moment?STONKS ONLY GO UPHOT DAMNLol I bought a $300 call on Thursday for .47 cents. I plan to hold it till it‚Äôs in the money or worthlessHow did you anticipate the runup?Look at big dick here with his 3 Kodak putshow do I still feel bad despite having 10% of my portfolio in fb stocks?

I should just get out of stocks and only use calls, I would've been up there with youWas it otm when you bought?This looks amazing, I know not every trade looks like this but where do I start? How do I get involved in these earnings?Kodak PUT ?
You‚Äôre a real gentlemandad?Love to see FD's come out positive. Great work man.You‚Äôre doing it wrong!!DaddyWhat's the 'live' link to the left of 1 day?

Need help.Mods should permaban this madman!what do you mean????NEW PHONE WHO DIS?!I bought 78 280 calls yesterday and sold at at 278 in the morning. Glad I did because it went down drastically later. Also bought another 200 300calls in late afternoon and see if the streak goes on next week.Also got in this morning and sold right at 10:58 .

Pretty much the same haha.I got away with my 15 puts earlier this week so I thought I could get away once more lol.For every post like this, there are ten-thousand dudes who lost that amount. If you think asking that question here is gonna get you a chart like that, you deserve what you get.Jealousy is an ugly color.I can fix the green issue in a few hours if you need assistance. Honestly, maybe a few minutes if I play my cards rightI gotchu fam, PRPL 8/21 $35 c should fix your color scheme bug.Your baby mama...üòò

Congrats dude!  Next time let us know! LolDaddy?Hey man, can you be more specific? I had the same position and sold at 12  (my cost basis was about 6, so nice double up there). 

If you sold at 278, that was pretty much the top and this option was around 14 then, so wouldn‚Äôt 78 contracts be more like $100k?

Not doubting just trying to understand

Edit: I had the September strike, I‚Äôm assuming you had an August now. Got itWell done.was that a short squeeze or something? what caused it to gap up so high?i want to see the big increase and fall. In otherwords: me need big red chart to feel gudLucky bastard‚Äî you called the very top tick.Congrats on the tendies! Did you re-enter later in the day?was this a short squeeze? How did it gap up so high?Well‚Äî I regularly hit 1-200 pct on intra day trades (look at my post history), so while you might think locking in profits at 300 pct is obvious, I am not nearly as inspired by those gains. Plus, FB fired all day yesterday ...every single dip was bought and it climbed higher the entire day. 

I would rather be filled with regret I didn‚Äôt lock in a 10k gain and lost money (which is my result), versus regretting locking in a 10k profit that ran more and become 100k. Food for thought.Strong open. I was comparing it to the NASDAQ on a minute chart and noticed it was extremely bullish compared to the index. Following each tick it seemed to be making higher highs compared to the market overall and higher lows too. ADX was almost 40 which was my first signal there was a strong trend forming (ADX is just time series data and a complicated moving average). Also, R% and CCI% confirmed it was overbought (stocks tends to stay overbought for an extended period of time). I was basically just buying into strength ...riding a trend that was forming.Sister?Were you trading 0 DTE options to ride it like that? or big size? or both like a true WSBI'm honestly not a fan of RH or WeBull on charts. I'm usually looking shit up on Yahoo for that. I'm sure a real broker has nifty charts but I've only tried RH and WeBull so far. That said, WeBull is a bit better than RH on that. But they for some reason make it hard to see how much an option has gone up or down in a day, and it's not even that straightforward to simply see your P/L for the day. I think they do it to mainly encourage buying and holding stock vs. buying options or daytrading stock, but it's annoying.Purple is a good color although I only see redNot jealous just telling the truthHello yes pleaseGive me 30 seconds I'll take care of the green color.I entered at .68 and got out at 6.90. Those were 8/14 calls by the way. Yours were probably 8/7. Congrats on the 100% gains.Yea super lucky.  Just posted a screen shot of positions.Thanks!  No, just rode it in and out for a quick day tradeDon't think so.  A little birdie told me it would go up to 280You can lock in your profits and buy back in. You can sell a part of your position and let the "free contracts" ride. I respect your opinion but I'd rather lock in those profits and let the rest ride (if I'm debating tp or not obviously). 

And again, you can alwaaaays get back in unless you ran out of bp or something. I prefer hitting those 100-200% consistent plays rather than looking for home runs and losing all the profits just bc I got greedy. And tbh I've done that same thing too a bunch of times just bc I get FOMO. Means I gotta get better at following my rulesIf you don‚Äôt mind clarifying something for me..

I‚Äôve recently started using Barchart to track stocks similar to what you just described.. except until now I‚Äôve just been mentally watch what I thought looked like a strong breakout vs QQQ.

What indicators would you load into barchart and in what order do you ‚Äúrank‚Äù them when doing something like that?Will you be my friend hahaThat‚Äôs the point of RSI you know.I wish I could have an answer to that. I'm actually reading about 0 DTE because I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm still learning on the go and just got lucky with my yolo calls.Silver is the new redPhenomenal, well done man!

Cash gang now?
After selling the (almost) peak today I somehow timed the bottom and re-entered at 7.5.How long does it take for you to sell them? Usually I find that when it comes time to close my position there's no buyers.analyst network? or just inside to the big bois?

(or just retards on wsb?)

I'm curious what category this pump and dump arrived on, not necessarily the actual thing it arrrived onExplaining my rationale in the moment but agree with your comments. It was a lesson that cost me 10k in tuition and trying to learn something from it. Normally, I would trail stop at large increments of 100-200 pct gains (30 percent trail of mark), or sell half at 100 pct and let the rest ride or die, as you pointed out.

Let this one get the best of me.RSI is relative to recent price levels of the ticker itself... not the market overall‚Äîit‚Äôs an overbought/oversold indicator only.0 days until expiry - basically options with really high delta to offer a lot of leverage. a true gamble. but if you dont know what that means shit man dont fix whats not broken. yolo.YessirThanks! I'll probably put 6k in my roth and think of how to deal with the rest later. I also re-entered 300c 8/14 @.74. Do you think it'll keep going up next week?A network I am in yea.  Old timer who is really smart on calling stock levels and momentum, he had said money was ready again to flow into FB a few days ago.  He almost always trades in levels and had seen FB trigger a reverse off his level and had strong momentum breaking through all ceilings yesterday.  He said if it broke 273 today, it would make its way up to the next level around 280.  So i got in after it broke that and rode it to the top once it started losing steam around 10:56, so i got out two minutes later.  The guy is right like 90% of the time and sometimes to the penny.  Fucking nuts...Those losses are the best lessons. I've taken a lot of those! Lol. Made me realize that trading is a lot more about controlling your emotions than I thought it was at first. Anyways hope you make that back soon, keep getting those tendiesüí™üèºThis is the community I am here for.With Facebook (and so many) you never know. That‚Äôs why I bought Sept. 

I don‚Äôt know how long you‚Äôve been doing Options but I‚Äôve settled on a strategy of buying 1-2 months out. The gains are steady (tripled account in a month) but I rarely get to make posts like yours of 1,000 percent gains.If you can‚Äôt figure out what to do with the rest, you can send me some. GODDAMN!Any advice for identifying or getting into these networks? I saw a surge of them using signal and discord back when the cr(y)pto stuff was big back in 2015-2016, but I never really saw any decent ones in the equities/options space, just a whole lot of noise and ponzi schemes shilling their referrals to webull or robinhood.

I guess I'm assuming that they're public, but now that I think about it, I'm guessing they're privateI'm very new to options. Started 4 days ago actually. After I heard the FB releasing Reels on Instagram news, I sold my other positions and went all in. Totally did not expect this much gains.

I will absolutely take your advice for my next buys. My luck will run out eventually.My student loans calling lmaoThe one I am in is a paid monthly service that allows for backtesting and sharing information with eachother.  It has an amazing community of nice well to do traders who help eachother and is super strict on what you share and the context of the community to keep non trade related things and bullshit out.  Having to pay also helps that as well.  Everywhere else i have seen are giangantic piles of shit and money making schemes.This is the best first week of options trading scenario I‚Äôve ever seenLol JFC you're going to learn the hard way don't buy so far out the money with short expiration. This win today was 1690% luckAs they say, the first one is free!

Sent you a DM. Good luck out there!Don‚Äôt remind me lolyea lol, gigantic piles of dog shit wrapped in cat shitCould you pm me the info for getting into this group?You're absolutely right. I got in over my head.*ya totally don't do this, I would never*My first one definitely cost money

And my second, third, fourth...don't listen to them, do youHaha same here. Then my 4th I made 300%!! Then promptly lost it all holding through QE. Lesson learned!Sir, this is the unemployment line.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*Very inspiring and exactly what this sub needs to hearokay but 2000 and 2008 were just buying opportunities for the majority of people that didn't lose their jobs, and anyone who bought the dip made a killing. likewise, anyone who just bought indices in march is up like 50%.

WSB is a casino, and people should really not be participating with their retirement money.Let‚Äôs fucking go. The motivation I need after a red day. I   Looked at my 401k it was trash, your so called Advisor if you even have one is doing nothing but taking money and maybe you just self select a target date plan that gives you terrible returns. Better to live and die by your own hand in the market. Whether you‚Äôre option yolo, digital assets guy, or just simply choosing your own stocks based off of questionable DD at least you know it was you who did it. Let‚Äôs fucking go.Wow the first quality post since MarchFuck yeah feller keep at er and let‚Äôs see that sweet sweet gain pornThis guy works for Edward Jones.Same generation here. 00s crash, Great Recession , now this stuff. Get yours. Be smart. The calculus has changed. 

Thanks man!Some good wisdom here. I stopped playing weeklies and monthlies some time ago. Leaps helped me build some proper money that doesn‚Äôt disappear after a month.Why lose 50% over the next 10 yrs rather than 50% in an hour and another 50% over 10 yrs ü§îWhat did you eat just before writing thisThis is a joke right?

backrest over any multidecade span in the past 70 years including crashes handily disproves you. Also 95% of day traders fail (to say nothing of options traders lmao), why the fuck would some guy on robinhood expect to be able to squeeze arbitrage out of a market being run by vampires and AIs

Don't forget this sub is a circlejerk peopleThis is what I tell my older friends... this generation has nothing to look forward to... might as well yolo the fuck out of it and try to break the cycleThe s&p is up almost 50% since March.  Easy to be a brilliant investor (gambler) in this market.  Robinhood is selling your trade order flow to rich old jerks who make bank whether you succeed or fail.>An Ally savings account and a shit job the boss is trying his damnedest to offshore ain‚Äôt gonna get you there

So what am I supposed to do now thenThis is the most autistic shit I‚Äôve ever read on this sub.Respectfully, this post just isn‚Äôt right on some key facts. The worst 10 year return for the SP500 is very slightly negative. The worst 20 year return is +6.4% per year. Think about that. You pick the worst starting year in history, and 20 years later you‚Äôve got 3.5x what you started with. Saving for retirement is a 30+ year time horizon. So Bogle‚Äôs personal finance advice is fine. It really has been idiotproof for anyone that stuck close enough too it and avoided all the snake oil Wall Street and other grifters tried to sell along the way. 

I‚Äôd be the first to admit this economy doesn‚Äôt work fairly for everyone, but trading options is not a panacea...it‚Äôs a strategy that by definition has a looser for every winner. Whether that‚Äôs short dated or leaps, single leg or spreads. Options are a zero sum game and I promise you retail investors are not making money on options in aggregate. 

Good luck with your trading, but it‚Äôs important to keep some perspective. Cheap, diversified equity investing is the one game that is not zero sum. And that‚Äôs why over the long term the probability of success has been 100%.Really great post and great advice. This should make the front pageI feel motivatedNo god damnit, I fucking love you. That was the most motivating something fuck or another I‚Äôve read or felt in a long time. Thank you.It‚Äôs Bogle not boggleüòÇMan...  GenX also and this all hits home.  Boomers trying to force us into a shit sandwich they‚Äôve created and it‚Äôs backfiring on them in spectacular fashion with one financial crisis after another.  The younger generation blames the boomers for not getting out of the way by not retiring, but imagine living your whole life on the blind faith that your 401k will be there when you do retire but it‚Äôs not...  imagine having no choice but to keep working until the day you die...Why am I erect??So by neutral you're saying that you traded iron condors and spreads. Thats exactly what I did with DIS this week and made 25 percent.but dave ramsegay told me to keep 6mo expenses in a cash emergency fund, spend decades accumulating saving in my 4-fund 401k/IRAs, and pay off my house so that when i get cancer i can go bankrupt from med bills and lose it all in 1 yearLove it, thanks for all the insight!I skimmed through it but I saw yolo it on MU FDs. Check.I'll suggest another way that the new generation should invest: Leverage

Read this book from two Yale economics professors about using leverage in your youth to ACTUALLY LOWER YOUR RISK.

That's right, you young bucks. Borrow and put it in the market.

But don't be an chump and just yolo. Learn, grow, dominate.Man, this post gave me goosebumps. It's as if I'm reading something I wrote myself after a similar realization except being more eloquently written. Thanks for this and I hope more folks in our age group (GenX'r myself) realizes this lucky situation to which the Millennials and GenZ'rs have found themselves into.Bro a THIRD tower fell (in freefall i might add) on September 11th.

This is 100% the opposite to what you are saying. Hope you see this and we can get a discussion going. ‚ù§This is the best post on this subreddit. Fucking THANK YOU. I've been trying to say this forever. The calculus has changed, baby. Get fucked, boomers.This system that you hate are unfortunately molded by the old guards, so if you want the best benefits (I.e long term capital gains tax), you have no choice but to not frequent trade and hold long term since it racks up short term capital gains.Totally disagree. I was invested during the dot-com crash, the Great Recession and now COVID-19. I retired two years at 38 a multimillionaire. I didn't YOLO, I just studied hard, got into the best in-state public colleges I could get into, got a good career and then steadily saved my paychecks in a low-cost of living state with no state income tax for years, then did the majority of my stonk buying in 2002 and 2010 as we pulled out of the bottoms. This year, I've been steadily buying big oil, big banks and big tech since April and expect those pay off handsomely in the next 5-10 years, too.

The only reason why you folks complain about buy-and-hold being a scam is because you lack discipline and patience. To stick with an investment plan during a 10-year market cycle takes a ton of both and since most of you are in your 20s or 30s, you don't have the life experience to pull it off. You need to  have the fortitude and self-confidence to not buy a thing as the market is setting new highs and to then turn around and throw six-digits of your hard earned cash at the market when it's crashing 33% in a month.

If you YOLO and make a life changing amount of money, I'm legit happy for you. But it just means you hit on a lottery ticket. People who buy lottery tickets tend to be desperate losers, both IRL and on WSB.Dude it sounds like u didn‚Äôt put away enough for ur retirements. My boomer parents r rocking it with their 401k, IRA, and pension plans. They never took anything out and the exponential growth in their accounts in last 6 years have been nuts. It‚Äôs mind boggling. It is unrealistic to expect that kind of gains here and on but time in the market truly triumphs over everything imo. If we look at 20-30 years down the horizon, u cant go wrong consistently putting money in the market (even put in more in bear markets as buffett & ben grahm advocate: welcome and cherish bear markets).Preach it brothaI love youWell fuck my retard brain found this wholesomeDino park tycoon > oregon trail. Both still better than math blasters that shit was terribleSalute. I keep getting stars in my eyes but I'll make sure to not blow out my current wheel on TQQQ since that's what's paying for my rent and disposable expenses. I won't bet it on black with everything I've got.. just some that I've got.Diversified portfolio eliminates firm-specific risk, not market risk.Geezus! That was fucking gold, man. Pin this to the mf'n top. Hell, make it required reading for WSB like your broker does with Characterstics and Risks of Standardized Options. I use a similar approach of charting small, quick momentum plays scalping high volume/high open interest ATM weeklies. Ain't no yolo, but it's become consistent gains that have added up to tangible reward that's supplemental to my day job (I'm an expat working multiple time zones away from NYC, so it's an at-night thingy a couple of times a week). But my man, that story is why I come here. Fuck yeah.Wouldn‚Äôt boggleheads recommend having like 6-12 months of cash so you can survive term economic misfortune? Just saying.I try and max out my 401k each year for the 7% YOY, but I also have some money for more speculative plays and "home run" swings.  I think there's room for both but make sure you're setting some money aside  as a safety net.  Like the people who try and go pro in sports, you better have a backup plan just in case.Damn bro, does your wife's boyfriend need a new mustang or some shit?

You're genuinely so retarded yet so confident in yourself that it's astonishing.

If this sub wants to take a 80% chance at losing money just for some short term gains, whatever, it's their money. But acting like you'll have better returns in the long term over consistent investing in funds in the majority of cases is just plain delusional. Of course it doesn't work if you keep taking money out of the market, but at least you'll still have that money to take out, unlike with chasing options.This is the only long post I read on this fucking sub since joining last year and it turned me gay! spy 300p 8/10Lol you didn‚Äôt even do the basics right. Of course you had to draw on your investments. You didn‚Äôt have an emergency fund in place. You‚Äôre giving advice when you were unsuccessful and painting the picture like you did everything right. You didn‚Äôt. You failed to even follow basic personal finance rules. Lol. Terrible advice.Best pep talk I heard this week.DeepThanks for sharing brotherWILL YOU BE MY MOMWell said.  In fact it's so good I copied and put it into notepad, so I can read it again tomorrow.  Same generation.  Thanks for the face smack.  I need it.So yolo weeklies ? Or whatPOST OF THE YEAR.Absolute agree - the age of no commission trades has made it easier to enter and exit trades without having to factor in the addition transaction fees of ye olden times.  And without that pesky worry it lowered the barrier for retail investors to jump into trading.  

When times change you have to adapt to it or be left behind.  Which is why now I've started to trade a sizable portion of my portfolio on momentum trends and once my target price has been reached I cash out.  And if a certain play isn't working out I don't "dollar cost average", I just get out and go on to the next play.  I have also noticed lately it's been relatively simple to pick up gains of 100% in an extremely short amount of time ( ie. 2 months to 1 day ), and no matter what the talking heads say there is always a play out there even on red days.  Actually the red days are great days to look for beaten down stocks to pick up for a quick turn around since most people are probably thinking the same thing.  

I just want to say, thanks for this post.  And best of luck to everyone.  Don't worry if there are more red days, that means that there are opportunities to pick off gains when that stock you picked up on a red day goes green.It's post like these that make wading through the shitposts on here worth it. Thank you OPThank you for writing this beautiful thing. I can't possibly ever describe to you how much I enjoyed reading it.Been on Reddit about 3-4 years, bought my first coins and gave my first award today.

Robinhood is getting desperate, hiring English majors to write *Hardy Joe bag of doughnut* gain porn stories. For a minute I thought I was in a MLM Facebook group. Save the marketing expense, we are already hooked.AmenI'm surprised this doesn't have more upvotes. I'm a millennial and have the same perspective. People spend their entire youth working their ass off on something they dislike and hoping for that ideal life, that ideal vacation, house and kids only to live their dreams through their kids. What use is that money in old age when we have all the $$$ and time but no energy and health! Technology has provided great opportunities to the younger generation. We see 20yr old millionaires who run their own online business while traveling the world. Wall Street shits on Robinhood because they have disrupted the fintech world. They're jealous of the rookies making money. In the end, it's a 50/50 shot of making it. 100k in overstock in March is worth $2.5 mil. Imagine being able to retire in 3 months instead of 30 years!

Tom Sosnoff from tastytrade made a good comment about the Robinhood era. As you said, if you're gonna make or lose money in the next 10 years, you might as well do it in the next 10 hours (but prepare for the worst). Yolo!Most real shit I‚Äôve ever read on WSBOP is the father I never hadYea I‚Äôm probably the same age as you.  I have been putting away about 10% of my pay on average into the markets since I started working full time in 2007.   How have you not made money in the markets even with down periods??   The hell are you buying?    My 401k was allocated about 80% s&p and 20% short term bonds.  Every time the market dropped a lot, i took the bonds and added it to the s&p.  Rinse and repeat.  Been doing quite well.   

Now for my own personal trading, yea its a casino and a lot of fun.  Definitely didn‚Äôt do as a good as my long-term 401k boring account that I rarely make moves on.   Hit a big win streak, then lose it on a few dumb trades a week later.    But yea...keeping a process that has proven to work is key here.   0 dte plays are straight gambling fun.

Since we are young and have the benefit of time....It is very hard to not make money over the long-term.  Time is the key.  Compounded rates of return over the long term.   

If you are just really lamenting on the job markets or the economy, thats a completely different story.This sub is trash for actual financial planning it's just gambling. Investing in a zero fee index fund is actually what you should do.. but you call that trash lolPositions or ban. Great write up though retard.Great post, a version of my thoughts on the matter.

Related, during JPow's testimony to Congress in early June, Dems kept grandstanding on racial issues and pressed him on how a rising stock market increases inequality and hurts black people.

And yet, go on Twitter click on cashtags and tell me it's not an incredibly 'diverse' group of people- young people, people of color, etc.- who are trading/investing right now. It's available to everyone to participate in, and benefit from.Reading your long ass post, I realized I'm pretty much the opposite of you but probably the same age. Never had money until later in life (after 30), bought a couple properties (one at the bottom of the GFC) and yet I also realized YOLO is stronger than my boring ETF Vanguard after discovering this sub. Like the Zurich Axioms teach, almost

That a new tesla model???Best thing I've read in a long time. I dig the punk rock ethos a lot and I completely agree that the game is just fundamentally different now. The old models don't work anymore, and it's time to adapt or GTFO, instead of moaning about the swarms of uneducated rogues with smartphones wreaking havoc on the market. I actually feel very bad for Cramer. His circuitry is probably so ossified by now that he may find it impossible to understand this perspective.

Just today I visited the Bogleheads forum to get a glimpse of what life is like in one of the more austere investment cults. Here are some fun facts that I picked up while I was there:

- Everything is always priced in. That's because everyone has perfect information all of the time, all investors have the exact same risk profiles, and every person on earth has the exact same set of personal preferences, thoughts, and feelings. Oh also, the number of investors in the world is **infinity**. These facts form the premise for the efficient market hypothesis. It seems weird, right? But it is very simple, so it is true.

- Because you are not smart and your opinions and intuitions are necessarily bad, the only reasonable approach to investing is to choose a one-size-fits all approach, without a doubt. You may have 30% of your portfolio tied up in VXUS for 7 years with no returns, but do NOT be tempted to rebalance! That would be ludicrous. Sure, you may miss out on *a few* years of wealth accumulation, but would you rather lose **every penny you own** by attempting to outsmart the smartest guys in the world (see EMH)? And how dare you question the people who penned this strategy? They would know *best*- they *invented* the funds you are buying.

- Investing in stocks is a **fools errand**. Nobody has ever made money trading stocks (again, EMH).

To be clear, I understand that passive investing works and is appropriate and desirable for a large number of people. The thing I take issue with is the relentless parroting of no-longer-relevant or just blatantly reductive trading tenets. Critical thinking is worth so much more these days than a perfect three-fund portfolio, IMHO.It is very easy to make some money to pay bills with 5000-10000 in an account. You won‚Äôt get rich but you can easily get by.The zeitgest of the Oregon Trail generation.  Fuck starting as the banker and taking the long road.

If you have the means and time, derivatives open things up so much more than buy and hold bullcrap. Think of those that have lost everything in March when they were force to sold to save their home.

I'm not saying you should attempt to day trade weeklies (which is what I've been trying to do since March with modest success), but the leverage from buying say... a single AAPL leap (and a real one a year+ out) will go so much further than tying up capital from 100 fucking shares.

No other time period will make this feasible. The 65 cents per contract fee is negligible at a decent broker.

I don't know when the party will end, but for now I'm riding this until I blow up my trading account.you can read?If you *owned* indices in March, you are back to where you started after a heart-stopping drop and a very unfunny meme called ‚Äúmoney printer go brrr‚Äù.

Recession\*A handful of addyNot true at all: we have catastrophic climate change coming right upget a better jobRevolutionThis argument is predicated on the idea that you will consistently have a job, that this job pays a wage that accommodates for significant saving, that your income will always increase over time, and that no major crises happen that require you to break this piggy bank. Life is rarely so smooth.

A lot of the negative responses I get in this thread concern my trials through the dot-com bust and the GFC, and are basically: you didn‚Äôt save enough! In both cases, the setbacks were so significant - medical, job loss and other - I was left with little choice but to raid the coffers, and those had already been raided by AIG and the rest of the usual suspects.

You cannot bank on 20 years of order. It is, in fact, safer to bank on chaos.Hes looking at the market with his beer gogles.This is what I always thought since they were saying the SS fund would be bankrupt before I could collect it. That was back when I was 16. I'm gonna be 38 next week.

I never had any illusions of retirement and fully expected to work until dead because the system is fucked and stacked against everyone that isn't at the top of close to it. I'm either going to learn how to make a fortune in this market or its over. It's either money you couldn't how to make if you worked your entire life, or death.

That is why so many people are in the market now. It's the only way working class people have any chance to make it, and even that game is rigged and most won't succeed.

https://youtu.be/jh86o76bFk8A lot of wide strangles, but yes, same underlying strategy. Occasionally I go directional on a stock that‚Äôs acted stupid in the past few days. But the biggest thing is not to put too much risk on one play.Ugh. Please don't discount old Dave. his advice is right for his audience - churchies and people who already fucked themselves over. If you're trying to get out of poverty, long term it's pretty solid advice tbh.

stay woke.I‚Äôm familiar with this guy. I think his only real mistake is the blind faith of guaranteed returns by saving into a volatile market.

Nevertheless, his primary angle is ‚Äúhow can I cover expenses without a wage?‚Äù I think this is the right place to start, and a lot of people don‚Äôt even get that far.I think the fear of short term capital gains tax is also part of the ‚ÄúNyah Nyah day traders lose money‚Äù type wall street telling mainstreeters to stay in their place narrative. So I shouldn‚Äôt even try because I have to pay 30% ? Fuck it I will make 3x my originial goal and you can have your 30%.Short term capital gains is still better than Earned Income: no FICA.

You are right, the tax regime is skewed against the little guy. But it‚Äôs still a good problem to have, and there are clever and legal ways to minimize the impact.I hate people comparing WSB to the actual lottery. At least WSB allows me to leverage my education and research towards skewing the odds in my favor a little via some good DD, whereas the lottery legit has like 1 in 14 million odds of winning.

That's like saying betting on blackjack or poker is the same as playing slots. Sure there's still a lot up to chance in both, but at least the former is an acquired skill that can be honed.Nice humble-brag assholeCombination of your approach and the OP's approach is imo best for people who enjoy playing markets. To be really successful one needs to develop short term and long term perspective which is not easy at all. Also the ratios of assets under each perspective(long term/short term) can differ based on risk exposure one is comfortable with.
There are different set of classes I see based on situation person is in:

1) Someone unemployed who has basic needs and support but little money he wants to use for investments. This person can only work theoretically on the long term vision but to make money you are forced to take short term bets with good risk management(ideally 1-5% loss per trade)

2) Someone who is employed, doesnt have any crazy debt, has lower middleclass paycheck and is able to save up. Job is stable for longer term(3-5 years). The asset management here is already more interesting. Based on the market view one can divide percentage wise into a)Diversified product(ETF, set of indicies,whatever), b)Cash, c)Active trading. Or some type of hybrid like theta gang where you dont mind owning stock for longer period of time. I dont see problem with actively managing a) and c) together but buying call options should be a tiny portion of your investment grade cash.

3) From here its individuals who make good money and have higher savings and same applies as in case of 2) but with more freedom. Fancy some property investment? Here you can consider it. Changing job to pursue what you really like to do? Can be done comfortably. 

4) Once you build wealth it not so difficult to operate however you want. If you pursue finance out of interest and not purely for material reasons, you have ways to make impact and money which derives meaning for your life.Holy shot I forgot shot Dino park tycoon!Fon't kid yourself, you've been a gay queer for a long time.They‚Äôre the last slice of GenX, possibly an Xennial, so my guess is early 40sAs of today at 3:59 EDT, they are 0. :)Couldn‚Äôt say it any betterHow do you mean shift? Back to crash because of runaway infection?You know, you are probably onto something. They might make qualifying to trade options in your brokerage account much harder.You got downvoted, but I don‚Äôt think your dissent is unwarranted.

I don‚Äôt believe day trading is ‚Äúthe answer‚Äù, but I do believe chasing the mythical 7% working a job you hate for 30 years is not. 

To thrive in the new economy means thinking outside of the box, taking risks and learning from mistakes. That can mean any number of things. I believe trading equities are one of those things, that the barrier of entry is small and the possibility of profit is very real for those who put in the effort."Self-deluded Doomer?" 

Yeah you can go fuck right offI honestly still dont know what this bot does"after losing 10 grand doing dumb bullshit, it's very helpful for someone to tell me that was actually a smart decision"

if you read the actual post, he's not even talking about buying LEAPS, he's talking about weeklies/monthlies on stupid companies like PRPL.What broker do you use? Does it have a good mobile interface? I trade at work, so mobile is a necessityIf the market didn't rebound after March, day trading would not have been the answer either because we would have been in for a societal shakeup. If you haven't had a job since 2008, day trading sure as hell isn't the answer either.

Participation dropped  from about 66% to about 63% since 2008, or about a 5% decline. So yeah I guess what I said only applies to 95% of people.Contribute 20%, it adds up real fast.I just do 10% and company match because my job lets me buy 25% stock with it and has a 4.24% matchShkreli 2.0Thanks!Sell your body on the street corner for capital, like the rest of us...dude now you're just being ridiculous. what you're saying is statistically untrue. you're on an endorphin rush from doubling your account or something, and you're trying to make it sound like some profound sage advice for everyone to throw away their steady saving plan. if you worked in tech 20 years ago and actually did have to raid your retirement due to a layoff, you probably DID have an issue with spending/saving. suggesting everyone be rolling the dice with a 25% chance of boosting their retirement plans and 75% chance of going absolutely fucking broke is just plain retarded.But my argument isn‚Äôt predicated on any of that. Costly life events will hit a floundering options trader just as hard as a long term investor. But the average long term investor will have more money to deal with them.> require you to break this piggy bank

This is the part I keep disagreeing with you on, over and over throughout this thread. 

You posit this perfect storm of the market taking a dive *and* you having such dire troubles that you have to wipe out your retirement account just to continue living. In return, I say you didn't understand the advice you were given and you fucked yourself.

Your retirement account isn't your piggy bank. A plain ole savings account is supposed to be your piggy bank. When the market dives, your retirement account sits there and then rides it back up when it recovers. Can you deny that if you'd never raided it you'd be up a ton right now? 

You were supposed to have a savings account separate from your investments. That was also part of the advice. You park a few months' expenses in a money market account and then start investing after that is squared away. And if it gets so bad you have to lose your house? Then lose your fucking house. Your house wasn't your retirement plan, your 401k was. The whole fucking point of investing, as you are describing it, is that *you don't take it out.* All you do is slowly rebalance as you approach retirement age. That's it.Yep I‚Äôm a broke college kid and trade spreads worth around 70 or less. Make about 25-30 bucks and close and do it again.The last sentence is what people really miss around here.

Like. 

Doesn‚Äôt anyone remember where YOLO came from? A bunch of idiot‚Äôs in my age group yelling it before they risked their life for little upside benefit circa 2009 on YouTube. 

The way people play around here is insanity.If you have the discipline to take profits, and cut your losses, and diversify your bets never putting too much money in one thing, you are already way ahead of the game.His advice is great for people who've gotten fucked on consumer debt, but I will never recommend a person learning personal finance to take Dave's advice. 

He hates credit cards, and understandably, because everyone that watches his show has maxed out their 8 credit cards. 

Should never use your debit card for things like hotels, shopping ect. You should go buy what you need with a credit card and pay it off right away. 

It's almost like his whole show is based around the idea that people can't stop swiping a credit card or pay the bill, so he makes them use cash.a plane crashing into a building can. 

for the record i still think bush did itBut you are the one who will take more risk while they have their guaranteed 30% return, so you still get the short end of the stick.Bullshit. There is zero skill involved in reading a bunch of posts about meme stocks and then randomly buying puts or calls on PRPL or SPCE or NKLA on a hope and a prayer with no plan whatsoever at impossible odds.  That is exactly what a lottery ticket it. Just because you are leveraging your "education and research" doesn't mean everyone else has the slightest clue as to wtf is going on.You‚Äôre kind of the embodiment of so many things that are currently wrong and why we have so many whoa is me, system is rigged, bail me out of my shitty decisions whiners.  You have someone disagree with the original post - and there is a ton to disagree with (and some to agree with) - give some thoughtful insight into what they have done that has lead to success and since it doesn‚Äôt fit what you believe or fit some narrative you hope is right - he‚Äôs bragging and an asshole.  

Grow up and educate yourself - the first way to do that is listening to multiple thoughts, systems, processes, etc.Quick question: 1985 is Gen X right? I keep hearing I‚Äôm the last of the millennials and idk shit any moreCash is a positionif u havent noticed there was the biggest bull run of the history of the stock market from April to July!! Now SP500 has regained pre covid level, easy mode over. Now stocks will actually go up and down.It‚Äôs saying the OP is very long like the current unemployment lineI thought it meant... like sir please don‚Äôt tell us your life story. Get your welfare and move along?I didn't say what I did was a smart decision. Realizing a 10k loss in a day trade never is a smart move.

I get what OP Is saying, but what I'm advocating for is using options on more conservative bet to consistently build up your actual portfolio (esp if you have less capital available) and at a more accelerated pace.

I don't do retarded bullshit on my long-term accounts. Rarely ever in my "mid-term" account. I keep it to my trading account.

We will have a period of flat/slow market growth eventually (maybe?), but the volatility hasn't ended yet as we are in unprecedented time.I day trade daily so I'm not using mobile and have a desktop client setup. While everyone's preference is RH, I see no reason not to pay the contract fee for better execution/fill as for bigger ticket options the bid/ask spread can easily justify the expense.

You won't get the same mobile experience on Fidelity, TD, IB etc. but again those things above matter to me.And I do hope people realize the societal shakeup is still on the table with all the mortgages people can't pay.That 5% decline is millions of people who were never able to reenter the workforce. 

I‚Äôm not saying ‚Äúday trading‚Äù is the answer. I‚Äôm saying the myth of the stable job and 7% returns in the market without ever having to break the piggy bank is a fantasy, and finding ways around that is paramount.Yeah I was contributing 15%, company put in like 8.5%, and my Roth 401k is at like $25k now. This is in a hcol area too.Once my market gains are more consistent I‚Äôm going to start participating in the company stock purchase program, 15% discount each time I buy.  Problem is my wages aren‚Äôt enough to where I have that freedom, hence needing those market gains to be more steady to supplement that income.Doesnt work in the age of covid.I think you are missing my point.

From my experience, saving money in the market, for our generation, is a sucker‚Äôs game. Volatility since the Nixon Shock has only ever gotten worse, and the most likely time you may need to access that money in an emergency is during one of the ever more violent downswings. 

Backtesting does not account for getting hit by an uninsured motorist, or hitting the deductible on the shitty HSA plan that‚Äôs all you can afford. It doesn‚Äôt account for going unemployed for months, only being able to land a job that pays half as much for the next two years. It doesn‚Äôt check if you are competing against foreigners on special visas who get paid half again of that.

The controversy is that I think the concept of a ‚Äúretirement plan‚Äù is a joke, because job stability and market stability is a joke. Relying on a 401k plan to be there when you need it is a risk itself. Shit, look at all the old people still working after the GFC - and those guys had *pensions.*

I believe rather than keeping your head down and grinding away for decades, handing 10-20% over to Mr. Market to manage for you in some passive way, should be figuring out how to pay your expenses using that money right now.

My grandfather‚Äôs generation made a deal after the Great Depression to take a 12% tax for their ‚Äúretirement plan.‚Äù They‚Äôve seen a 1% return on that in aggregate, and minorities statistically have taken a loss. They‚Äôd have been better off just buying Treasuries. But as bad as that deal is, the deal we are getting is worse. Our whole future is being banked on the whims of an increasingly capricious market. 

If watching every single asset price fall this last March, including gold, didn‚Äôt alarm you and you still think ‚Äúpast performance guarantees future results‚Äù, I don‚Äôt know what else to say. I hope for your sake I‚Äôm wrong.% gains is all that mattersUsername checks out.I completely agree. That last line you wrote is 100% accurate. His target audience are people lacking self discipline and he's helping by setting clear boundaries for them - literally a step by step plan for not fucking yourself over.And I wasn't born to wealthy parents either, so fucking what? The playing field will never be level. Go and get yours without regard for the fact that it isn't as much as Theirs.Well one other thing the old guard isn‚Äôt telling everyone; ‚Äúwhy not sell covered calls on your long hold positions?‚Äù

No, instead they create this fractional share bullshit to even further remove the plebs from properly leveraging the market.  Makes me sick...70% of profit is still profitIt‚Äôs fuzzy and different people will tell you different things, but I feel the border is a very fuzzy 1982 +/- 2 or 3 years

I‚Äôd say you were a millennial, but you have very obvious X influences. You‚Äôre in the fuzzy region, I think. You remember a time before cell phones and computers as a necessity? Maybe used a typewriter once or twice in grade school?Yeah I want something better than RH, but I literally cannot have a desktop app. Oh wellYeah, particularly real estate in city centers is probably ready to shit the bed. No entertainment downtown for a year, tons of people out of jobs, and tons more working from home for good. It could crash bigly.and the 95% is the 150 million that had a job then and have a job now. get a decent income, buy index funds, and if you aren't a high earner get out of california, and you'll be fine.

if you make money from options, congratulations and don't forget to pay the 24% on your gains.

the labor force participation rate was at an ATH of 64% in 1980.You are wrong. It's not anyone else's fault you're a jaded Xer blaming the system because you were personally broke when a downtown hit. That's why you're supposed to save during prosperous times. Getting hit by an uninsured motorist is bad luck but it is far less likely than losing your shirt playing options.> Shit, look at all the old people still working after the GFC - and those guys had pensions.

Those aren't the same people. The people who invested are not working and if they were close to retirement then shouldn't have been heavily exposed to the stock market. The old people at work are the ones who never saved to begin with and who didn't have a pension. Do you really think every last job had a fucking pension? C'mon.Profit is profitWhen will there be a WSB Dave Ramsey like radio host, who helps people who cant stop buying FDs üòÇOr if you actually make good consistent money at this, move to Puerto Rico so you pay zero in capital gains tax.We had a phone in the kitchen with a 10ft coil cord until cordless came. Then my mom‚Äôs first cell phone I was 10 y/o.. you had to pull the antenna out on that bad boy. I was still recording radio mixes on a cassette lol then I was part of the original Napster revolution via my dial-up connection. Good times...And what was different in 1980? Was a single income enough to support a family in 1980?Yah but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be able to keep my shit together if in the face of natural disaster, POTUS just throws paper towels at me...i mean, maybe. purchasing power has remained about constant, so it seems things haven't changed that much aside from, again, the cost of living skyrocketing in a few spots in the country, which is mostly a function of increased population.

what you're saying is a narrative that i keep hearing from people that have had personal struggles in the last 10 years. your personal situation doesn't necessarily reflect the typical case. in the bigger picture, people are doing about as well as ever.The purchasing power of a dollar to buy beer and bread, sure.

But the rising costs of housing, education, and healthcare had FAR outstripped inflation. And no, wages haveI think it does, at least with me.  I‚Äôm not in an Uber wealthy area (north Texas suburbs) and am receiving an income around $130k a year.  After mortgage, food, etc... there‚Äôs little left over to do the things we want as a family.  Whether you want to admit it or not, a huge wedge is being driven deep into the middle class and the gap is about to get much wider.  This guy is making the point that the market serves as an income supplement to wages not keeping up with inflation which I‚Äôm all for and currently doing (swing trading options while performing my tasks for my day job) and it‚Äôs working out well.  I‚Äôve taken some of our Trump Bucks from a few mo the ago and have already tripled it now allowing my family a little financial breathing room.yeah, healthcare and education in the US are a scam. housing is historically pretty affordable with 3% interest on mortgages though.yeah that's cool. there are people on the opposite side of your trades losing just as much money, and you're paying a quarter of it back to the government, but i guess it's working out for you.

i make half of your income and save half of what i make. maybe the problem is spending. if you're paying 1000/month for food and 2000 for a mortgage, and saving a generous 2000 for retirement, that still leaves 2000-3000 for other stuff.It is absolutely spending. I guarantee that this guy and his family blow stupid money on shit that's overpriced or they don't need.I'm not saying 130k for a family is rich or anything, but it's always irritating to me when people that make very decent money say they're just barely able to scrape by and somehow try to blame boomers, when really their lifestyle has crept way up because they need a 3000 square foot house and a 70k SUV for their wife and her boyfriend and son.Like i know families that get total 40k a year and save a quarter of that.So trueGuys this is pretty hurtful TBH.  Yah the income is good but we live very frugally.  Mine and my wife‚Äôs cars are both paid for, we don‚Äôt go on wild spending sprees, our 3 kids don‚Äôt get extravagant things.  We live on a $200 per week grocery budget that is constantly blown out of the water due to spiking food prices.  We don‚Äôt take family vacations which is sad IMO...  we save every month for Christmas, emergency fund, etc which by this point is peanuts.   

Fuck you assholes for assuming I‚Äôm some financially wreckless idiot rolling around in $60k vehicles, blowing money on stupid shit.  Fuck you all...If you're in a high tax area, let's break down that 130k for a typical family.

- ~$39k in taxes off the top. [$91k left] This will vary by state, but unless you live in a state income tax free state, it'll be close to this. And if you do? They make it back in other usage taxes. So I'm sticking to this number for simplicity. I'm also not even mentioning municipal taxes on top like nyc has, because this math is completely fucked for those areas and you're underwater before we even start on 130k.
- Also, $10k off the top because even the most retarded autist if going to take advantage of a 401k if you're gambling in here. This could be as high as $19.5k, but also reduces your overall tax burden above, so I'm just going with $10k. Fuck with the math on this all you want. [$81k left].

Next!

- $2.5k / month on a mortgage OR rent. And this is fucking cheappp. You got kids, you're not in a studio like you sterile, childless wonders. ($30k+$2k homeowners ins) [$49k left]
- $500 /month in college loans ($6k) [$43k left]
- $10k / year in property taxes if you own an extremely modest house in a school district that doesn't suck. You're looking at private school if you don't because you don't hate your kids. [$33k left]
- Two cars because both parents have to either work or drive kids around. I'll completely ignore purchase price/leases and assume you own the cars. Fuel ($4k is surveyed average), repairs (wildly varies), insurance($2k), I'll call this one $7k but we all know this is ridiculously conservative [$26k left]
- Electricity, Internet, Food, Water, Fuel, cell phones, Netflix, Amazon prime. $8k easy. [$18k left].

You could stop here and say you have $1.5k a month to either save or YOLO. And many of you babyfaced autists wouldn't see the problem.

So, to the fun stuff:

- Family health insurance varies wildly. We'll use an employer subsidized plan that costs $600/month. That's another $7.2k plus deductibles. We'll go with perfectly healthy year and no fancy medication. $7.5k [11.5k left]. 
- Daycare/nanny? Location dependent. In New York suburbs it's $300/wk per kid for the cheap places. 2 kids? That's $2400 a month. $28k. You're done! In the red!
- Have to BUY a car or have payments? That's off the top, and wayyy out of budget.
- Are your taxes higher? Insurance sucks? Paying more for housing? YOLO puts in March? FUCK YOU, YER DONE!
- Hardship, storm, hospital, etc... FUCK YOU!

Could you pay less on some things? On housing? Probably, but you try to do the best for your kids if you can. You aren't my wife's boyfriend with no responsibilities. You also might want to buy them a bike and some clothes, you cheap fucks. Notice that's not anywhere in here?

Can you move to cheaper area? Yes, but if you have kids, you want a backup to watch them (or just one night out a year), and you trust family to do that. If you move, you lose that. Also costs money to move, and you can't keep your job.

Is this a sappy story about a family that has everything a poor person wants? Fuck yes it is. But it's still stressful as fuck to not want to lose a house and feel like an indentured servant to keep above water. You're not on easy street and you're not getting a single government handout. This is just the cost of putting your kids into good schools and giving them what used to be a normal middle class environment, but it's now considered privileged to want it.

OH YEA, DID I FUCKING MENTION COLLEGE COSTS FOR YOUR SHITTY KIDS?

Also, how deep are you in ONEM and do you think it‚Äôs a good options play or more buy and hold? The level it‚Äôs at now looks like a solid entry point at this supportThe only help I need is pumping PRPL so you gonna buy the fucking dip or whatAll in on anything purple this point, as well as the Crayola ETFYou sound like you buy putsThat‚Äôs why i said my vision was from god in the first post. But then after the last few days I felt like wsb deserved to know how the vision manifestedIV already got crushed this weekWho got evicted from their homes over the past 5 month? Everyone had rent and mortgage protection.I am Moses to the Mattress King‚Äôs Jesus of NazarethYou‚Äôre definitely right, spreads was the move here, which is what I am inBlade Runner 2049, Solo, Empire Strikes Back, Tron Legacy, Fantasia 2000[deleted]And whatever you do, definitely don't ever sleep on it!Soylent purpleIf I remember correctly, that case was thrown out. The guy making those claims was somehow involved with a competitor of Purple mattresses.There is definitely a lot of fucked up shit in mattresses. My GFs BF brought her an organic latex and cotton mattress which is pretty damn nice. No cancer it. He's a good guy.Shhhhhh, profits are the only thing that matterActually the guy who did the whole powder debacle worked for a competitor of PRPL called GHOST or some shit. Case was thrown out and they actually had to pay damages to PRPL because people like me and you legit thought it was some cancer shitKill is for families, murder is used for pets. Don't you know how to sell the rumor?Absolutely not, no problems in ba si i mean prpl mattressesIf I break even I swear to god I‚Äôll buy a purple mattressBecause I only know what stocks go up or stocks go down areLet's pump the meme's all weekend so RH retards start buyingIt‚Äôs going to take share in the mattress industry and then expand into other areas that require comfort products.Phew, thanks for donating to the cause. I was worried we wouldn't break $30, but now we're hitting $40!Oh fuck you boomer they crushed earnings and it tanked. That‚Äôs not how this is supposed to work. And I made it back in like 2 days. So kiss my much younger ass.Aye. Buying at 20 next week - hope those hands of yours are strongNo thankstrue, I buy a lot of things, just not your storyWell believe in Jesus and all will be revealed; that‚Äôs what I keep telling myself even tho lost like 3k a day for a week.Fuuuuuuuuuuck sorry for your loss mateNo no, they‚Äôre pretty nice to sleep onDoes it have that good spring-back for when she's getting railed?Shhh bby it's kNew product offering from purple: pet beds that help your pets sleep better, longer, forever.Bless your heart.But you guys are the RH retards so why not just skip a step and buy some more...?This cannot be overstated. This isn‚Äôt just a startup. These guys invented a patented material that‚Äôs in all sorts of comfort products (hospital beds, shoes, etc). 

They have a proven track record of success. Now they‚Äôre in their second Act with PRPL. Not just another company slapping a label on a foam mattress from China. Their shit is legit.

Hope you don't take it personally, the setup was just too goodThat's actually nice as fuckProb texting his friends and telling them about itThat's big facts, with everything being player dependent aswell it gives a sort of realistic supply/demand.Right, so you're just gambling lol. The idea is to let time work for you. The closer to expiration, the better chance you have of getting fucked.They‚Äôll finally recover from buying Kodak at 60So you do weeklies or monthly expiration and hold till expiration?Or PRPL at $27 or TSLA at $1700 or MRNA at $82 or LPTH at $4.6Go check out r/thetagang and do some reading. It's all about selling and letting time work for you. Sure, you can do plenty of weeklies if you have the risk tolerance. Never gonna get rich quick, but it's about winning a very high percentage of trades and slow grinding your account up while locking in profit early etc.Sounds like you bought every. single. one.  at the topI didn't buy any of these but I did short TSLA at $1770 when it first surged...PRPL goes up >30% after PRPL guys recommendations.

You desperately buy in after the huge run up.  It drops back to $24.

> *Those PRPL guys are fucking idiots and scammers!*

Did... did I get that right?I‚Äôm down -5000$ on my calls 8/21... I can post proof if you would like ... give me advice to not cry myself to sleepPRPL you god damn whore I bought 9/18 calls 2 days ago at the exact price the stock is at now and they're down 30%

2 days and the options are down 30%This was supposed to be the golden goose to bring me back from a 95% portfolio loss. How do I inverse myself?love it when i see you guys buy the topPussyThree solid months of growth, I buy in and boom. I am still up 5%, but I really fucked up not getting out at 300%. 

Maybe one day I will get lucky lol, (I am going to diamond this shit like I always do)Everyone thinks PRPL is dogshit now. By inversing WSB does that mean we need to buy the dip?Down about 3k in prpl calls. Oof. Still holding on to them though because at this point fuck it right? Maybe they'll skyrocket after earnings.Mattress bags getting heavy lolNext time read the DD...PRPL is doing just fine. It's currently down commensurately with the rest of the market and will recover. If you FOMOd and bought at the top, that's on you.‚Äúfuck that purple mattress pumper‚Äù?

Due, with all due respect, GTFOH with that nonsense. Mattress King‚Äôs DD was on the money. The $24-27 estimate, suggesting debit spreads, etc. I got in when he did after researching a little on my own and premiums jumped from 120 to 510. Like everything else with the market, you have to know when to go in, out, and have safeguards in place.You're such a fucking pussy it's making my dick real hardI‚Äôve made some good money on buying 20 and 25 calls when these guys first told us to weeks ago. Then I fucked it up by buying 35 calls on Tuesday when it was roaring so now I‚Äôm about even. 

These guys have been posting about this for months, you can‚Äôt fault them if you or I added late.I hope you sold and that it goes to 30 after earnings just to fuck with you.When you see multiple posts that‚Äôs when it‚Äôs time to sellI love all this seeing all this shit like this with PRPL. I bought $20 8/21 from this guy's DD and sold when it was $24ish dollars. I sold early but made almost 200% from it starting to become a meme stock. Seeing it all over WSB and watching the stock tank really showed how fucking autistic everyone on this sub is. Thanks for the porn.[PRPL gang](https://i.imgur.com/us6az4j.jpg)Lol they weren't pumping it, they were entirely right about it being undervalued. It shot up past $25 (which is a reasonable target) and then settled back down to where it should be. You guys are just idiots for buying a $23-25 stock at $27.Sir this is a casino. You‚Äôre expected to lose all your money.https://imgur.com/a/yrZGhhe


Gotta be some sign. I have both plays peloton & purpl.üòÇüòÇüòÇ remember the more people post about something on here. The more they do so cause they just bought at the top and they want lemmings to follow

Just like what happened with tsla and what‚Äôs going on with silver right now*Sir, this is not an AA meeting*I bought calls at 18 bucks so I don't need a support groupJust sell when it hits $28 on Wednesday you‚Äôll be fineDown 60% on my whole account because of this fucking gay ass shit. I should have cut my losses 3 days ago but noooo everyone thinks it's going to kill it in earnings, so I'm still holding. Probably going to tank to $10 per share next week.
PRPL is fucking garbageGoing to sky next week and through ER!  Hold and Win!Mommy it Huuuuuuuurts!I know everyone is hating on the stock right now but remember to look at the market as a whole. Almost every stock is doing terrible today.Perfect time to buy warrants.Why would you buy in after it rose 40% in 2 weeks with no red days in betweenWait so WSB pumps purple, and then has to make a support group for it!?

Where are the Silver posts now??

Where are the Peloton posts now!??

Where are the Tankers posts now!!??

Where are the Weed posts now!!??


hahaha.

Love WSB.

Is there a TQQQ support group? Nope, you know why? because it just always continues up after any drop.Imagine entering a position when a stock is almost double its previous ATH and being upset when it pulls back a few %.I‚Äôm down 50% on 9/18 $30c. Should I cut my losses before the weekend or hold and hope for a small run before earnings?Only those who bought $30c and $35c at the top need a support group... Spreads are doing just fine.Lol, in all the DDs the 'realistic' estimates were 27-28 from earnings. Why would you buy at 27.20 if you're looking for a short term.

&#x200B;

I know all three pump threads I made were, "OMG its dipping buy now!" at like 25ish or lower. (maybe 25.77 at highest, cant remember, too lazy to go look).

&#x200B;

I also as an avid Purple Pumper kept saying to buy spreads or sell put credit spreads. You misinterpreting the DD and getting greedy is on you.15p 8/21s. Fuck my calls.Well I got out two days ago at the top. I‚Äôm proud of myself.  First time I‚Äôve seen WSB catching onto something I had picked up early and I predicted the top was nearly in. Sold my spreads. 

Thinking about buying back in as I think there will be more run up into earnings. 

What are the expectations for earnings anyway?I've been diamond hands my 22.5c and 25c, after reading some of those calls on here I'm really glad I got in a couple weeks ago when those were OTM callsCalls were cheap today so I picked up some more. But yeah, the memeing was not organic and I think it scared away a lot of wsb.Where were you when PURPL was deadI bought one today . Let‚Äôs go next weeeeeekLMAO, Just sell 10 Covered calls at 35 dollars.I fucking guh‚Äôed when I looked at my phone around 11:30I mean, who could have possible seen this comingI have 5 08/21  30/35 spreads 
Am i retarded?I watched the shitpost video parody of 300 where prpl was the Persians, sold the morning before the big drop for an easy $1.3K gain, beware of fool‚Äôs goldI bought shares, and 2k worth of options at 22.5... :)i just looked at delta and theta on my 8/21 30c. fml it needs to start going next week i mean if u were up overall you could be averaging down into some calls here.  prpl was doing great today as shit was tanking until it too followed.I've been buying vertical spreads all week, 22.5/25. Fortunately it's still above my breakeven lmao.Who could have foreseen that the latest WSB meme play would go southHere I am waiting for my purple pillow to get shipped all the way to Australia. Only down -$159!Purple earnings annoucned for 8/13 - next thursday.  I have 300 shares plus 2 puts i opened at 22.50Y'all might as well buy one of their mattresses to put in your tent home for when this is all said and done. It will be a conversation piece for when the neighbors come over for meth dinner.imagine buying the dead topI'm glad I sold my remaining 9/18 $25 calls before the dip in the afternoon. Fortunately, I bought all my calls on 7/30 and got to ride the wave. Long term, PRPL is still a great play, but hard to tell how the market will react in the short term.Nice AH numbers. Can at least sleep well knowing I'm rolling 9/18sI took gains on an 8/21 30/35c spread the other day and rolled it into an 8/21 22.5/25c. I think it's likely that's the move. I have my doubts, and I'm tempted by other strategies and spreads in higher positions at this point. Also afraid to get wiped out and thinking about moving most of the money into 30/35c for 9/18 instead.How retarded are you?PRPL cheeks clappin‚Äô


https://youtu.be/JEi262i8ZRQBy the time IV crush hits, while theta decays the whole time, you're not gonna have enough pump to cover the -40%+ loss of value:/Guys let‚Äôs yolo life savings into a random mattress companyI‚Äôve been here since before Covid. I learned my lesson on Lumber Liquidators...Meet kevin dropped a video pumping prpl lets see how many of his followers fomoYup never following dd here with more then 2 posts  its always too late . You might get lucky and get a small bump  the day after but then it immediately tanks.I sold out of my positions around 26. will buy back around 20-22 if it goes back down there.From the tone of these posts those two PRPL pumpers are gonna be asking for witness protection program soon lmaoI'm glad my broker didn't have options so I bought stocks. Bagholding those through earnings now.Last time I took a little bit of profit early was before UPS mooned. Diamond hands this time baby.PITCHFORKS FOR PRPL GUYSounds like you got the purple tip right up your brown hole.Is prpl gang no bueno now1. If you sold your 1k of PRPL now, then you weren't really listening to the "purple mattress pumper." He clearly stated that it's a long term play, not a short one. It's only been a few days for you. The stock is down as of this moment because the whole market plunged. In my own opinion, I am very confident it will go back up.
2. To all of you who are losing on call options, it's probably because you didn't buy spreads (which the "pumper" explicitly mentioned). You're suffering from IV Crush.I was up 200% now I'm only up like 10%

Stop order is GTC at 0%I‚Äôm short purple. My wife and her bf tell me Casper is a better bed.I was trading PRPL in mid-July, but the move started to feel unnatural so I got out. If you watch it on the daily, there was a point last week where it went from around $23 to $21 the first 45mins of trading, then back up to $23 in the next 30mins, insinuating light volume that was susceptible to profit taking volatility from any large player (i.e. HF, MF, institutions). Add to that the WSB pump (which at this point this sub is large enough to have an impact on less liquid stocks), the $30 and $27 analyst PT updates, and it was pretty clear to me that this spike was setting up for profit taking ahead of earnings (why wouldn‚Äôt you de-risk ahead of an event with less remaining upside if you‚Äôve just seen a massive run up...).

At current levels it‚Äôs probably good for a lift back into earnings. But anyone who reads this, be careful... I‚Äôve had a few plays (PRPL, ELY, SNE, RCII) that WSB posted about, the stock moved too much into earnings then got hit by profit taking either ahead of or immediately after good earnings. Luckily I was wary of these moves and exited my positions in a timely manner, but as traders you all still need to be aware of how liquidity and small players bidding a stock up into a catalyst sets it up for profit taking from larger players that were there before you.I sold a cash covered put 9/18 22.5 which is now like 1% green.

I bought a call debit spread 8/21 22.5/25 which is currently like 20% down, but has a break even at 24 and max profit at 25 so I'm not super worried yet.

Both trades were entered on monday when PRPL was at 25 or so if I remember right.

Gonna hold both till earnings.LMAO dude has made so much money on PRPL you BOUGHT THE TOPYou guys have heard of PRPL, but have you heard of CSPR?I played with shares and sold a covered call. I'm cool here.My first ever options play was PRPL at 27.20. I bought only 1 single call and have nearly lost it all already. Amazing.

What happens if this hits zero? Can it go lower into the negative? Should I sell now and cut all my losses, or will this mattress actually bounce back after 8/13 earnings report?Yeah fuck the guy who's literally been posting about it for months that you waited till the ACTUAL TOP. I'm up over 200% from when i first read both of there DD's and it wasn't till idiots like you came along that fucked up the stock for the first time since I bought at $14/shareDid anyone stop to think that maybe, *just maybe*, the earnings are priced in?

Even if the DD is legit, the stock has run up 100% in the last 3 months.  Even at $20, it's way up.  How do you know that the true valuation is $25 and not $20?Your dumb the guy never expected it to hit that high that fast. He was predicting it would likely
Be close to 25 before earnings and 25-27 after.

Edit: also I was in this play at start of July, cashed out last Friday for huge gains. You fomod[deleted]fell for the oldest trick in the book.[deleted]These purple pickle pumpers üçÜ have been doing this here just so you guys all get $ROPE‚Äôd - she‚Äôs the stankiest bitch up in this piece. Don‚Äôt do it to yourselves man.he's been pumping it for months and you managed to buy the literal top. Congrats, you're retardedbingoI bought in at $19. Still up 100% on my 9/18 @$17.5c and $20c, but damn it was tempting to cash out a Tuesday morning at almost a 300% gain. 

Hoping to see a run up again to $27 by earnings next week.Exactly right. I'm up 100% overall because I listened (not early enough for those cheap warrants though.) It was expected to be around here going into earnings, so it's right no track, people are just upset because it spiked early and they got in too late.It‚Äôs wild, the dude was pumping it for awhile now. I want to say it was $18 or so when I debated and decided it wasn‚Äôt for me?

SLV is having this same thing. Kodak before that.Dont FOMO. Well at least not weekly.Fleeced.These are the same kinda philosophies that see a 1% pullback as the fuckin END OF DAYS. zoom out.Beta vs chad bag hilderI‚Äôm down 1200. Thank you for making me feel better.down $7400. I would like my gold metal now please. or should i say PURPLEdown 3.5, holding.  Also wearing a PRPL shirt all next week for good luck.I'm down $1.6K heading to $2K. Hopefully we will all look back on this a week from now and laugh with relief.are these posts joking or are you all seriously gambling tiny amounts, that are also 100% of your portfolio, on options you don‚Äôt understand, for a company you‚Äôd never heard of before recently, that sells a product you can‚Äôt even afford (because lost all your dough on options), without understanding the actual value in the company is supply chain efficiencies that are not proprietary?Just sleep on a purple mattressWe need proof.I'll post my loss porn on 8/21. Its ok though I've got stock in $ROPE.Imagine making millions then convincing other people to buy in at ATHs after u made ur money...wallstreet funds prolly sending out thank you letters to those guys...Implied volatility dropping pretty rapidlyPretty sure that dude showing his 2m gainz from Grimace the mattress is selling you calls. He‚Äôs a theta overlord and will always win.Bought the same calls 3rd week of July, theta nearly the same. Feel stupid for not doing spreads. Can't decide if I want to hold post earnings and risk the crush or sell Wednesday before...god damnitMe too, then I bought some more and the new ones are down too like 30%

Need JPOW to pump thisThose will probably recoverIt's not PRPL's fault that you have no clue what theta isShould‚Äôve opened a spread to cover your ass.PRPL is 84% of my portfolio currently lol. Every dip I sell more metals to buy PRPL, and I'm up overall... thanks dips!  
(up more than I'd be if I held metal too due to using spreads).A non-believer, smite him oh faithful oneFWIW all the detailed DD from you and u/lurkingsince2006 has made me a long term investor in PRPL (is long term investing on this sub anathema?). I mean, I still *really* hope earnings bumps all my positions in the near term, but I'll likely be holding and rolling for the foreseeable future. Thanks again.I fucking doubled downed because of you.


Gonna do it again, third times a charm!These motherfuckers dont understand going long. Shit doesnt just grow 5000% overnight.Truly hope earnings kills it and you do good, but you must be down 1 mil by now. Unless I was filthy rich, a loss like that would give me explosive diarrhea.Screenshot your account right now , we want to see the unrealized loss porn.Damn boi 

Made my Friday. I got a chuckle, straight savageness on this pussyboiThese spineless whiny assholes can fuck off it‚Äôs called DD. Not HH (hand holding) I was skeptical of PRPL a month ago. And I watched. Then I got in off the sidelines last week and I‚Äôm still glad I did as it‚Äôs been the most profitable thing I‚Äôve ever seen happen in my portfolio since I yolo‚Äôd into this Shitshow market back in April.You re are the choosen one, and like all choosen ones in all religions you must die for our sins, We must crucify you so we unbelievers can be saved.I will continue to buy on red days, in it over 10k and not planning on stopping.Would selling covered calls against my shares make me a purple pussy?I fucked up and bought jan 30 c instead of vertical spreads. Down a cool 50%.So purple prophet, how can you explain this current multi day dip?You did get lucky you fucking idiot. You were up 300%. Wtf is wrong with you?Usually yeahI bought the dipI hope you've got bull debit spreads, otherwise you risk suffering IV Crush. In short: even after PRPL reports earnings, your calls could *still* plummet.I‚Äôm holding on for dear life.Can I join your gangHow do I get the small pp gang flare?sed -i 's/Matress/Body/g'One of you guys even said you were expecting it to go to about 24, and that's why people should buy spreads and not just calls. It's their own fault for buying in at 27.Lol, I think he might be sarcastic. In another comment the OP mentioned he just doubled his investment on PRPL =POr added 35s lol ü§£me right hereThe advise has been worth it from them. We are discussing a buyer at the top upset about it dipping down a few percentage points; that would have only been possible if the company was doing well and on a tear as of late. 

The company‚Äôs stock can and will go higher going forward‚Äîno doubt.Fuck you im doubling down. The fear of not missed opportunity is greater than losingUnfortunately, this will happen üò≠I should have waited an extra day or two to buy in hahaha. I'm buying in when SLV gang is crying though lolIt‚Äôs way more than that at this pointNah, Silver has an actual case of hitting 2011 levels of $48.

More printing by world governments causing it.Yep!
hahaMeh, one dude has been recommending PRPL consistently for like 6 months to my knowledge and it shot up over 400% after the crash.!remindme 7 daysIf it drops to 10/share I will empty my bank account on sharesIf you think its garbage then you should sell you retard.What a retard.R I S K   T O L E R A N C EWrong.

Currently:  
PRPL: 24  
PRPLW: 6.4

Theoretical price: (24 - 11.5) / 2 = 6.25

Currently PRPLW is overpriced by 0.15. Good way to lose 2%.It‚Äôs called circle jerking a meme you degenerate. 

Welcome to WSBThere was a tanker support group post although EURN is almost at $10 again so woot woot.I sold off a third of mine because I didn't think they were going anywhere.I unloaded half my 9/18 30s a few days ago and kept the other half for the last (hopefully) run pre-earningsI think the Mattress King would say hold on for a runup before earnings, but I would say dump 'em!  I don't think 30 has a chance.  Don't listen to me though.This. Anyone who followed the DD is still in profit so any complaining are retarded FOMO‚Äôers. If PRPL is 30 in Jan I‚Äôm happy for Christ sake.Good question. The one who told us all about PRPL actually predicted that it would end up in the $25-30 range, so I'm personally not confident in a 30/35 spread. I think that people generally suggest that you buy calls ITM (in the money), but I'm not sure if that applies to spreads. I personally bought a 22.5/30 bull debit spread.This...............It‚Äôs not south. It‚Äôs gone up way faster than I thought.Why puts and shares?Doubt it falls that much.Not scared.LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO> He clearly stated that it's a long term play, not a short one.

I too would tell people something was a "long term" play if I wanted them to hold my bags and not dump short term while I was trying to sell off to suckers running up the price.

I'm sure those guys have made hundreds of thousands churning the stock as they buy off fleeing speculators at the "lows" and sell to a new batch of suckers at the highs.  They've said they buy on the dips, they just don't tell you they're also the ones selling when everyone fomos in and spikes the price.No please. Tell Me moreYou cannot go into negatives. What you paid was a premium for the option, not the stock. If you're asking this question, I'd venture to guess you haven't really done much research on options. Which I understand‚Ä¶¬†a lot of people on this sub haven't =P

I'd highly suggest that you read up on what IV Crush is (which PRPL options will clearly suffer from). Then read up on debit spreads (bull call) and see how you can use that to buy a call at a lower price to limit your losses and avoid IV Crush. Hope that helps.

PS. It's up to you if you wanna sell the call. Calls that have high IV (implied volatility) usually will go down, EVEN if earnings calls are great! A few weeks ago, one guy threw his $100k portfolio on Tesla options (super high IV), then Tesla reported an earning. He thought he'd wake up a millionaire. He woke up with a $9k portfolio. Had he done debit spreads, he would have done much better.You bought options without knowing the basics of an option.Compare PRPL to TPX (Tempur Pedic), looks like PRPL has a good chance of getting 0.4-0.5 EPS, comparing to TPX, this should place PRPL around 27-30. Not quite priced in!

They announced the date yesterday.earnings next ThursdayThe funny thing about earnings is that they're reported 4 times a yearLol I don‚Äôt buy any of the shit shilled on here.same position as you i cashed a portion of my gains that dayI'm + 30c, -22.5p and -35c. Im definitely closing the puts before earnings, but might let that spread ride. Its only, 20% OTM? YeeshYour other 100% will be faded next week FYI when mkts have a major sell offYa I should have cashed out on SLV when I saw 3 posts here about it last night.
I learned though, 3 or more WSB posts on a ticker within a few hours means I need to get out.What about Silver?Down 3300 on my 8/21 calls. It‚Äôs sick af isn‚Äôt it?I‚Äôm down 18k on my $25C 08/21. Please give me the medalNot even gold will help, down $600 on GLD calls rn.LmaoThisHope to the PRPL Gods you‚Äôre right.This is where Men are made.  Wallstreet saw an opportunity to cuck and ran with it.You don‚Äôt think on WSB you just DO! And the company is solid long term but I/we all need it to do something crazy in the short termYupI have two harmony pillows before I ever started investing.  *shrug*. That‚Äôs enough for me to know my money is good.I don't want back problems, just moneyNah, the run up is just beginning.yeah which is not what I expected approaching earningswhy is the IV on them dropping so much as we approach earningsThe option is six weeks out and theta is -0.0387, this is a combo of IV and interest dropping not thetaAss spreads gets you moneyWtf are spreads? Sounds gay.But it limits gains. Straight calls or puts us the bestYou're retardedDamn PRPL is a cult... I am going to get some calls just to be part of it!

What type crazy shit you guys do?Get rich or die quickly.Did you listen to the podcast they posted? They want to provide comfort to people in as many places as possible. Seat cushion sales were up 700% due to covid.Agreed, I am tracking cash flow on a spreadsheet and planning to buy more while the stock is <$24 for the foreseeable futureInstead of doubling down, try rolling forward your long position on down days, especially when IV is low.I'm sure his spreads are doing just fine...Buying on Tuesday, like op, was buying ultra high on speculative news that had been essentially prebaked in.This is the way. I‚Äôm currently diamond handing my shit and averaging down any chance I get. I can‚Äôt see it staying below 24 honestly.More like purple PhD. Sell high 35sI think those are really safe.I fucked up even more than you, bought into 17 8/21 $30c, then averaged down twice to get 50 total calls and I‚Äôm now down 37%. Soooo yeah, I might sell a bunch Monday and get spreads but not really sure what to do. I only found out about mattress King‚Äôs positions after being recommended into getting PRPL.You apparently aren't retarded enough to understand markets and stonks are volatile.Lucky as in I sell at the right time. But you are right I did seriously fuck up.Do you have to buy the call at the same exact time or can you wait to buy ? I bought 8 calls yesterday and just learned that selling a call at a higher price could help.Huh, just realized my 8/21 call is at 150% IV. I guess I should have paid more attention to that sooner lol. Oh well, with any luck earnings are bright and things somehow turn around and I can come out better than the -590 I'm currently at.Unfortunately no, I bought naked calls like a true autist. I was up 2.5k and didn't sell when I knew I should and now I'm getting bent over for it. I have a strong belief that the stock will have a good run up to earnings so I can at least minimize my losses. How strong the run up to earnings is will be the determining factor on whether I sell before or just hold and pray. 

Strong run up? I sell before to help mitigate IV crush and take it as a lesson.

Weak run up? I'll hold through earnings and pray there's a spike afterwards that puts at least the $30 calls ITM or ATM.

I am open to suggestions at this point. I've thought about closing the positions and reopening them as spreads but idk.You gotta have small PP.ExactlyHmm. Well, nonethelessYou‚Äôre deadass expecting a 300% beat?

Have about 300 shares rn, no options. Averaged down to around 24/25.Yeah today is the big boys fucking with everyoneDon‚Äôt say that. I have calls on 30.Proof or BANTriple down or poonIm starting to think theres more to it than just the govt printing but hell im in for some callsIt‚Äôs gotta gap up or gold gap down.. but with this uncertainty I think it‚Äôs gonna hot $30 by OctoberYou and u/lurkingsince2006 should take a cut from these people complaining when we make it to tendie town!I will be messaging you in 7 days on [**2020-08-14 18:33:47 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2020-08-14%2018:33:47%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i5imvr/prpl_support_group/g0phrac/?context=3)

|-|-|-|-|Buy me some too cause I'll be at $0But I want money and I believe all these other retards that it might go up next week.
But I'm retarded so idkYou assume that PRPL will finish at 24 though.tanker gang checking inSucks that you had to unload half your ticket to tendie town.9/18 30c is not a bad play. 8/21 30c? WoofI meant I sold 2 covered puts. I'm quite comfortable with buying shares as they worked well for me with AMD.  I'm in purple for the log run.   I like shares because when stocks are priced for perfection, earnings tends to disappoint and a good company will run up after earnings.  I've been burned enough on options that unless I know for certain it will be a sure winner, I don't play.

I tried placing an order for purple 4 bed today and got this message: We are experiencing shipping delays

Our U.S. factories are working around the clock, but due to the extremely high recent demand for our amazing products, we are currently unable to deliver as fast as we typically do.

I got sold on purple after I saw their pet beds and seat cushions. They are more than just a mattress company. Also if you go to twitter and search "purple mattresses" it seems everyone loves the company.If it does fall that much though I am buying $20c and $22.5c until I have no more $ left.Except there‚Äôs zero evidence that the person in question has actually done this, and has even made his hand super clear by showing his plays. PRPL has moved in accordance to his analysis in the past. The losers are the people who do not listen. It is strongly evidenced in this comment section‚Äîtons of people failed to heed the advice to buy spreads, and instead just bought calls hoping to make a quick buck. The PRPL promoter literally said that you can avoid IV Crush with spreads and warrants. What do people do? Everything but that. Basically, people need to stop crying over lost profits only to blame others or attribute malice to feel better about themselves.It‚Äôs true and thanks for the info. I‚Äôve been researching and threw just a few hundred bucks that I was fine with losing at something to try out the little I knew. Since everyone buying this week is getting crushed, I don‚Äôt feel completely terrible, haha. And I‚Äôve already learned more by practicing with stakes in the game than I have on researching before. Onward and upward.Pretty much! Still learning. Only a small amount I was prepared to lose.I think adjusted will be closer to .90What u here for then, camaraderie?I broke the golden rule.

If it‚Äôs worth a screenshot, it‚Äôs worth cashing out. 

I took a screenshot on my phone because that put my portfolio up 160%...and then I let it ride because my nips were prplAny particular reason your betting on a sell off?Actually, My silver options were same priced as what is what yesterday close even 3% down today, unless you bought FDsDown 2700 8/21 calls.I think PRPL Man should buy our medals, seeing as he is the one who now has our moniez after he sold us those calls...mad, retarded respect yo. I'm down 8k, you win.Where is prpl manYOLOHolding on for next week because of this commentGoing down with the purpl overlords. We‚Äôre crying here about a couple of grand but these guys are holding serious $$$. Lets ride it to tendie town!You can scream into them as PRPL heads to 20.Hey dude. I'm a beginner and I just cashed out from Tesla and have $1500. I wanna invest it on purple. What's your call ?

A bull debit spread ? If so, pls let me know what position you would go for ? I'll get in that position right awayBull debit spreads is probably what you should be interested in, not just straight up buying calls. Spreads supposedly help you avoid IV Crush.Because the volume is so low I thinkYou have September calls?  Why are you sweating it...Not as many people buying calls due to weak hand shake out I believe. More call buying drives price up.Maybe $24 or $25 is what the market has decided PRPL is worthGuh I can't read dates. I thought you said 8/21May be the only way to get inverted here.The only potential loss is dignity, and we're on WSB so that sets potential losses to 0.Mike Honcho agrees!Technically, they're biA spread is buying the more than one contract for the same underlying security with the same Expiration date but different strike prices.This is the asshole that‚Äôs causing GLD to slip, let‚Äôs get him!We choke each others dick til it turns purpl then release.I‚Äôve never felt more part of something than when I bought my first PRPL calls at $27 and started losing money with these retardsNow is a good time. 22.5/25 spreadsGive each other PRPL NRPLs all dayIncreasing sales of 1 seat cushion to 7 is technically a 700% but still patheticWhat podcast was it?REEEEEE Go back to r/investingWhat do you mean by rolling forward a long position?How does one roll forward a long position on down days? I don't know what you mean, and I trade options. I'm just not familiar with the terminology.When I was up around 200% on my calls I was upset I wasn‚Äôt gonna have another opportunity to enter, well I got my wish ü•≥truth. reading about the purple bros made me a cult member for life‚Äîmattresses are dope im sure, but there's a reason they're purple *innovation*. These fuckers with their 30 patents, nike shoes, dr scholls, mattress max, 'murican made mormon black helicopter space tech.

 Not even taking profits yet‚Äîevery red day is a damn sale for me. I can't get enough prpl shares.Got no choice but to diamond hand them. All 30 of them.Fuck what luck did you expect that would trigger you to sell on 300%, slip on your jizz stain on the floor and knock your head on the sell button?Luck is getting the direction right. Choosing to not sell has nothing to do with itNormally when you sell a call, you must own the stock. Selling a call means you're selling someone the option to buy PRPL that you already own. (In technical terms, they have the right to buy the "underlying stock" from you).

Bull debit spreads are different. You'd be buying and selling calls at the exact same time. This "underlying stock" from the calls you sold would be covered by the "underlying stock" from the calls you bought. In laymen's terms, they kind of cancel each other out.

In short, bull debit spreads don't require you to own stock. But on Robinhood, the debit spreads are done as a single transaction, which is what I believe allows the call/sell to cancel each other out.

You could, I suppose, sell your current calls, then use the proceeds to invest in debit spreads. Is it too late? Does it make sense to do it now? You'll definitely have to do your own research. But hopefully all of this makes sense and helps!Generally speaking, unless Purple REALLY REALLY KILLS IT, you are still in danger of an IV Crush. You can read here, an example where someone bought 100K of Tesla options, Tesla reported killer earnings, and the next day his portfolio was worth 9k: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hwheds/bought_100k_in_tesla_724_calls_they_reported/fyzvm2j/?context=3

PRPL is currently $24(ish). Let's say you have a $25 call and you paid a $5 premium. That means PRPL has to reach $30 for you to break even. PRPL earnings come out, they do great, and their stock goes to $28. Guess what? You're still down $2. Everyone knows your option is only intrinsically worth $3. My best understanding of IV Crush is when the mystery of what it could be worth is gone.

Now if PRPL does insanely well and goes to $32 (a 33% increase!), then you net $2. Stocks rising 33% on an earnings call seems pretty rare. The odds are probably against you. Bull debit spreads help mitigate the losses you'd suffer due to IV Crush‚Ä¶ but it also limits your earnings.Oof, yeah that's a hard one. The only reason I know about this is because I suffered major IV Crush on Tesla a couple weeks back. Tesla reported killer earnings and I thought I'd strike it rich the following day. But behold‚Ä¶ my options went down 90%!

I looked up bull debit spreads not too long ago. That's what I currently have in PRPL, because I've learned it protects against IV Crush. That said, you probably don't want to take suggestions from me. I can only relay my understanding of the research I've done.

If PRPL hits $30, that would be a dream, haha. I currently have a $22.5/$30 bull debit spread. I break even at $25.16, and I have high confidence it'll be above that point before my 8/21 expiry.Top line I‚Äôm expecting a 30% beat, bottom line somewhere in the 200-400% beat.Or more.https://imgur.com/a/3BMzmDbThis is just... lol.Not assuming anything, pointing out that PRPLW is theoretically over priced.Fuck tendies, the only valuable currency in life is the experience gained by losing a shit ton on optionsYou‚Äôre right. I didn‚Äôt read the expiry date. September has a chance.Only gambling with money you're willing to lose‚Äîyou're doing it right. Anyways, if you think PRPL will go back up (I have a hunch it might, but do your own research), then bull debit spreads might interest you. In short, it's cheaper, limits your losses, but caps your gains. I personally have a $22.5/30 bull call (bought $22.50 calls, sold $30 calls, same underlying stock which means I don't have to actually own the stock).But you could have literally read a short article by googling ‚ÄúWhat is an option trade?‚Äù Which you should still do.Usually because of lack of oxygenIt‚Äôs time for a downtrend soon based on many technical reasons. Mkts are losing fumes and reasons to go higher...You have all officially made me feel better about my temporary lossat the very least he had you guys pumping the value of his callsRight hereThey bought in way before it ran up. I'm sure they'll sleep fine.The most comfortable screams.They avoid IV crush because the call you sell loses more value to IV crush than the one you buy. 

Since the call you sell in a debit spread is a higher strike, it's price is more contingent on its extrinsic value (time til expiration and implied volatility) than the lower strike call you bought.

So you are correct, if you're trying to play earnings and you're bullish, if you hold a call debit spread through earnings you won't get destroyed by IV crush2 days later same stock price september calls are 30% cheaper that's why I'm sweatin it, now much less likely to be profitable

edit: puts were the same deal, lost a solid 30% value in the past two daysSeriously! $30 8/21 and I'm sweating over here!In these PRPL worship sessions am I required to choke 2 dicks? Or just the one to my right?Actually laughed so hardMe too bro, me too, I feel like I'm part of a movement, the holy MEMEing of a stockhttps://www.podcast.vivoom.co/post/purple-vp-of-brand-burke-morley-no-longer-a-sleeper
It's VP of branding, he talks a lot about himself.. But he drops a lot of knowledge about the way they think. Very important too he says their biggest driver of sales is word of mouth referrals. Anyone who tries it loves it and tells everyone about how amazing it is. Sounds like the cult product/stock you love to be a part ofYou mean r/options.  You think the cucks at r/investing know anything about options?????I thought it would keep going up. Got greedy. I figured it would just run up until earnings or keep steady, not crash.Hey not who you were talking to but thank you for this explanation, as someone who keeps seeing people say to buy debit spreads instead and not knowing wtf that means I thank you for your easy enough to understand explanation!I have 2 8/21 @ 1.75 and 8 @ 1.55 for an average of 1.59. So it sounds like I could come close to breaking even or at least coming out less than a hundred in the hole. Could be much worse I guess, we'll see how it plays out.Oh I'd actually be very surprised if you didn't hit your break even price before earnings with the way the stock has been performing so far.Oh fuck. Buying more shares right now.I know you‚Äôve been asked endless times, I‚Äôve asked multiple times as well, but with the share under 24 right now, 25/30 spreads for August/September/October any good?or would IV just eat my ass?This guy fucks, and by fucks I mean fucks his whole life up, 

TLDR

PRPL 25c 8/21What a champ.I can get behind this.You fucking degenerate. How might I level up?How much do you have to lose before you start making money?I will be looking into that, thanks! I‚Äôm holding for now as a pure experiment in risk tolerance at this point. I have to laugh when I open my RH app.How do bull spreads protect you against IV crush if you enter the position when IV is low?

In this case where IV shot up and then crushed back down, you would have still sold the call at low IV, so I don't understand.Well that could be next week or next month. Who knowsSame. I feel if we just hold on till ~Wednesday we‚Äôll see green. Same with SLV.I have all my calls stillOmniscient mattress god.guess I need some better pillows.Oh you mean doing what I recommended..... everyone bought naked calls... not my play or my strikes.Can you sell calls at bullish prices a few days after buying calls ? Or do you have to do it simultaneously. I bought 8 $30 calls yesterday and have been thinking of buying more to get them at a lower average.did you enter into spreadswith good reason... this is going to need a hell of a boost on earnings for those to print... but if they do print you'll be happy... and it could happen!Just the one to your right, need to use both hands.üòÇüòÇüòÇThis is absolute truth. I convinced my sister and best friend to buy Purple 4 and 3, respectively. I also talk about it regularly with friends for the past 2 years.Can understand, but 300% is a lot, think about that next time, hopefully it happens againGlad it helps! You have to turn on spreads as a feature on Robinhood. I highly recommend doing a bit more research on it before you plunge into it, though.I hope so. Fingers crossed for both of us!üòÇBull spreads do not protect you against IV Crush if IV is already low, because IV Crush is a phenomenon that happens to high IV, if I understand correctly.

"In this case" ‚Äî In what case? In the case of the user to whom I responded to? Because if so, it doesn't sound like s/he bought it when then IV was low. A lot of options are currently in 100% or higher IV, which is considered pretty high.Def can be next week, best of luck!Wow a reply from the Mattress King himself

My plan is to go long on some spreads on PRPL soon. Just going to play shares for earnings next week because there's not many options when it comes strikes. I appreciate the DDs manI feel like you sold a part of your portfolio this morning.Yeah, you can average down with the total price with calls the same way as you can with shares. Typically, if your calls are in the money by a good amount and you want to "guarantee" your gains, you can sell the strike above it to get some premium, but doing so caps your potential gains on your long calls (obviously it's not 100% guaranteed because shit can fall any amount at any time)that seems awkward. do both sides, and the dude 2 down will provide the other hand.  every dick gets choked by 1 hands from 2 people. 

&#x200B;

efficiency.For real, good luck man. Hope you make some money!The IV percentile is perhaps more important than the IV itself. In terms of percentile, its at 63, which does make it a bit higher than normal for PRPL.How can you tell option IV before you buy it in Robinhood?  I feel like they only show you after, which is retarded.

Oh, I was referring to the two Purple guys who set up call spreads awhile ago, when the IV was presumably lowNegativeNow this gets weird because you guys are putting too much thought into this. We‚Äôre in a circle, you do guy on your right. Done.That's weird‚Ä¶ I can see the IV on an option call before buying, under its Stats section.On mobile device, to see IV: Tap on the stock option, then you will see under Limit Price, "Bid $xxx ‚Ä¢¬†Ask $xxx". Tap on that to see the Implied volatility.Yeah, I don't like weirdWhat this guy said, we‚Äôre not here because we can do math, we‚Äôre here because we drink Elmers glue and buy spy puts. Two hands and one dick is about as many variables as I can handleomg I can't believe I've been trading for 4 months and never knew that.

puts on my intelligenceHaha, no problem. I really had to dig for it myself before I first found out where it is. I low key think Robinhood hides a lot of these more advanced features on purpose‚Ä¶¬†they know people are more willing to spend money when things are easy to use. Surfacing more of the pro stats would make us Robintards less likely to commit to a spend =PYeah I actually looked for it awhile back and clicked the gear icon, which shows a few other things but not the technical info, so I just assumed it wasn't a feature in RH.

Weird that they put it as just an arrow on the limit range.  I thought that arrow was just something pertaining to the limit range so I always ignored it.

1. Keep track of 1-3 tickers that have high volume and are liquid af. I'm in tech and this past week the main stocks I traded are Microsoft, Docusign, and Zooom
2. Know your support levels. This is crucial for getting a good entry so you're not the dumbass buying at the top. For me, Msft is 200, Docu is 200, Zoom is 250. Resistance eventually becomes support, so be flexible.
3. Once the stock hits support level, scale into your positions. Don't be a retard and go all in immediately. Buy 2, then 4, etc etc. Get 10-20% OTM calls expiring in 4-6 weeks. If you're looking for a lotto ticket, get one that expires in 2-3 weeks.

Can  Trump really do that? He‚Äôs been on sleeping this power for months and gives him free reign to have JPOW print more like we‚Äôre Venezuela.How do u guys lose 100k and shrug it off even if I had millions it would still bother meI think I am beginning to understand why most traders lose money their first two years overall. 

You essentially have to rewire your brain's motivation / reward centers in order to take profit at optimal times, and enter positions at optimal times.

My buddy that has traded both the 2000 and 2008 recessions told me I need to start buying when the market continues to rally on bad news. I didn't listen and now I'm homeless, having to sell my supple bear body for tendies to buy FD puts that never print.Alright boys hear me out

Edit: Long DRRX, PEIX, Short UMC 8/21 $5r/gaystreetbetsAs you step out into the street, you feel a tickle in your nose. The paint on your upper lip smells strange, but you feel beautiful. A young boy who spots you yells, ‚ÄúThe Tin Man!‚Äù You smile, but mumble to yourself *The Silver Man*. Still, you put a hand to your chest to check for a heart.

Suddenly you hear someone scream, ‚ÄúFreak!‚Äù You look up, and a boy on a skateboard is blazing towards you. You‚Äôre struck, then everything goes black.

Three days later, you awaken in a hospital. The doctor in the room looks concerned. ‚ÄúWhere did you get it?‚Äù Assuming she means your wounds, you answer: ‚ÄúA boy, on a skateboard.‚Äù She sighs, ‚ÄúNo, I mean the aluminum dust.‚Äù

You knew it was the best. For the look. To be a walking manifestation of your SLV calls. Like a devout follower‚Äîno, a prophet‚Äîyou wanted the world to know about the infinite power of silver. You nod and smile for several minutes.

Eventually, in response to your silence, the doctor says: ‚ÄúYour lungs are damaged beyond repair.

Buying High and Selling LowContrarian thought.  Everyone is worried about inflation, but M2 money velocity continues to drop.  I actually think deflation is more probable in the next year or two even with a bunch of stimulus.  If everyone is hoarding, it should impact equities and commodities and push bonds even lower.  I think the market has overshot the concern on inflation and a rush to the dollar may very well be next.Pls give me your energy for AAL to hit 16$Why do so many retards here have tunnel vision on tech?

Do you retards not realize the insane gains small caps and the finance sectors were making this week?  I see no one talking about doing calls on banks or IWM or XLR etfs.

See you fuckers Sunday night. Usual time, usual placeSo how many of these stories of people betting their families life savings do you think are real? I get losing the money you earned yourself but the idea of taking money from my significant other and blowing it all seems so fucking ridiculous. I tend to just think they‚Äôre karma whores.Donnie Pump basically told landlords to get f**kedWhat is your main goal for trading?

Like whenever I pick any trade with any rationale I can come up with it just goes wrong. Or it goes wrong enough for me to paperhand switch sides and then shit goes favourably. This is worse than just losses as I am now doubting my vibe and can't find any confident play. Do you guys experience this too or is it just me ?You can feel it now. MAJOR vaccine success news and stimulus checks will be released this week or the next and we are going to all time highsRobinhood weekend check counter , 3 times this morning...

GUESS HE WAITING ON $WMT +Anyone else feel like it is a bunch of 16 year old and adults with $1k accounts posting here?After hours Apple is my boy[deleted][https://stocknews.com/news/spy-inx-dia-iwm-qqq-how-to-trade-this-stock-bubble/](https://stocknews.com/news/spy-inx-dia-iwm-qqq-how-to-trade-this-stock-bubble/)

"*GDP declined -32% last quarter and the market raced higher.*

*Q2 Earnings Season showed a 35% drop in corporate earnings and the market raced higher.*

*Coronavirus cases DOUBLED and, you guessed it, the market raced higher.*

This disconnect from economic reality has all the markings of a stock bubble. So why should the music stop at 3,300?

I sense that investors want to touch the all-time high at 3,393 the same way a young child needs to touch stove to learn an important life lesson. Just no amount of lecturing from the adults in the room can prevent it from happening.

To believe that the worst economic event in our lifetimes only resulted in a 3 week bear market when the average bear is 13 months long is absolutely fanciful and borderline insane. Aka‚Ä¶the markings of a bubble.

The main question at this time is WHEN is the bubble ready to burst. Again, I believe that is September/October because that is when I suspect that this modest bounce in economic data rolls over and goes quite negative once again. Plus that is when we will be faced with the unknowns of the Presidential Election which usually lops 5-10% off stock prices."[deleted]‚ÄúWe have the money‚Äù

From where?

Last time we hit +120m shares was on July 22nd when SLV closed at $21.44. With all the volatility today and the MASSIVE amount of volume, we're now flat over 24 hours. This is very bullish IMO. Glad I stayed the course. I expect more volatility ahead, but with a bullish trajectory moving forward.I was down 60% for the year, now only down 5% year to date thanks to silver calls. I‚Äôd be green for the year if silver go up on Monday!

donnie got me

but now i think it‚Äôll go back up and market being big gayIt feels like since 08, we built this bubble on lower Fed rates and with Covid, we may be doomed to keep pumping up equities until The Fed eventually is forced to raise rates. Which ironically is both a sign of economic health but also will tank markets bigly.

Basically we are putting off another recession in equities so that we can keep shit afloat now, but once we have an actually healthy economy won't this practice eventually lead to stagnation in stocks?  Especially if this Tech bull run slows down any.How are people feeling about Silver for next week? 

Likely to hit 30+? or drop to below 27-26? 

IMHO I think that We'll see another rise up to 29.8 - 30.5 and then a dip to 26, then a slow rise until a stimulus is passed where it'll gap up like in 2010 to 35-40Why in the fuck did I not buy more Berkshire B at 199?I'm balls deep in some NIO. Can someone tell me everything with be ok on Tuesday.excited to get my fucking face ripped off next week by timmy.Bought BRK/B shares in February before market died, bought a few shares after the crash as I didn't want to sink too much money in it to reduce my average.

Fastly is down because there is anticipation they will lose business from Tiktok.

Microsoft is up because there is anticipation they will buy Tiktok.

Facebook is up because they are releasing an app/feature with capabilities similar to Tiktok.


If Microsoft buys tiktok, I doubt they would immediately transition away from Fastly.  So these two moving in opposite directions is odd. Don't companies usually drop in price when they buy expensive hot garbage?

If microsoft is anticipated to buy Tiktok, who gives a shit about a Facebook competitor? Is the user base expected to remain with tiktok and also use Facebooks platform for the same thing? 

TLDR: somethings fucky.Great, I bought high on both my AAPL and FB calls. Now I get to spend all weekend and next week hoping they pop enough to justify my bag holding.

I had a BABA debit spread purchased yesterday. 8/21 +255c, -265c.
BABA shit the bed today as most of us know. When it hit 248, I decided to buy back my short sell. +265C and realize the profits on it. It has since went back up to 252.  So while it has tanked I have managed to turn a profit on my calls. 

I lost my downside protection going forward, but assuming stonks only go up, and BABA does get back to 265 in the run up to earnings, I will make money on the call, and have secured a profit on my short call already today. 

This was a smart play assuming it goes up, Right?

Assuming it goes down, I increased my loss potential and in the end will lose more as a max loss. 

But overall, I just increased risk, and increased profit in true WSB fashion right?I need to get good and highYou guys think if I start a company that sells acid and advertise it as a space company and name it Virgin Galactic Holdings and go public, it'd reach a 10 billion marketcap?Who‚Äôs in

And even if he can't, can his EOs start working for weeks before they get ruled against in court?

The paint on your upper lip smells strange, but you feel beautiful. A young boy who spots you yells, ‚ÄúThe Tin Man!‚Äù You smile, but mumble to yourself *The Silver Man*. Still, you put a hand to your chest to check for a heart.

Suddenly you hear someone scream, ‚ÄúFreak!‚Äù You look up, and a boy on a skateboard is blazing towards you. You‚Äôre struck, then everything goes black.

Three days later, you awaken in a hospital. The doctor in the room looks concerned. ‚ÄúWhere did you get it?‚Äù Assuming she means your wounds, you answer: ‚ÄúA boy, on a skateboard.‚Äù She sighs, ‚ÄúNo, I mean the aluminum dust.‚Äù

You knew it was the best. For the look. To be a walking manifestation of your SLV calls. Like a devout follower‚Äîno, a prophet‚Äîyou wanted the world to know about the infinite power of silver. You nod and smile for several minutes.

Eventually, in response to your silence, the doctor says: ‚ÄúYour lungs are damaged beyond repair. You‚Äôll expire, worthless, by 8/14.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs become painfully clear that our government is completely lazy and woefully incompetent, yet you have retards dancing on the street with Biden and Trump hats and tshirts, screaming at each other about social bullshit while the government completely fucks everyone behind the scenes.

It's funny.

I fell for it once.

Don't be the retard that has 1 call contract for 5 green days, then go all in on the 1 red day and lose everythingI bought NFLX, AAPL, FB and NVDA calls today. They will all be green on Monday and double in value üòäWhen is Donnie going to shower us with executive order cash?AAPL 1000 EOMPretty obvious we are heading towards a dot com bubble. We can't keep going up 10% each month without a huge crash at the end. Don't be the sucker that has to bag hold for 10 years to break even. Take profitsI worked a $10k account into $25k just so I can avoid the PDT rule.

It's like a 20 year cycle.**advice needed**

So I‚Äôve been thinking of buying 1 share of AAPL and I know people say you should average in.. so is it smarter to just buy the 1 share or should I buy 100x  .01 fractional shares to get my average down? I don‚Äôt want to miss out on gains and want a lower cost.bears still in denial, SPY 420Fresh off a 15 day ban for goofing on Joe Biden.

People can justify it here because it's not video poker or slot machines, but I guarantee that if Zynga put out some shitty themed slot machine game that cost real money to play and you won real money, an epidemic of gambling addicts would be spawned.This whole idea of buying "stock" where you own an actual part of a company is archaic. Moving off the gold standard led to an economic boom in the US, and moving off the "company standard" for stocks will do the same.

This means that someone big (probably Ford himself) reached out to a reporter to get this story out and gauge reactions. Personally, I'm *extremely* doubtful this is going to happen, the least reason being that I've met Ford several times and who did he remind me of? Paul Jacobs and XCOM. Long story short, few years ago Jacobs came up with a harebrained idea to take QCOM private. He was basically laughed out and ejected from his chairman spot. 

This is the *exact* same setup - family scion thinks he can pull off the heist of the decade while actual investors laugh their asses off.

So why do I pick them for a reversal next week. 

&#x200B;

1. The stock trades in a 16-19 range, and reverse because it finds support. Pot is a nascent industry, everyone knows the big money comes in later years when its all legal, the key now is to position your company to exploit the legalization trend. This is a solid pot stock to own, because it is well positioned.
2. CGC reports on August 10th, if they‚Äôve executed their restructuring plan, then they will have a positive free cash flow story to report. it will be a moment for investors to consider CGC fundamentals rather than that of another pot company, which was the impetus for the current sell off.
3. Reversals just happen on general market euphoria as well, as in if we get stimulus derived optimism next week, it‚Äôs another out.
4. It‚Äôs called Canopy Growth Corp, not Canopy Losses Corp‚Ä¶.geez, they made it simpler for you to understandHe is playing class warfare card here.

Boomer investorsBig Money obviously rotating out of tech before the fall. Get with the program.Nasdaq bulls i‚Äôm sorry. You know if you read my posts I‚Äôm one of the biggest bears on here. I sold my amazon puts like 2 hours in before tech started tanking and bought Apple calls because I wanted to make money for once. Like clockwork, shit started tanking. Fucking hurts seeing amazon puts up 200%. Sucks missing out on 20k. Sucks being down 4K from switching to calls. My mental health is pretty good and I‚Äôm sure one day I‚Äôll make up for that, but jeez that shit hurts bad. 20k is life changing money for some people. Oh well.

I've only been trading for a few years, so my experience is pretty weak. But this has been the gayest 3 weeks of trading I've experienced. It was even lamer than the no volume melt up we had in Jan and Feb.The most similar recession I can find was the 1973- 1975 Oil Crisis Then we saw similar perceived ‚Äústagflation,‚Äù a stagnant economy with high inflationary practices and low consumer demand. To stabilize deflation the Fed rates were lowered which sent the 70s into its fabled era of inflation. That stretch too fro. 1973-1975 saw five quarters of negative GDP growth. We may see something similar. 

You stagflate an economy to combat rapid spiral deflation. Like we saw due to Covid. Or an Oil crisis.Since 08 rates however have been low already. So what is different here is that The Fed can't really lower rates, so stimulus is the only way to combat stagflation. The attempts at raising rates have lead to financial pain even in a "healthy" economy.

What if Q3-4 is dogshit too? What if the world sees a second Covid-19 wave? The Fed has iterated often that QE alone will not prop up the economy. This stimulus bill is more important than a lot of people realize for this reason. Without this bill the markets game of musical chairs stops and a lot of people will get left holding the bag.I believe that The Fed alone is very powerful, but has acknowledged that its not entirely responsible for holding markets together. Especially if it becomes clear that this isn't just a "flash" recession.

Im personally exhausted trying to fire off weeklies/monthlies to time the VIX ride up or the SPY put ride down but this is exactly when people should be parking longterm hedge or üåà üêª plays they plan to hold through the election. Especially if Q3-4 economic data is disappointing. Prepare for another massive deflationary event.https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/fed-wants-inflation-their-actions-are-deflationary

They are still growing and haven‚Äôt reached pre-coronavirus numbers yet. On LinkedIn they are hiring a ton of people on the corporate side and this week they rose 9%. They are estimated to beat earnings on 08/20. I would assume they are going to rise to $138-$140. This will be a great stock to jump into to hedge your bet against the potential tech bubble.

bad news for that betting service.How does BABA look for this coming week?So all the robinhood Facebook traders are talking about trvn, when do we want to hop on? I was thinking of buying some calls Monday at open and then shorting the fuck out of it when they inevitably dump it like all rh, fb meme stocksDon‚Äôt bring your girl to the markets next week.GREEN ON MONDAY, I AM MAKING MONEY!!!What‚Äôs the max amount you would keep in a single broker, be it for retirement/savings/whatever? 

No I‚Äôm not talking about robinhood I mean of the big boysHow is no one reporting on the intel leak, that shit is huge.i‚Äôm at a hilton in oak brook. weddings, bar open, pool bumpin, cheap rates.... why did i ever buy puts???????Real talk.... do you think Kayleigh fucked Trump to get the job? If not, do you think trump has at least grabbed her by the pussy[removed]Ok so on Monday I had officially lost everything in my account. Pretty depressing because although I make decent money with my day job, I don‚Äôt have anything in savings. My brokerage account was it. 

Devastated, I decided that I‚Äôm going to start over like a true autist. I deposited $100 back into my account, and set rules for myself. Obviously I don‚Äôt have the discipline to do this without clearly defined parameters for how I trade. 

My new goal is to turn that $100 into $1m by the end of October. 

My rules are essentially to trade only SPY, and only buy after significant movement in one direction or another. Sell once 20% gain is reached, or 20% loss. No exceptions. Never hold over night. No exceptions. 

I started this on Monday, and I‚Äôm proud to report that I have achieved the 20% goal each day. I‚Äôm now sitting at 199.98 in my account. I know, it‚Äôs not much, but I feel like I proved the concept. 

And hell, I doubled up in one week. Even though it‚Äôs only $200, that‚Äôs still something. 

Now, obviously, it‚Äôs one thing to do this with such a small amount, and another if/when I get to the point when I have major money on the line. I realize this. 

Anyway, I don‚Äôt feel devastated from my loss anymore. I feel like I have a plan and am executing‚Äîand that feels good. 

Maybe I reach my goal, maybe I don‚Äôt. But I‚Äôm up to the fucking challenge.

This is tied for my best week ever, but was tainted by some serious retardation by yours truly. 

On tilt from a negative week last week, on Monday I decided to chase CHGG during the runup through the day, then short it EOD. As is to be expected, the minute I bought calls the stock started a slow grind down, and when I sold the call for a loss and entered my short strangle position, the stock started to move up again. Worse, I entered at a far lower call strike than I had planned for. Bad llama! However, it worked out, as CHGG stayed roughly at that strike through the day and I cashed out with a significant profit Tuesday morning.

On another note, my "hold losers until expiry" strategy was put to the test this week, as SONO and FSLY both dumped heavily two days in a row, and DDOG turned from a wash into a loss. I will be reflecting on the wisdom of this particular strategy going into the weekend. More often than not this has worked in my favor, but not this time around.

I have now officially doubled my account value since starting this strategy 15 weeks ago, and am up 60% for the year. I am now 12/15 for positive weeks, with 2 losses of roughly 5% account value and 1 wash. As always, I skim my gains from the week to reset account value for Monday.

So while driving home after I picked him up from his girlfriend's house, I accidentally grabbed his leg instead of the gearstick. We both laughed and I unzipped his pants.

I started sucking his dick in the empty parking lot, and I almost choke because I'm laughing so fucking hard. My friend is also laughing his ass off too, because this is the greatest prank ever. He starts making train noises while yelling, ***"BROJOB! BROJOB! CHOO CHOO!"***. When he cums, I swallow it like I'm some big homo. I kissed him after and call him a big faggot while laughing.

The average Tiktok featured clip on a blank account has 1-3 million likes on the low end. 

I know it‚Äôs only been a few days for reels but that shows the core base of TikTok isn‚Äôt switching over to reels anytime soon. Reels is very jumbled and combined with Instagram. Which FB did because they didn‚Äôt want reels to fail immediately, but it will most likely dilute both Instagram and reels and make both less popular in the long run.I wanna be a millionaire by 30 but I‚Äôm not sure how likely that is to happen

Also-
SPY 340c 8/14Reposting(ish) my earlier comment with some edits. I want to know peoples opinion on this:

Something to consider.... you probably know this but commodity prices only move  during market hours because contracts for such commodities are only traded during this time. This means that price movements in gold and silver are mainly driven by speculators who are trading contracts for delivery, not actual physical purchases of the metals. Also consider that there are MORE CONTRACTS FOR GOLD DELIVERY than there is physical gold in the world, a sign that speculation is through the roof. If every person owning a gold contract requested delivery, banks would go bankrupt. (Also a sign of even sketchier shit going on behind the scenes involving banks who sell insane amounts of contracts and thus expose themselves to extreme risk)

this scares the fuck out of me. Any investment that is traded off of speculation is one that can have high exposure to volatility and bubbles. The safest bull scenario for gold becoming a good long term investment is people buying physical / taking delivery NOW. But unfortunately, physical purchases aren't factored into spot price, which i think is absolutely ridiculous. Its just people buying contracts (or the rights to gold). Don't you think if gold contract traders who are currently driving up the price truly saw value in gold would request immediate delivery? Instead they're holding these electronic contracts, IMO, in order to have easy access to liquidity / ability to turn around and resell their contracts in the short term. And thats not a good thing for the gold bull case.

what im concerned with is the fact that people are trading electronic contracts and not physical gold. Firstly, this makes it much more liquid which shouldn't be possible given the nature of gold.... what gives gold its value is that people want to hold onto it and they cant just go on a computer and press sell/buy on a whim. It is physical and hard to sell, which limits  supply and thus, according to microeconomic theory drives the price (and value) of gold. Electronic trading AND contracts add a lot more volatility to the mix and potential for "fake" value added in the short term. I am worried that contract owners (or most of them) are just speculators so they won't request delivery or else they would have already / just purchased physical instead. What if they just extend the contracts into further month in order to allow for more speculation and then sell the contracts all at once (without ever taking delivery) once they are satisfied with their short term gains? What do you think?


TLDR: gold price is driven by electronic traders/speculators, not actual gold proponents. it could be a in a bubbleBULLS R SO FUKNot options related, but key lesson about selling too early. When I was in Uni in Toronto 2014 I found a bunch of recently listed weed stocks, one of which was tweed (which is CGC now). I was super bullish about legalization in the future, and loaded up everything I had saved into shares when they were ~$.60-.70 . 
My plan was to hold for years, but I went against my own thesis selling around $1.20 impulsively bc I was so proud to spot it early and make a great gain like that so quickly. It ended up running to the $70‚Äôs (hnng) during the run up to legalization in Canada 4 years later. Really put me in a dark place for a bit at the time knowing I could have changed my whole life by just being more patient, putting ego aside.
Anyways, it was a hard lesson to learn and made me better today in the end bc I can let these growth stocks that I believe in actually rise and play out, avg up etc without being controlled by emotion.

When you think you gotta take a dump, so you walk 3 stories down to the porta John and all you do is fucking fart.No stimulus talk, and low likely hood of Trump signing an Executive order.. How likely is red Monday?Something to consider.... As you know, commodity prices only move  during market hours because contracts for such commodities are only traded during this time. This means that price movements in gold and silver are mainly driven by speculators who are trading contracts for delivery, not actual physical purchases of the metals. Also consider that there are MORE CONTRACTS FOR GOLD DELIVERY than there is physical gold in the world, a sign that speculation is through the roof. If every person owning a gold contract requested delivery, banks would go bankrupt. (Also a sign of even sketchier shit going on behind the scenes involving banks who sell insane amounts of contracts and thus expose themselves to extreme risk)

As a gold proponent, this scares the fuck out of me. Any investment that is traded off of speculation is one that can have high exposure to volatility and bubbles. The safest bull scenario for gold becoming a good long term investment is people buying physical / taking delivery NOW. But unfortunately, physical purchases aren't factored into spot price, which i think is absolutely ridiculous.My NBA moneyline parlay on Draft Kings:

Awesome.Holding options over the weekend is like holding onto a rope that's tied to a bull's nut sack,

and you're hanging off a cliff's edge,

but the rope is burning in the middle, 

and you're desperately yanking on that motherfucker to motivate the bull to drag you up before it's too late, 

and the bull is in tremendous pain because you're over-leveraged, 

and on days like today it skids back and it's barely holding up you and your fat bags, 

but the bull is groggy from being injected with so much liquidity, 

so it suddenly falls asleep at 4pm on Friday, 

and you get dragged further down as its pumped up body gets dragged farther,

but it gets caught on a boulder,

so now you're hanging there,

and the rope's still burning,

waiting for Monday when you can yank on that motherfucker with all your might once again,

hoping the hungry theta crocodiles at the bottom,

don't claim another victim.

I never owned Tesla. Cannot afford it's shares BUT this company is gonna destroy Uber and Lyft. 

So Tesla is gonna launch a rideshare app and let Uber drivers get their cars and drive them with $ down and pay it while working. 

So it will also offer insurance and stuff making it much better for drivers as they save. Riders will love it cuz their in new nice cars. 

Win win. Uber and Lyft dead. Tesla dominates a market AND all the rideshare cars will be Tesla's so alot more cars sold.

But that's fucking stupid says the gallery. Well, not entirely. If the price dips enough, leaps are definitely a good gamble. Why? Because multiple OEMs are trying to dip their toes in the fuel cell game. Toyota, Honda, Mercedes just off the top of mind.

NKLA presents a chance to test the tech out in civilian hands without risking the brand damage. All the data and tweaks can be done through a minority stake/partnership at a fraction of what a full in house program will cost. There's rumors around of partnerships and whatever though nothing concrete. One of those will pan out.

I know, Trevor is a moron and the hype pricing at $99 was ridiculous. But the concept is one manufacturers have been drooling over for decades and will be tested once and for all. It wasn't just retards that pumped it; big money sees the potential too.

Most definitely not worth more than 10% of portfolio, if that, and I'm still not 100% set but something to think about.What if: the worst thing for the market isn‚Äôt more things going wrong but a few things going a little bit right?

Let‚Äôs say there‚Äôs signs of recovery in a sector other than tech. Money quickly rotates out of tech into the other sector. Tech drops so fast that people panic sell and everything sells off to like 280 or something.

I wanted to let her know that I actually saw the video she was talking about(if you go through my post history, I probably still have the comment up mentioning that an escort I saw was on porn hub), but I thought that would make things weird lol. she let me take pictures that didn‚Äôt show her face because ‚Äúyou‚Äôre cool‚Äù, and she didn‚Äôt ask for any extra money.

I'm planning on selling an online course for men or women who are married to a woman. The course would teach them my secret method for making women addicted to anal sex. (When I say "addicted" I mean it. These women need anal sex daily. If they don't get it, they start feeling withdrawal -- depression, anxiety, even physical aching.) I will tell you what I'll tell my prospective customers about the method: it takes 48 hours of isolation from other people and electronic devices. It does not involve any pain, drugging or non-consensual touching. You have to be prepared to have a wife who is truly addicted to anal, and that is a big responsibility. 

The course would include a workbook, 37-minute video, and instructions for making a small drink coaster out of regular printer paper. (The coaster is used in the process.)

I'm not sure about pricing. I have never revealed this method to anyone -- in the past I have charged men $4000 and up to carry out the process on their wives. What do you think people would be willing to pay? Do you think there is a market? How do I avoid being pirated and having my materials end up on PirateBay?Everyone saying Monday is green.

üêª üêª üêªHey guys I found WSB on a personalfinance comment.

Anyways would I be better off investing in options compared to, say, setting my money in SPY or VTSAX? Looking for 10% returns annually.

What are your thoughts guys? How profitable are options? Thanks.We‚Äôre In the Midst of a Massive Bust
David Hunter, the chief macro strategist at Contrarian Macro Advisors, believes that the economy is in the midst of a massive ‚Äúbust‚Äù consisting of two phases.

We are now in the first phase, which consists of the initial bear market and short-lived recovery.

The second phase of the bust, which Hunter expects to take place in late 2020 or early 2021, will see a much steeper downturn than the first phase.

The stock market could drop 80% due to prolonged economic damages. Gold could hit $2,300 an ounce this year and $10,000 by the end of the decade.

Stocks continue to defy gravity, but the liftoff could be short-lived as economic realities sink in. Gold, on the other hand, appears poised to continue climbing


* Both the S&P 500 and gold are hitting new highs.
* The stock market could drop by 80% as the economy struggles to emerge from the pandemic. Gold could hit $2,300 this year.
* We shouldn‚Äôt expect a vaccine to be the cure to all the economy‚Äôs problems.
The U.S. stock market keeps rising despite rising virus cases and a sloppy recovery. 

The S&P 500 has rallied by more than 45% since hitting bottom on March 23.

There‚Äôs strong reason to believe that the rally is not sustainable and that equities could collapse soon.What did you guys think of the new Cardi B video ? ü•µüí¶üí¶FirstHmm why would Bezos just sell $3.1 billion worth of Amazon stock?Why do I get the feeling monday is going to be red af.

Nano Particles....Anyone know what they are?  Anyone know the potential uses in the Biological realm? Anyone know they can be created by man and be engineered to produce specific results in the human body?

Why is a tech titan like Bill Gates involved in the vaccine.  He's not a boiologist or doctor or immunologist. Could it be that He knows alot about nano-tech? Nano sized pathways, and the like?

Soon everyone will be required to have a vaccine that no one knows much about.

That‚Äôs where unions and working hours and weekends came fromYeah UBI is inevitable when machines replace low skilled workers in the future. 

As a software dev, I strongly support UBI or people gonna hang us for writing stuff that replaces them in the next revolution.It's not even Brrr.  Imagine eliminating the inefficiencies by having separate welfare, unemployment, Social Security etc. departments.  Just one UBI Dept and everyone with a SS number over a certain age gets it.  Roll all the tax money from the cancelled shit into UBI, eliminate the SS max and you are well on your way to funding it.  It would also serve as a stimulus to states and municipalities because the spend a shit ton on administering unemployment and welfare.  Tier the new tax so that over a certain threshold ($150k +) you are paying more than you receive.  The time to do something like this is in a recession and deflationary environment.

Sucks for the redundant gov workers but at least they will get UBI.  You can't reduce inefficiencies and guarantee jobs.

Also decreases the conservative viewpoint of "they are lazy and don't deserve it" when everyone is getting it.In before supply side jesus shows upHory fukWelcome to America bitches.

If I got enough to pay all debts, I'd be out of high risk shitI make 100% gains some days and I'm pissed I didnt make more.

If he's an adult and he's leaving his socks all over the floor, leaving dirty dishes, hangs his towels or outfit over a door, leaves his trash lay around, doesn't put his laundry in the hamper, and cant/won't cook for himself... he's not gonna change or get better. 

Be careful of lvm pretending to be high value. Some will fool you even with vetting. Always pay attention to how they keep their place. I had one fake having a clean nice apartment the first time. When he was asleep check his fridge or pantry to see if is actual food and groceries, or just condiments and fast food trash. Check his shower when you're in the bathroom see if its actually dirty or if he uses actual soaps rather than just 3 in 1 or bar soap.

Right now I'm just assuming we nuke ourselves to death long before we manage to escape our miserable isolated imprisonment on this planet but you never know.i almost died a couple years ago and one thing i was legit upset about was not being able to see the upcoming movies and shows and games i had been looking forward to.  i live a normal balanced life and see the sunshine every day like a normal person but tech has us by the balls manDon‚Äôt be mad about dying, be happy you got to be alive at such a critical point in tech development bro. 

The pace at which we‚Äôre advancing is just mind boggling. Imagine if you‚Äôd been born in ancient times or something where the development of tools and tech was much slower. You could have used the same type of bow and arrow your forefathers used, grown old, died, and your grandkids still been using the same tech. 

We only make fun of boomers and people who can‚Äôt turn on a computer because these last few years tech has advanced faster than our ability to adjust. That‚Äôs scary, and amazing, and it‚Äôs a really neat time to be alive.

Companies have no loyalty to you, don't have any to them.Tell them it pays 40% more and don't look back. Nobody will care in two weeksTake a shit on your boss's desk.Hello bossman? Ya I quitYou can be honest and give them a chance to beat the offer. If they can‚Äôt come up 40%+, that‚Äôs on them now, not you, and you guys can each go your own way. Or they do come up.

Or lie and tell them you are taking care of a sick relative.Just go to HR and kindly tell them that you just received an offer that you simply could not refuse and it is inline with your career goals. Definitely apologize and thank them for their time. The shit that goes into onboarding new people can be a bit tedious. You also don't want to burn bridges, so if you think you can get along well with your current boss, maybe invite them out for drinks or so. You never know they will help you down the road.My brother is a doctor, and had a large team of nurses throughout the hospital and they all had a good relationship with the director and the owner of the hospital. The second that people started coming in less to the hospital because of COVID the hospital fired half of the nurses and ‚Äúreduced hours‚Äù for the other half. Fuck the company. Loyalty is for a company that respects you.Congrats! Just quit. Don‚Äôt think twice about it. They won‚Äôt think twice about you. No offense.dont take a shit on your boss's desk before you leave"Hi boss. I know I just started, but I got another offer for 40% higher pay. Do you want 2 weeks notice, or should I just leave?"

Nobody is going to think you're an ass for leaving for better pay. If they do, they're just jealous so fuck em.Just quit as apologetically as possible, accept the fact that some of them will think you're an asshole, then wipe your tears with hundred dollar bills like Woody HarrelsonHonestly, if it's not a bridge you aren't unwilling to burn, at the absolute maximum just put in your two weeks. If you don't care, just quit outright. You're making a business decision. Do what a business would do to you if it was the other way around.

I'm pretty callous after the factory I work at laid off half their workforce, a lot of those people having been there since the place opened 10 years ago. They helped build it to be what it is now.

I wasn't one of the one laid off, and I understand these things happen in the business world from time to time, but the way they went about it was such shit. Upper management knew for months this was coming. Didn't give anyone an ounce of notice. Just said everyone needs to come in on a Saturday, split us into 2 groups, and axed everyone in one of the groups. Just like that.

This from a company that touts the whole "we're a family, we're all in this together" attitude.

Does that count as give and DD cause then yeah man, just do itIt's 50/50 at times. If it's something I dont have much knowledge or research, I'll do my DD especially if it's something that looks interesting.

The other night I dreamed I was being scanned by aliens and there was nothing I could do. It was the weirdest sensation.

Unless.... ü§îI get it 2-3x every other month.I get it rarely...once every 3-4 years. It's not as severe as other descriptions I've read, and is usually feels more like I'm too sleepy/tired to move (rather than physically being unable to move my body -- I don't even try to), except my eyelids. I open my eyes, but do not (cannot?) move the rest of my body. This is where it gets freaky. Because I'm half asleep at this point, my dreams turn into hallucinations. I usually am aware I'm on my bed. But everything else is strange. My clothes aren't what I wore. There are objects in the bedroom that shouldn't be. And I don't bother even moving, just accepting all the strangeness around me.Yo dude. Do you have sleep apnea?  For real get testedMy lawyer friends who abused adderral in law school have sleep paralysis pretty regularly.I had it the night I played with a Ouija board.

Half the time I end up jumping out of bed so fast only to realize I hallucinated the whole thing.

I guess I will be ok for rest of my life dealing with traffic and bartender being late serving meWhen I see crowds in a movie or tv show, they look weird now, like how can a big group of people gather like that without masks?

I abandoned news years ago. It's funny listening to people who consider themselves "informed" about current events. They're usually worked up over some issue that I'm oblivious to. I'm not especially smart or wise at all, but listening to "informed" people attempt to explain their understanding of the world is like listening to a fearful, angry child.Never is a long timeDon‚Äôt think they are a great investment.

This of course probably won't stop him from doing it anyway. 



The plan of not negotiating, stealing the dems plan, calling it his idea, and forcing them to sue him over doing their plan is evil genius level shit that I'm glad he wasn't smart enough to do more often.Certainly, he can do it.  The question is will democrats challenge the EO in court?  It would seem unwise to challenge an order that will be providing massive financial relief to people struggling through no fault of their own.  But, then again, it's hard for me to predict what the dem's will do, since their point of view tends to be completely alien to me.It's a last resort measure.

It's all a massive bluff.How do you check M2 values? The fed definitely seems to think deflation is a bigger potential threat than inflation. I think fears about inflation are valid based on anecdotal rising prices and endless money printing, but macro-economics can get weird, so who knows.Yeah recessions are inherently a deflationary event; the whole purpose of quantitative easing is to discourage that trendShould be fun. Keep an eye on dxy this month. Tuesday next week let's goooo.Yes this isn't the same as the 1970s. We can't lower rates any more and we politically won't be able to continue passing stimulus. 

Recession was being hinted before Covid struck. March was so bad because it coalesced with a natural market correction event. 

I think we repeat that in the next 6 months.WSB is very bullish rn so ima just leave this here lowkey

These past 2 weeks, the Fed has been decreasing their liquidity injections into mortgage backed securities. This week, it was - $21 billion. More homeowners are expected to miss their mortgage payments this month. 

If the Fed doesn‚Äôt keep propping up the housing market, and as mortgage backed securities become less promising investments due to homeowners missing mortgage payments, investors are going to sell off their securities. 

The investment institutions that depend on those investors to fund mortgage loans on homes will be holding the bag. These investment institutions may also be banks, which have been tightening the amount of loans they‚Äôve been giving out due to risk in this economy. 

So, if investment banks are starting to lose liquidity bc Fed won‚Äôt prop up securities, and less investors want to provide funding for mortgage loans, and less revenue is coming in from interest on loans bc of tightening restrictions on who can get loans from banks, then how will these banks raise cash? 

Selling equities, raising demand for the dollar oOo 
I‚Äôm keeping an eye on the reversal of DXY if the trend continues 

Also, Fed has been decreasing liquidity swaps with foreign banks for a while now since like April. Those banks have probably been investing those USD into stonks. What happens if foreign banks want more dollars in their area but the Fed won‚Äôt swap with them? They get grumpyyy

They don‚Äôt make em like that anymoreKinda.  Even if you have enough money for all that jazz, you certainly could pick something better to do.You need help. Degenerate gambler.

Uncut Gems is better as a movie than real life shitSome could be fake, but it's a slippery slope.  You first make some money.  More than you could in say a few weeks or month working a decent job.  You then lose a little.  Then lose a little more.  Then lose half of your initial investment or most.  So you deposit more.  Then you lose more.  When you add up the losses it is more than you make in a few weeks or months or more working a decent job.  Only way to make up for it is to deposit more. Rinse and repeat until nothings left but the fear and bitter sting of having to tell someone who it'll deeply effect negatively.  Greed is a powerful drug but the ego is strongerI assume 99% of it is sarcasm but you never can tell here...Gambling addictsI lost half my life savings about 30k. Im not married with no kids soAt this point I wouldn't be surprised if landlords start saying no repairs, utilities are shut off and I'm not paying taxes or my mortgage.

Like, what, if you set a goal of buying a yacht, and then you reach it, that means you go cash gang for the rest of your life?buy low sell highMain goal: Make money.

Side goal: If enough money is made, buy a 4wd van, outfit it to do the vanlife, sell house, quit job, drive around to my heart's content for however long I care to. 

And if I really wanna live the pipe dream, make enough money to buy land, have a 100% off the grid, self sustaining house built, then do the van thing.House down payment or retireCrom, grant me REVENGE!!!Pay off about 25k in debt.

Lmao Fook üòπüòπWhat‚Äôs a skimboardStop losses and don‚Äôt put too much into one positionHas also happened to me since july.I just started selling the options rather than buying them. Seems to be working so far.Only make long term plays and don't open the app for a few days. Obviously you got paper hands but if you just go long and forget about it stonks only go upBe patient and make less trades and don't doubt ur vibe unless new information comes outPull all your money and take a break for a couple of weeks. Things will be better when you come back with a clear head. Every trader has these periods. What makes a good trader stand out is acknowledging that you aren't at your best and need a break. And keeping your losses small while letting winners run. Easier said than done though.Ahh.... You've got the bug. Sorry to break it to you. You're gay.But does it even matter in the face of deflation‚ùì

I feel like I need a Rosetta Stone to decipher it sometimes, but we‚Äôre clearly dealing with a massive intellect.I hope so, historically the recovery after the election turmoil has been strong af, time to buy that fucking dipBought VXX Calls for October out of fear....  I think the Sept/Oct months is a good time for a collapse as well, those $600 Unemployment checks, Eviction Moratoriums, and PPP Loans were the only thing keeping the mainstreet economy afloat, and now they're all GONE!  Even if they pass an extension, it won't kick in for another couple of weeks, I heard, so folks will possibly lose out on a whole month of enhanced unemployment and may not make rent for Sept; all the while they practically stop spending for all of August and buy only groceries, hurting small businesses even further......The one girl is also a guy.Bro how you gonna put in 12k and not get the ticker right?

You buy even shorter dated call options, and I mean a lot. like a fuk ton.  That way if the stock goes up, you profit.  If it goes down, you can then really confirm you are a retard. I don't even know what stock we are talking about.Bill Murray would be indifferent.Drank $CLXShe's still active on Twitter so I guess she didn't short $ROPEFinal call into $ROPE is my guess.Prpl Judas sold you all out for his slv piecesWho do you think was selling those calls?!Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.

The recovery built off of after hours gap ups and amazingly well timed fed announcements? The record outflows from hedge funds? The small handful of companies now accounting for most of SPYs valuation? 

Yet somehow it feels like the bubble cant burst. It feels like it's more likely that this will go on forever than ever correct even though it's clear the valuations are disconnected I still find myself wanting to buy calls

A). Everywhere else is shit to keep money. Besides Metals.

C). Lots and Lots of foreign money pouring into to escape financial crises unfolding internationally.

Yes the entire recovery is based on The Fed backstopping the market and the emphasis that rates won't go up until 2022. If The Fed ever decides to raise rates or if we enter a financial crisis there is a perceived loss of control from The Fed, the selloff would be monstrous.They can create money, but it doesn't go anywhere.

They're trying to create a perception of a wealth effect and inflation at the same time.  It's a mass hallucinationHave faith brother.

Personally I‚Äôm a fan of MSFT, the reach they have into the infrastructures of major corporations via azure alone is superb.They don't care about things that aren't headlines, I'd be surprised if your average cable news junkie knows how much is being spent and on whatIts aviation that is dragging them down. Even so it should be closer to $10.Yeah their revenue is high. But their margins are low and costs are way too bloated.I think it's that Jet Engine business that's dragging them down about now.Do you have covid bruhü§´ let me consolidate my LEAPs before you spill the beans.This made me and my MSFT calls smileIs this bullish for metals.65, 1.30 round trip$0.65/contractWhat are the benefits of TOS?Never read a 10-k in my lifeThis is my research, inverse the loudest voice on WSB.No dude that‚Äôs too much work I just spam comments and look for shit that supports my calls*Survive a zombie apocalypse with this one weird trick**Directors hate him*BRB, ordering dom suits.Too rich to care ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èAnd tell the people their taxes will be lowerTwo party system.

Seriously they've been whining for the past couple of days and now ended up jumping onto OTRK.  I don't think they see the possibilities of what this new Teledoc could end up becoming in the long run.  They just wanted Livongo all by themselves to double each month, LOL.  To me personally Livongo could have run out of steam eventually but with the overseas reach that Teledoc has, they know can help more people.  Just my two cents.

Thanks!"EOW"Employees... hes in Bedminster at his golf clubBecause billionairesBut inflating assets is a deep rooted tradition!hah.  simple solutions would work and save the country.  can‚Äôt have that.Increasing the minimum wage without also putting restrictions on automation and importing undocumented workers just makes those jobs go away. 

Bernie's plan accounted for that by restricting those things, anyone else talking about wage increases is blowing smoke up your ass if they don't include those things.The thing is job numbers show that if people can work they will. It went up and not down while they were receiving bonus. theres no truth to people not returning to work if they have something to return toIncreasing minimum wage will make employers hesitant to hire. Also, corps will have more automation if they raise minimum wage. I‚Äôm amazon factories, almost everything is automated already especially rates are at 0 anywayTo $140 hour?

MSFT I like depending where you bought. Also thinking AMD won't run that high. DOCU is solid.

You're gonna live and die by tech so hope you bought today. I've finally started getting into NVAX, QDEL, and SLV, not to mention some very cheap INTC.The AMD, ATVI, and MSFT probably all feel nice but all could very easily trade flat for a whileAmd has shown great resilience, I think 90 has a chance. Although I sold amd 100c 9/18 (which don‚Äôt).  

7.3/11 on the rest.AMD would scare me with those expiry dates, hate buying calls in a company that has had such a massive run up just recently, especially considering it‚Äôs not a small cap company, great long term but those are the only ones I‚Äôd be iffy on. 

Also the MSFT calls are too dependent on trump‚Äôs mood and China posturing for me to be in. Sold out my 9/11 215c‚Äôs for a 120% profit, kinda regretting it though.I‚Äôm also in ATVI & MSFT but for 8/14... they were doing well until today now I‚Äôm bag holding.

Just praying that MSFT announces the Tik Tok deal and they have a good run next week. As for ATVI I don‚Äôt even know, I was hoping after they smashed earnings and increased guidance they would go up, but apparently that‚Äôs not how it works.Everybody playing MSFT should realize the TikTok thing is not a done deal. Also in general MSFT doesn't move much right, even when they are crushing earnings. So its little upside and plenty downside (they give back the 10% they just got from the announcement).JACKEDFirm handshakes all aroundEveryone realized they have nothing proprietary, they are a dime a dozen service.I should‚Äôve sold when it was 110. Wiped out all my gainsIf you got the balls, hold tight. I see the TikTok ban getting reversed in the next 2 weeks.

Plus, people don't grasp that it's summer, this is the lowest point of the year. Flu season doesn't start til late Fall. Once Flu season starts people are indoors and spreading it. The only reason it's spiked in the south now is cause with the extreme heat people stay indoors, while the rest of the country is outdoors. Come the Fall it will be 10X worse. Even if vaccine comes, it will take months to deploy. Rest of the year is FK'd.

People who are trading the travels stonks now will be FK'd. They ain't going to hold them for a year, they are just trading them short term. They won't stay up until institutional investors come in. They won't come in until the vaccine is deployed. You're buying them at least 3 month ahead of any chance of a vaccine approval.

I agree. some form of a secondary stimulus will pass, but listen to this

1) If it is too late, market will correct

2) if it is too little, market will correct

3) if it goes the way of TARP in 2008 (up for a vote and fails) market will BIGLY correctThe bullish-ness that people don't realize is the current monetary and fiscal policy. Ultra-low rates, newly "printed" money flooding into the system juicing the money supply.You hear yourself right? Eventually this falls

MY CAPS LOCK WON'T TURN OFF, SRRY.Yes, fed just announced this week that they‚Äôll ramping inflation. It‚Äôs gonna run up for next 1-4 weeks b4 pausing a bityes. volatility is high though so expect some erratic price action.Probably not if the dollar keeps going up but I'm prone to panicking and have gold callsSilver will run even higher once economy opens upI think so too. Not gonna be a straight line though, lots of gain 5% one day, lose 3% the next.Demand is growing, supply is dwindling. Covid shutdown a lot of silver miners if reports can be believed. Which in this case I surprisingly think they're true. Couple that with silver supply having already been falling for the past few years, I'm really hoping we hit a point where demand greatly outpaces supply.

Everytime I make a play based on something stupid like "I like the color purple - PRPL it is!" I end up making a profit.They can‚Äôt even set a budget üîõ timeDepends on who is getting assailed by constituents. Each side has made an ultimatum for coming back to the table. The other side has said the terms of those ultimatums are a non-starter. Only significant external pressure could affect them now. Donnie is happy to sign and EO he says, now pushed to next weekend after threatening it this weekend. I think his EO is toothless, which is why he pushed it back a week when his bluff was called. But i dont think his bluff was actually called, as the Dems made significant concessions to look for a compromise in good faith. While the WH side stonewalled and failed to understand how negotiating works, other than this we have EOs bullshit. If the EO threat were true Trump would have used it already, as the sides are so far apart. The longer this drags on the more the WH is losing. They cannot message for shit, and the Senate swing state GOP is who will start feeling pressure and push McConnell to open talks instead. Trump would then be left in a position to veto a deal which would kill any hope of re-election because the reality is we need more assistance to survive. If no pressure on GOP reps and senators from constituents, then no deal for weeks and we fucking have a distaster. Schools are so fucked RN and 3w left before they normally are back. That means 3w left until working parents are fucked. Which means 3w left until productivity crashes and economy slows rapidlyTrump to issue EO pronto.  Specifics were given in his press conference last night.  Democrats won't challenge in court.  Imagine them trying to prevent millions of desperate Americans from receiving financial relief during a pandemic.  Not a good look before an election.It's a done deal.

USA GDP in 2018 was $20T. Let's say US GDP grows 3% per year until 2030, that's $36T.

So you are basically looking for Apple alone to be half of USA total GDP. If you add in the rest of FAANG at the same rate you're looking at FAANG being valued well above US total annual GDP.Noooooo.    Bro, every bull market has different leaders.

I was down 5%What price you buy atIPO's tend to make money their first two days, with profit taking at the end. On the plus side after profit taking they tend to go parabolic. I would hold at least through Monday. Cannot guarantee it. But it is the standard I use for good ones. And This one is a good one. Godspeed bro!I always use VIX as a hedge not as an actual play, but to each his own brotherI gave up on VIX last week hahaBABA 270c 8/21 is bold...good luck sir.AA? Alcoa Corp?

Means all that dip I bought is gonna print 100%.$SLV bout to Iron Condor through end of year famI've been holding ANTH for yearsthe gay bears got me down :( Hoping tech rallies next week :(honestly FDs are the way to go. Everytime i try to be responsible and buy something a month+ out i get shit on within 5 minutes of opening a position. Not even worth it to me anymore. All about smaller buy ins with high speculation and short time frames from now on for mePeople shit on FDs but they‚Äôre good if you have discipline. Don‚Äôt be fucking greedy and you won‚Äôt get wreckedI saw FB go up today and told myself I wouldn't look at it again until close, to prevent myself from selling if it dipped in the AM. It went way up really quickly, but as soon as they said there was no stimulus, it fucking tanked. Such bullshit, if not for that it could've easily kept going till 290 by EOD. I was up 20x on some contracts, and 10x on others. Now I'm down 30%.We see where your priorities areLmao. She‚Äôs still fucking you. Mr. Blutarsky. Zero POINT zero.They end that early Fridays?Last week for me. Still way down and still buying options instead of stocks and lost money today but i think im on the right-er trackSame with my ATVI call debit spreads in the middle of the week. It said the farther OTM call was worth 0.01DUDE MY CALLS ARE DA SAMEIV continues to climb higher and higher because they are about to run.Bid-ask fuckerySame honestly pIf it makes you feel better I threw like 3k at 8/14 445C eod.Keep buying double every time and eventually you‚Äôll make moneyCan‚Äôt exactly call it getting cucked when I made money on FB calls today, but I‚Äôm way ITM 252.5c 9/11 expiration, unrealized.

"This great toolkit does not include a printing press, rather **because it doesn‚Äôt it has** instead been stocked..."That article talks about how credit spreads are equivalent to the 2018 correction as if that's a bad thing lol. Obviously, without J Pow those would be waaaay higher. Literally the only thing of value that article contains is credit standard increasing for banks are a bad sign, and even that argument has an easy counter to it.Hopefully they will fix it on Monday open.Is it though? Tesla would be extremely bullish if in another universe it had a slower burn up to $1000 right now. So, if drops to $1000, aggregately, it‚Äôs still had an insane year...

Not that I would ever bet against Tesla.Give it a bit. That Trump order on Tencent sent it down, plus some panic selling.  I‚Äôm still in till bustATVI just having bad luck. Best ER, but shitty websites gave bad and fake ER data. Then they start to recover only for trump to ban TenCent who owns 10% stake in ATVI. If you have 9/18+ I'd hold or you could avg down. Bad times rn.Not having stimulus is bullish because the market gets to look forward to stimulus. Then it can sell the news when stimulus actually happensI‚Äôm not so sure about thatMonday will be green my childFree?Should have bought JNUG callsWe just had 6 consecutive Green Days....For today???I do tho TSLA 900 next week would be wildI think it's a glitchIt's up .32%Cuz they retard lolPlaced order at lower price then market value at an earlier time.

The uncertainty of whether it will be due later means most companies will just keep the money instead of passing it on to their employees. 

Good for them because they can invest that money but not for the employee.Lol not having the power to do something has never stopped a US government official. What do you think this is, pre marbury v madison america?The answer is maybe.

IF Trump advises employers that they are not required to send in the money, they may just withhold it and not send it.  There is no guarantee the employee sees the money.

The employer may worry that they'll still need to send in the money later.  Payroll tax deferral would have to come with a guarantee the tax will be forgiven.  The system is not really setup for Trump to issue an order like this - he can order a delay to when taxes are due.  But thats of limited help.yup the way he's stating this, that'd mean a huge bill to pay for ppl later unless Congress authorizes it. I don't think this will be passed to ordinary folksBasically it means more money printing.It‚Äôs not due later retard, it will just resumeYes he does have the power. It's under the same provision that he used to postpone the tax deadline.Coherent, at leastIf you don't vote for me you aint Chinese ü§ôüòéü§ôKnowing his past relations with China he would almost certainly suck up to their every demand.They give him and his kid money and they do whatever tf they wantHe would have flashbacks to fighting them in WWII.

WORK ER is coming up the week after, it has a lot of space to run to reach it's ATH, which is possible due to their deal with AMZN that was announced in their last ER. It dropped after the ER because they declined to provide any guidance.

I have calls for both. I don't have plans to hold through the ER.

Options market don‚Äôt impact real market that much.

I have a weird feeling China is going to retaliate for the Trump banning TikTok and WeChat.But what goes up does not have to come back down, and any stock in motion can be acted upon by non greek represented factors like when Marathon's refinery caught fire and they were rumored to not be able to find a buyer for another asset.

But you right tho1.6 million unpaid internships at trump industries . Really the best, nobody else could have done something so tremendous. We will beat this China virusi dont think they are producing that level of detail. they cant even properly categorize what is really unemployed vs employed.

there is one statistic that may be helpful and that is the avg. hourly income which was +.2% vs -.7% which indicates that the jobs were of better quality and higher payingDon't forget how many people fell out of the workforce and reporting.  Skews the numbers as well.  I don't want to spoil it for you.Someone on here said like 400k of it was government furloughs returning to work.Pay attention to the indexes whenever you hold calls through earnings. The news is just an excuse to justify and blame external causes, when in fact there's insane selling pressure now that the Nasdaq and Spy had 7 straight green days to ATH. 

I wanted to play earnings too but I asked myself is there more potential for further overall market upside? Or is their greater potential for a first red day, correction/profit taking on any news after a great run up and so many straight green days.Almost every non mega cap tech stock that ran up massively into earnings dumped or stayed flat post er.I doubled down. I hv faith.Picked up Jan 90c's after fridays overreaction. Got a nice discount on itI've been thinking about this too.

Basically allow people to gamble by app, but just alias options e.g Betting on black is betting on spyHave you met my friend loot boxesum, they already exist. Many state run lotteries have mobile games using real money.Imagine they made mobile stonks illegalI'm just high enough to understand this. Well done.I'm in. I want 100 shares.I think what you‚Äôre trying to describe is TeslaIf you're not sure about kids. Dont have them.

They cost time, money, and energy. If you don't have any of those 3 things it gets significantly harder.

Don't regret having mine. Was bummed about taking a 10k L today  but felt better after spending time with the little one.

"Sorry bud daddy blew part of your college fund but its okay we'll get them next time."No regrets at all. But it's a lot, so it's not a decision to be taken lightly either.You're not gonna regret it.  Take the leap.Not even think, kids are the best you could have in your life, yeah, you think otherwise when under 30s, but man once 50s, they are the reason and purpose of your life....It is very difficult. The jump from one to two has been even harder than I thought because it is literally non stop all day every day. There are no real breaks. My guy friends are a thing of the past because they‚Äôre all still single. I almost never golf or fish by myself anymore. I‚Äôm awake right now because I‚Äôm waiting for my one year old to stop crying on his own instead of going in and rocking him back to sleep because that‚Äôs more likely to make tomorrow‚Äôs wake up shorter. 

But the hardest thing about going from 1 to 2 is that my four year old is so fucking cool that I‚Äôm ready to be traveling and camping with him. He likes to do everything I do. He wants to work on everything. He can legit fish by himself. He learned to swim in like a week. He gets furious if I pee without him. 

Your relationship needs to be stable because there is very little time to patch over rough spots once this happens. All insecurities and incompatibilities you were able to gloss over get exposed big time. 

But I‚Äôm turning the corner. My boys are beautiful and they are hilarious. It won‚Äôt be long before they are the ones pushing to play golf, go camping, go canoeing, etc. it‚Äôs happening with the four year old already. Covid has been the best because professional fathers have never been able to spend this much time with their children. I cannot imagine anyone ‚Äúregretting‚Äù having kids. Struggling?  For sure. But struggle is life. You adapt, overcome and grow just as much as they do. It‚Äôs pretty amazing really.Not if you're a man. Women, yup: 39-47 limit. Men? Make some more money and do whatever you want. Nannies aren't that expensive and you can have or not have kids whenever you want (or don't want).

Money helps: a few dollars and you can do whatever you want at any age.i don't think i've ever heard anyone saying they regret having kids. i've heard plenty of people say that marriage wasn't worth it but kids wereHaving kids is a losing game, more unknown variables than holding 0dte FDs. Mad respect to all parents out there.I'm in the other camp. I know I would regret having kids. 

That said, all the people in my life who have had kids don't regret it.

I've just always known I don't want kids, just like people who wants kids pretty much all say they've always known they wanted to be a mother/father.They make more than their salaries playing options anyway.Is it really a good jobs report?It wasn‚Äôt a good jobs reportTf does paying for gas with cash doMake sure it's the decent dog food.

And now I have antibodies.I did, apparently mine were worse than the guy who keeps posting "wasn't shit"

Got over it but there were a few nights that I was legitimately scared to go to sleep because my throat was so swollen.  Had a fever around 102 for 10 days or so, bad stomach issues.

Edit*  I'll toss in that I'm in my 30's and am an athlete.  I could easily see it really fuckin up people who aren't used to being on the side of a mountain 250+ days a year.Cousin got it along with her 2 kids. She had chills and exhaustion for about 10 days.My roommate just tested positive last week.
She had flu symptoms. If I was exposed at all, the worse I got was a pretty intense, prolonged headache... fatigue as well but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs just from being stuck inside all day.

Test results still pending.air canada gave me rona. i was sick a week. mainly exhaustion...felt like flu. small cough.

Price of stonks goes up.Print more dollars to have more dollars available means dollars are worth lessIncreased liquidity is caused by a flood of credit in the market due to low interest rates.

Though this credit has to be paid back, understand that credit is essentially a ‚Äúbuy now, pay later‚Äù deal. Excess credit (and the entire leveraging process of an economy) therefore inflates the price of assets now, but all but guarantees deflation of assets during a deleveraging phase. 

This is why there is always an almost euphoric period of brrrr for 20-30 years and then 20-30 years of mild to extreme economic depression. It‚Äôs a cycle of leveraging and deleveraging; the issuing of credit and the paying of it back.You need to spend money to make money, and if your money is tied up paying off your capital, you can‚Äôt invest in more capital in order to be more productiveNot necessarily.. because companies wont need to pay back the debt because they can keep rolling it forever.. just taking larger and larger loans often even adding the interest that was due into the new loan (PIK) that they roll it intoHave you ever gotten a DUI and your license suspended for a year?

What exactly?Which newsthis post sounds eerily like the topi was once a gay bear. during the first crash i bought spy 130, 170,180p for sept and december which im still holding .those are currently down 60kYou bought puts at the bottom, we are buying puts at near ATH. There is quite a difference here.I don't have \*LEAP\* puts, but I get a monthly SPY put or VXX call near EOD whenever we have huge EOD pumps, bc I know that there's gotta be at least one red day between now and their expiry. Then on each red day I pick up a weekly SPY call for the rebound. I'm still a bear ‚Äî¬†I know the party's gonna end soon ‚Äî¬†but while the music's going you might as well dance.Guhna*This is why your core positions should be 3+ month expiry with half your portfolio cash to DCAThe thing is, there‚Äôs so much cash on the sidelines rn that the second the market ‚Äúdrops‚Äù substantially, so many people are buying back inI may have to inverse your recommendation for an inverse

You are 22 and you really want to simp tf already? Snap out of it. You can't find love because you haven't even found yourself. Step tf up and do YOU for a few years.

Edit* had to reread.  *your* mom.  SryPlease take care of yourself, little brotherI lost money on fv calls after ot dropped after reaching 268. Then I bought puts on tesla..a bit late but it was a good trade. Then I fucked up with puts on gold when it rose again. Fuck meHell yeah man, drinking covers all lossesSame guy probably will post another DD this weekendHeres your DD.  $24 is an incredible price for this stock.  When WSB / robinhood traders got involved it shot up around 10%.  It corrected back to a healthy $24 range and broke resistance 4-5 times in the last 3 days.  Main reason it stopped its steady increase, other than a natural market wide correction was because of the radical volume / options activity and shilling from new investors.  Majority holders / whales did what they should have done - sold at the top.  This naturally caused a lot of people to lose money on their options that they bought when it peaked around 26-27.  The reaction to this has given PRPL a bad rep in the WSB Universe, but it is still a legitimately strong company with nothing but growth coming.  The company is sitting on millions in cash and will undoubtedly smash earnings.  Purple is growing to become the largest Mattress company in America which is no small feat.  Tempur Pedic is losing money while Purple is dealing with a flux of new customers daily.  They just built a new factory.  They have maintained marketing at a steady rate because they can‚Äôt handle too many new customers yet, hence the new factory.  They are scaling up while competition scales down.  What happens next?  The competition ceases to exist and the growing company gobbles up the market.  Casper, serta, sealy, simmons, tempur pedic - most relied on show rooms and mattress firm for sales.  Purple has always built their business on referrals and deliveries.  The economic climate is perfect for their business model and their product is top notch - go read reviews.

PRPL has stayed above $23 in the past week of fomo and major sell offs.  Don‚Äôt let the idiots who lost money on poorly timed calls fool you - this shit is going to destroy earnings, pop and rise steadily at least until a market crash happens.  I have $30 calls for 8/21 and am not phased at all.  Businesses in Utah know what they‚Äôre doing.  Look at Overstock.I think they closed PRPL below $24 so they can reset the convenants on the warrants but unsureUs working ppl need help too broJust checked and those are $2.03?!?!? They're struggling but not dead like that.It barely went down despite the data leak news so I guess there's nowhere to go but up....or flatI honestly don‚Äôt see any end to Intel‚Äôs sinking until some positive news comes out for it to rally on.

I.E. Prpl and SLVTTM squeeze indicator, RSI

These are available in ToS Studies

They give you an idea, but nothing will TELL you... Then everyone would make money everytime haha.If you are new to trading, I recommend the Ichimoku cloud indicator.  Although the indicator can appear a bit messy, it is easy to take trades with once you get used to looking At it.  A vwap line is also very useful for intraday stock trading.  You may choose to add an RSI or MFI indicator to help you identify overbought and oversold situations.  I recommend drawing your supports and resistances on multiple timeframes before taking a trade.  You may prefer Fibonacci retracement, or some combo. Most important, protect your capital, your capital is your life line.  Not over risking and remaining disciplined is even more imperative for intraday trading.nooooooYeah, I was mad I sold my calls at first, but now it feels like I did the right thingI sure hope not.

1. Find a millennial stock that you can afford to buy shares to cover, then attempt to sell WAY OTM contracts on earnings day when the IV is fucking crazy.as a naked put seller this shit mad easy:

tldr is to look for stocks that are trending up, sell a put between 5-10% OTM, and just wait until you're satisfied with the premium collected (some people do 50%, some people wait for expiry), and then buy the short put back. unlike long options if you miss the move short puts let you make money off a past move so long as it doesnt reverseYou'll get fucking wiped with one bad trade. Unless you do that cuck shit of selling premium on 10+ tickers diversified on expiry.

All that work to chase 1-2% a week,  you won't make it.Search YouTube for ‚Äúiron condor‚Äù and someone will narrate the process for you with moving picturesSchpaaaaaaaaaaaammm.Use them for a year, make their own devices that do the same thing, then drop em.

Something you will rarely see here. I‚Äôm now planning on riding purple and silver options to tendie town. How did I get here? Rode the reit wave a month or two ago, then got in on purple and silver.

I used to buy silver online in the past. When I went recently and saw there‚Äôs basically 0 silver available online, I knew there was a shortage and that it was going to the moon. 

No YOLO‚Äôs. But I will admit at one point I was like 50% down and very pissed. This was all done trading options. I have a brokerage account where I play nice and follow the rules. My Robinhood account was meant to play options and make tendies from sweet leverage.The D.E.N.N.I.S system works pretty well for me.

The last day for a premarket was Friday. The SEC felt like it was unfair to the average joes.You can trade on ToS.. shares only.

Those execs who front ran it have now cost shareholders hundreds of millions of dollars.

Take a deep breath (assuming you‚Äôre wearing a mask) and enjoy that weekend buddy, Monday‚Äôs a new opportunity to lose money!What would‚Äôve returned that much?I am still seethingly mad at how retarded I was today. Was eyeing up CARVANA since close yesterday, firmly confident. Literally 10 minutes before open I see all the RKT gang boys on here and got caught on their hype. I turned away from massive gains for something that in hindsight wasn‚Äôt going to double my money like CARVANA puts. So yeah I‚Äôm just dumb as fuckNasdaq too overvalued imoNo need for September, probably Next week or Mid August, IPO price was extremly undervalued, surprised it didnt open at $80 like BIGCSeems pretty reasonable.Mnuchin seems like one of those guys who constantly put on chapstickRKT is how the younger people are applying and getting mortgages.

It's nothing newTrue lol but isn‚Äôt tik tok like Vine?It all booked down to how high the stock goes compared to what you paid for it. 

Let's say you spend 100 bucks per contract at a strike price of 200. That stock then gaps up to 210 over the weekend. 

This puts your strike price at 10 dollars lower than the real price of the stock. Because each contract is for 100 shares, that contract is now worth at least 1000 (10 dollars profit per share times 100 shares).

You therefore paid $100 for something that is now worth $1000. That's 900 in pure profit- making it 900% gains. A 9 bagger.they predict stock go upTheta gang.

*Hit ATH by Tuesday close.*I‚Äôm Already down a lot might as well see it through.Ideally before earnings but up from now lolNot a horror story yet, but could be. RXT released this week and outside of jumping up for a bit right after IPO (when I bought, of course) it's been down. 

No idea if the company's good or not, but its tech. Can't be that bad, right?shamed out of townPlaying LOW for earnings. Hoping for a double pop. If HDX reports good earnings the day before they might pop, then LOW reports good earnings the day after and pop again.Nio could be a play. Earnings are TuesdayI am holding TGT and WORK calls for the ER, would probably end up selling before the ER. For OTM (and hopefully ten+ bagger) I am holding UBER Jan 15, 2021 calls.I've been long on SRNE forever, you can read my prior posts for detailed info.

Today I yolo'd some September calls in the low 20s for \~$200 each.  Calls that high just opened up a couple days ago.  With the way this week went, Stock could break into the 20s+ within just the next 2 weeks.CscoExpiry? Far enough out will be fineSPXS play 3x leveraged bro wtf r u doinYou‚Äôre wrong. Your portfolio jiminy cricket tried to save yourself from yourselfI went to high school with Nick Nash, he was the president of the company for a couple years and helped take it public. He was a double major physics and chemistry at MIT. The CEO of the company is even smarter than he is. They are a sleeper. I was really smart and bought near the IPO around 12 and sold at 15 bc I thought - who cares about SE Asia.

writing them is midwest upper middle class house.I don't think so. It's more profitable to write then buy because most options expire worthless.Theta gang is typically very slow and steady gains.

* You learned that deep OTM options are (generally speaking) losers. Have you considered ATM/ITM options?
* You don't want to spend too much of your portfolio on one item. What else is in your portfolio, and how good are those returns?
* Can you use the rest of your portfolio as leverage, such as covered calls or secured puts?
* Have you considered other strategies, like credit spreads?
* You don't need a lot of capital to play options, you just need to use it a little more conservatively than only buying FDs.

You learned something valuable, and it's worth applying. Even if you just paper trade, consider using what you have learned and see if you can do better next time. Not a single person that is successful here did not experience similar discouraging setbacks.Lol wow dude whatever it takes for you to get healthy but I started with $500 and I'm $27k 4months in so you can do anything just don't be a retard pig. - signed a bull created by jpowMonday is bigly green after this dipYeah, but with options it's hella leveraged so you make moreyea it‚Äôs kind of a vicious cycle hahaSame people that bought SPY 270 pits few months backSold off a bunch of my stock and bought SPY puts for next week.

It is traded by machine and algo or by option trading 

Not much physical delivery of stocks during last 5 monthsIt's the same thing with oil, most people trading commodities futures are speculators or people/corporations hedging that never have any intention of taking physical delivery...it's how the system works, and why we saw negative oil prices earlier this year. Nothing new.

Interestingly, what you describe actually played out in the oil futures market in 08.

Not necessarily saying I‚Äôd support it, since there‚Äôs a lot of other things to consider, but you look at how much they made from passive holdings while everybody else is getting fucked and it‚Äôs kinda ridiculous.I mean individuals get taxed at 40% after a certain point. It‚Äôs outrageous. I dare the government to demand 40% from a corporation.Won't someone think about the poor, underappreciated billionaires ?Billionaires get rich as fuck and we just get fukd?

If your employer supports it, you can contribute to Roth 401k regardless of income. 

The contribution limit to a 401k and Roth 401k are a combined amount, so that‚Äôs where you really need to decide what approach you want to take. Most recommend 401k as your tax rate is likely lower in retirement, and you can pass along inheritance tax free up to a large sum. Going Roth 401k you are paying those taxes now, but will not have to pay upon withdrawal.does your employer match post tax also (which is what Roth 401K is)?

It would have to be reallocated from something else. It would also be immediately challenged.He did the first student loan repayment suspension without Congress.Not really but he can do a few things. He can suspend payroll tax, put a moritorium on evictions, and perhaps suspend student loan payments. But he cant distribute dollars to do these things. So all of these payments can be delayed, but will just be owed when the EO order expires. He may be able to use some funds he has access to, but these are limited and no where near the 1, 2, or 3 trillion dollars required. My guess is he tries to push the boundaries of what is legal in the executive orders, forcing someone to be the focus of bad price that challenging these things in the courts would entail.Only Congress can approveYes he can, along with eliminating payroll taxes which equals 3k for 40k annuallyOr amazon.

SPCE calls for the same expiry are also cheap.I still really like MPC for going long. It has a lot of potential to gain especially after they sold speedway for $20 billion. They‚Äôve got plenty of cash to get through this thing and still selling plenty of diesel fuel.

Also bought 265 fb put when fb was 11 points up. Sold at bottom 266.3. Watching that Price for an age as algos fought, it wouldn't let it drop below 266.3 so i sold there. 
I must add these weren't genius plays. I didn't expect either to pay off (i thought cvna would have a pull back, didn't expect it to shit the bed) but for around 20 dollars for the pair, I thought fuck it. I only bought 1 contract each cause i hate burning money. This was just a bit of fun to keep me interested. Made just over 100 dollars for the pair, so nothing too spectacular, but still it kept the day interesting.no, I was chicken.

Any rumors?ORCL dipped back in mid June to 51, and I bought some orcl calls cause that stock trades in a tight range.

Oracle has solid technology, but it's not the cloud tech being adopted by new customers. I work in that field, including consulting on oracle installs.  For me, that's always a long term existing customer.  New installs, and speaking specifically of big data analytics, I hear about Amazon AWS (which can sometimes include oracle, but it usually means redshift), and Microsoft Synapse (Azure).

Or in Nasdaq case, above itTechnically, not really about the market.
Inflation / money printing has devalued the dollar, so people don‚Äôt want to lose money sitting cash gang.

A devalued dollar inflates equalities and commodities.  People anticipate this, and that drives the prices higherCorrection implies recession, which implies inflation of the dollar and overvaluing of $GLD / $SLV. Dollar worth less? Gold Silver worth more.

That being said, it's not 2008/2009 this time. Gold / silver buyers now have 10-15% max left before it Iron Condors and starts divesting Q2/Q3 2021.Priced inthis is like a car accident waiting to happen üëÄCould go down a bunch in the time in between.

BRK.b is trading at a 2 year low despite their largest position rising more than double.  Airline losses already got caught last earnings.  

No reason it should be sub $200.  Buy 200c for next earnings till everyone catches on.  Fuck fundamentals just go with what makes sense and honestly you won't find it here. My brkb DD got me banned and at the time of posting Aug 21 200cs were $2 those are $9 today.

It's not a yolo 10 bagger but it was easy fuckin money

If your doing technicals without an algo you already lost.i just follow what has hype building up but not too much (early hype)

i look at fundamentals and analyst ratings then dive inWhat research? Stonks always go up.Every weekend I have to explain this - research,  aka dd, is priced in.  Do you think your research is going to discover something no one else has? 
2 ways to make money 
1 insider info - sadly it's illegal and even more sadly ishard to come by.
2 your gut feeling.  
Go with your gut, your vibe, your feelings.  Welcome to tendietownThe problem is that you would sell before it became a million dollarsIt is possible but good luck finding the needle in the haystack. You‚Äôre more likely to find a worthless stock than some amazing company[deleted]Yeah, this is a possible thing. But unless you're trading with inside information, it's basically impossible to discover these gems.Possible yes, probable no. You know how in gambling there‚Äôs bets that are like 1 in 100,000 odds. Think about it that way.That what I‚Äôm trying to do with tcip. Brought 15 option for 10 cent on every call date up to November. One of them have to hitHTZ may have the potential for this.  
Everybody renting cars for road trips this summer. 

Earnings may be a good preview at turning things around. 

Word on the street is they are targeting $3.00. 
Gotta start somewhere.its for people who are only down -25% all timeYes, yes, it is dying out. Not enough people and no one contributed.Dick pic to mods first.  It's how you get to post.[deleted]crayon drawings and face paint my friend158.33 is a very interesting price point. Look for a fibonacci retracement this week, or a dick and balls shaped breakout.

Get the fuck out of here with your technical analysis horseshit. If you think you can beat the algorithms that trade on these indicators, you are an idiot.Dip? Toyota has fuel cell cars on the road now (Mirai) and Fuel Cell trucks on trial at the Ports in CA (Project Portal, ZANZEFF)

https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/27882744.htmlStop watching Fox NewsPeople rotated in June after a big tech rally. Didn't have a major impact.

My only regret is I didn‚Äôt wait for further expiries to be written. The furthest is som like 6/22PCG seems to enjoy getting sued. Just learned recently they were the defendant in the Erin Brockovich movieIf silver shows continued strength/support Monday, might sell my other positions and just go with it. Arguably the best trend right nowELY probably.Apple cheated though, choosing to split their stock.Not at all, earnings are still another week out, plenty of timeWhat you mean? - Bought before earnings, told everyone on here they would moon.

Do you listen to what he says?The democrats was willing to meet the republicans in the middle and reduce their stimulus proposal by 1 trillion dollars to an ask of 2 trillion dollars.

What now?GPRO duh.Seems like it‚Äôs always profitable better than gambling on fdsCash is cash homieI'm disturbed you didnt make it an even 100, im terrified of you.125, all Jan 21 and beyond. Miss me with those weeklies. Every idiot who cried about SLV losses today bought weeklies. Every one of my contracts are still in the green.Hey now, GI Joe was asking for it okay? Not my faultLmao you are actually somewhat close. Long story short, puts on my asshole üî•Rona free üôèCrohn's Disease ripping me a new one on my insides üôÉ Or was it that GI JOE figure I shoved up my ass?

But those gains dont mean shit unless you sell at the top. Which is a lesson a lot of people are about to learnWe ain‚Äôt tryna get them sweet 5% 401k gainz sonThat‚Äôs Alabama like vibes broBelterra Casino, in Indiana, is a nice boat. Racers strip club is also right down the interstate, across from Kentucky Speedway. Belterra is where i throw away the money im not throwing away on options.

Honestly just stick to the tickers you see mentioned here often that are big namesi bought them mostly towards end of day with the intention of holding thru the weekend

EDIT why do u think it has a chance of printing and what is ur market bias rn? ur positioning generally are u bullish bearishmost towards end of day so they haven't really budgedSameYeah I lost a ton of money (to me) and fucked my savings up bad. But... WSB helped me get through it and just helped me keep a cool headhaha oh boy i wish. turns out if you're really dumb/a bit unlucky you can lose a lot of money buying shares in shitty companies. I put 20k into TSE:LABS back in September. sold that a couple months ago for 1.80. so that explains almost half of the loses. around the same time I also bought 10k in OGI, sold for a 3k loss or so. 

held NET from IPO until February, when I decided to dump it to play BYND earnings. BYND tanked, NET mooned the next f'n day lol.   So that's when things really stared getting badChilling mayne wbu?That hit close to homeThat's so metaAre you the nerdy guy in *Failure to Launch*?Savage.I think in terms of lossesI will when the second stimulus is hereOnly subs get the premium snapchat.GLD is gudSame. Too close to home!I had to leave 5 min before the end, seemed fine to me.The ultimate YOLOThere are a ton of minimum wage jobs around me in Oregon, but that's still $11/hr with tips to pump gas. Which is more than I got in Florida as a network admin for the sheriff's office, doj, ems and courthouses.

Crazy thing is my rent is the same. Foods about the same cost, energy is half the cost, cars and bikes are 1/5 the cost.

Can't wait to roll all my 60s bikes back to Florida on a trailer and sell out. Like $200 for a 75 goldwing in good running condition (my actual cost was 300 after working on it). Spent $300 on 3 60s Yamaha enduros. Why is minimum so high, it's like life can be fair. People said our economy would collapse but all I see is more poor people eating right with new cars.You ever read about the ‚Äúgreat filter‚Äù? It‚Äôs basically what you‚Äôre talking about. Every potential interplanetary civilization has to pass through some civilization threatening obstacle, and it‚Äôs potentially the answer to the Fermi paradox. 

If, like the drake equation suggests, the galaxy should be full of life, why haven‚Äôt we been contacted by, or found any? The great filter could be why, the galaxy could be littered with the burnt out husks of failed civilizations that died out for whatever reason. 

Personally, I think catastrophic climate change and how we respond to it is our great filter, and barring some civilization saving technical fix, I don‚Äôt think we make it past 2050.

I hope I‚Äôm wrong because I wouldn‚Äôt be that old then and there‚Äôs so much cool shit to see, but yeah that‚Äôs kind of what I‚Äôm waiting for too. 

Are we gonna make it or not?Glad u made it!Did you just get done watching the documentary sent to us from the future called ‚ÄúIdiocracy?‚ÄùI‚Äôm sure there are some benefits then versus now, but the fact you were even able to type that complaint out and have it seen by millions of other people is pretty cool.

Guh!I‚Äôve had a constant escalator up, elevator down. Shares wild success. Options mixed results but some bad losses. Today was one of my best days ever for options and took the elevator up, but I remain steadfastly in the camp that you should have much more of your accounts in shares than options.

Trust SLVYes  surprised at how well Dems have dominated the messaging on this. Normally repubs are so good at that. Really curious as to the motivation here, whether this is coordinated by Republicans to make trump look like a hero with executive orders or whether there is so much dissension in the Republican ranks that they can't whip up the votes for any sort of compromise.Too much bs in the Dems bill. Maybe they look good I haven‚Äôt watched anything they said but in the end, Trump can executive order some good stuff. If they challenge it they look like they are fighting needed help. If they don‚Äôt Trump gets the win. No win situation for the Dems. They should have just extended when they could and fought a different battlenah when gamma drops a lot it usually means people arent buying puts as a hedge anymore cause they dont think it can drop further. in fact, gamma "bottoming" this month at the current level usually means huge gains for spy in the upcoming daysBought at 19.50 originally10/16 30c should be good what do you thinkI'll definitely suck some iDick if that happens.Lmao okay bro.

It just seems like nothing is affecting the market at all. I honestly thought we would crash Friday with the good Job news. I thought good news was bad news but apparently notI'm just doubting myself, was expecting something bigger on Friday. Market just didn't seem to give a dickSomeone is going to make a killing shorting it right on time. Not me, but someoneThanks man, I needed some confirmation that I'm not going crazyIdk man it just slides right out. No wiping required any moreLmao. Reminds me of one of the askreddits where doctors/nurses were asked about the strangest things they had to pull out of people's asses.

There was this old man who needed a carrot removed from his rectum. Apparently removing various types of fruits from people's guts isn't too uncommon in the medical field.

Anyways, dude is obviously embarrassed. So he kept posing this question to the nurse along the lines of "I've recently started drinking only carrot juice, is that why this happened?" 

I guess the nurse just felt bad for the guy, so she didn't really confirm or deny that drinking carrot juice isn't a valid way to sprout a fully grown carrot inside one's colon between then and the last time he had taken a shit.Shit was on point too. Spicy deluxe ftwRiversideAlmost made up for gettIng railed by AAPL and FSLY.[deleted]Do you think it's just lack of education or legit brainwashed by propaganda etc.?I think that feeling is instead the power of man when it works together. Government is the power of millions of people('s tax dollars) that can generate massive collective benefits that can't be done another way.

I don't think it is at all weaklings who can't parent themselves. Give people a bit of credit here, at least follow what the Founders were sayingNo, just stonksNah, tech got fucked yesterday but SPY still didnt drill properlyIt's not just that.

see i thought about that, how can such a loss happen,. everyone keeps saying it, and a dude told me he thinks stock market will lose 80%..and he trades. 80% bro?

I dont think it can happen unless real estate shits like 2008. but it wont, much better safeguards and timeline on that is like a year ahead for it to happen.

all the businesses that are still working all around the world - ok so they lose sales. are they gonna close when they have billions in cash and property? no.

i mean the market can go down, but it wont go down 20% - the world is as it is, the stock market is a GLOBAL thing - and worldwide everything is pretty good. If corona pwned companies didnt drag the market down, we would be fucking FLYING. look at FB GOOG, etc, why would they go down? They are serving half the people in this world by now. I bought an AMD laptop, and i own 3 other laptops from intel.

shits not gonna happen. correction of some sorts, maybe, but nothing insaneAs long as my calls go up I‚Äôm cool hallucinatingBut would we have as much fun and loss porn?

Both had IPO‚Äôs recently and both mooned weeks/months into them. DKNG mooned becuase of sports hype while NKLA mooned becuase of EV hype and a rotation into tech and EV shit.

Better paying mayyyybe, but I'm salaried, average 40 hrs a wk, 6 wks vacation, WFM, make my own schedule, never see my boss, get to travel domestically and internationally but not so much that I'm never home, am usually far from bored, and am in a position that uses my very niche set of not readily transferable skills. To transition I'd probably need to give up a lot of that freedom and I'm not sure what amount of extra money would make that worth it. Double my salary? In this field it's easier to envision making 100k gambling than that kind of windfall.

Good thing is that they repurchased $5 billion in shares.Because despite the record buybacks at great prices and this being the worst quarter ever, they increased cash to almost $150 billion.

learn to speak advanced emojiüëÅüëÖüëÅU can‚Äôt??I called IT and they told me to try turning it off and on again. Maybe it will help.I eventually learned to start using up my 3 strikes and stop holding them. It‚Äôs like video games- I would always hold the good weapons in case a harder boss came along. 

Eventually realized that if I had made great profit in the same day I placed the option, fuckin take the cash bro, to hell with the strike. Even if it‚Äôs my 3rd one, take the gains. 

Worst cases if you end up going over your 3 and get hit with PDT:  
- move to a new broker 
- if with TD, call and say ‚Äúmy bad.‚Äù They‚Äôll remove the PDT at least one time, maybe more

Or:  
- open a Spread to lock in your gains instead (sell calls one strike higher)
- or if you can‚Äôt do that, buy a put on the same security, or one that moves with it (like QQQ if you have calls on AAPL)Pretty sure you have to wait 3-5 days for your money to clear though with a cash accountWhat‚Äôs a cash account? :/ what‚Äôs the difference between what I use now? I do use think or swim w TDInteresting.. I think I need to do some more research on spreads, been hearing a lot about them in this community. Do you use them often?That makes way more sense? I don‚Äôt trade on margin anyways?WrongNoeWrongYeaFor holding for the next decade? Definitely. MSFT is ready for the next decade compared to any of these options. Amazon is tooIts bearish for The Fed balance sheet ROI and the proliferation of the debt fueled equity bubble we current trade in.

Im in dangerDOCU feels the best for some reason.Yup I just said that to someone else, a very resilient stock. Many opportunities to dump but it hasn't really.For me, MSFT is the scary one. AMD is very resilient and has had many chances to dump hard but hasn't. It's definitely being either held or bought, nobody smart really panic sells it.Yeah but you know how retarded the market is. I feel that MSFT trades in a 211-216 range until we see the result of the deal, if any. And I don‚Äôt think that will be for a while.Exactly.   It's a decent nice PAAS provider that makes a little money and has a few customers for their technology, but it nowhere near warrants the 500 trillion dollar valuation, or whatever massively over inflated valuation it is.

Longest I've gone with actual zero sleep was around 52 hours (work-induced).  I used to go a week or more with only 2-4hr naps here and there (also work-induced).

Still think it shoots up until thenDanm only 70 I'm charging $110 here in NCThat's like saying we refuse to allow you lot out of the caves until you cure cancer.

Except everyone LOVES this idea.100% correct. Indoor shared spaces are where you're going to get it, and outside of crazy hot regions the summer is the least indoor time of the year. I'm just fine sitting outside at a restaurant, but I wouldn't sit indoors even if the food was free. RIP service industry north of the Mason-Dixon come fall.For airline stocks I doubt they will shoot up until vaccine but I definitely think that we now know where about their floor is and you never know when a nice vaccine pump will come out shooting up long dated calls.You are fake news. Covid is a lie and people are tired of believing the lie. Good luck.I hope sothey should start blowing neighbors for money. some hotties over there for sureThey were down 72% for the year and were able to hold at a certain level, they broke the downtrend on Thursday with an uptick in volume, and stock was heavily shorted going into earnings. Felt like it was prime for a nice little squeeze and I like to gamble lol.Be careful. These types of stocks love false breakouts, I cashed out my gains but if it does ever run again you are correct, it will run hard.I was trying to get other orders for the same option filled but I couldn‚Äôt get it at the price I wanted to so I cancelled them. Was trying to play with a little more money but didn‚Äôt want to chase so just left my $1500 to ride overnight. $1500 put in -> cashed out $4860.Navi 21 (RDNA 2) is the upcoming AMD GPU gen. Now RDNA 3 and RDNA 4 confirmed. They done check mated both Intel and NVIDIA with one stone. They're not just winning the sprint, they're looking to claim the entire triathlon. 

I'm betting that AMD will also probably make it so that coupling their GPU and CPU appreciably boosts system performance and efficiency, making it cost-ineffective to even consider Intel or NVIDIA over a full AMD build for both retail and wholesale markets. GG no re.I‚Äôve been making someone else very happy, then.That makes feel better that my 5k lost since February is now in a fellow WSBer's RH account ü•∞What goes up, must come down

Edit: before going upper9/18 220c for me.Can confirm. My calls diedIf commercial banks push down yields low enough and people start borrowing again while the stock market is crashing the banks will be making money through loans and through trading. Am I wrong?Maybe. Depends on how the election impacts markets and if Covid produces a significant 2nd wave. Also if economic data continues to reflect recession even in Q3-4, the dreams of a speedy recovery from Covid die.Inflation is literally the foundation of our dollar.  The federal reserve will forever print money and there is no way to reverse the falling value.Thank you kind sir, for your words of comfort and encouragement.

I was only 9 years old in 08 so i had absolutely no awareness of the impact of the financial crisis. All i do know, the amount of "real estate investors" that exploded from that unfortunate situation definitely seems like a degenerate move that paid off extremely well (grant stephan and what not).I bought 20 shares at like 19$. who knows, maybe they'll explode enough to clover my closing costs /sYeah that's what i'm hoping for as well. I'm currently living with a friend with a month to month lease, but with preapproval already done, i'm hoping to hop in a place fairly quickly. no down payment as i'll be using a VA loan, but if i can snag some super low interest rates i'd be a happy camperNo. Lol.

Good for him though!which pricesYeah they love to wallow in misery. Just laugh and move on. Being hopeful is way more healthy.I totally agree, FDs are the best to max gains. I wish I bought silver FDs, my gains is not that much on monthliesOnce I get unrestricted from PDT I‚Äôm doing FDs againThat‚Äôs what I hoped at first, but that couldn‚Äôt explain this exponential increaseDid the same thing with 450'sI lost like 600 bucks. Bought at the top, thought she was going to 280.You have timeI think youre good especially if the stimulus brings nasdaq up. FB really seemed to trend off the Nasdaq the past 2 daysYeah those will print.

3 huge purchase there^^^^^So we‚Äôll have to pay it all back at a later date? If so I‚Äôd rather not have that headache.shit gonna flop just like every other "competitor"You know it‚Äôs bad when even CNBC defends TeslaThey‚Äôre probably scalping though, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs taking forever, if you put in a Limit Order of $3.50 for example, Rh will get it $3.45 on the market but charge you $3.50. Then pocket $0.05 on options so that‚Äôs like $5 per contractNo, that‚Äôs because Robinhood was not down, and allowed you to tradeI mean, it could be flat.Load up on FDs, got itsayter love incoming you stubborn lil fukrüëâüëàThat‚Äôs my lineAverage Mclaren owner will never see the batteryHe doesn't have the power to do that.

I was at a speech he gave at a university in Chengdu some years back and when he gave an example of how he used to stutter in his youth, the students tittered nervously, and he suddenly castigated them for laughing at him.

U got Puts?does that even matter with the accessibility of fractional shares ?Me too. It‚Äôs such an amazing opportunity that apparently no one is talking about and it boggles my mind. 14% downside for you, but at least 100% upside, probable 300-400%. I guess we will keep our secretRumor to to merge with Proterra so they can go public. It‚Äôs an eco friendly bus company. Nikola, fisker, and Hyliion all did the same thing. If the deal doesn‚Äôt go though, or the board doesn‚Äôt vote for extension, then original $10 per share is refunded. If you buy share at $11. You only have 10% risk but huge possible upsideIt seems like it‚Äôs heading down. I think that post actually moved it up lmao. I bought pretty high at 11.60 share (no warrants I‚Äôm a pussy) but I‚Äôm not worried in the slightestNot too bad, it‚Äôs about the size of my priestsExecutive order he announced today.

I'll just inverseI'm always afraid of MMs fake out anti pump dump to get that max pain just right. I called FLIRs dump after good earnings. Bet against the tidePuppies or downies?No, AAPL calls.Appl Puts.  Looks like a switch to financials is occurring. Not saying tech is dead but it used to the Biotech then to Tech and now Financials and Industrial. Keep an eye on the sectors.Nah im a retard here sirSeems LegitBest week I've had in a while with futures. Fucked myself a couple times last night or today would've been so fucking green.Isn‚Äôt every week?I‚Äôm not really sure... we are still scraping ATHs everywhere, so the drops are still smaller than the gains over any time horizon over a week.nope. it‚Äôs actually dangerous to sell options right now if you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing as implied volatility is seemingly lower than actual volatilityYeah 10% for MSFT would take it to like 230+, definitely not that lmao I exaggerated.I feel extra autisticüêçüêç are slimyWas just going off the 2 comments below the one below mine.

Soups in Campbell's.You seen any other ones you'd recommend? I really enjoyed Code 8 as wellThank you I'll check them out.I'm not here to make a case for you. Just looking for an alternative to metals to trade. I am up big ( to me) in SLV right now so looking for something else.Like planting a garden?Can you give me an example?How is it an uh oh, its a great play. Enjoy the discount, enjoy the tendies.You won't regret itiron condors would work?Yeah if it's not long term like 2021 just sell at some top.100$the.. you know, unspoken *coin.*One analyst recently claimed that support for FSLY lies at $75. It's at $77 right now. If it can find another major client to replace TikTok, or if TikTok gets bought or cleared for US usage, wouldn't it mean FSLY should recover some of its losses... we shall seeForm of spending i supposeSamesiesWoke up too early.  Couldn't go back to sleep.

It‚Äôs more started from Tim Cook time that Apple start buybacks to smash earningOh shit he's backUPWK is not a platform for north americans to make good money - unless you have some really specialized niche skill that no one else has. Only ppl from 3rd world countries get hired on UPWK. I should know, I've done a lot of hiring on it. We're told by our managers to not hire anyone from Western countries because they want "fair pay". Why pay an Adobe professional $30/hr when you can pay someone from Singapore $4/hr and he'll work 20 hours a day for you?So, is that like lap-dancing and Air bnb hosting?wasn't AMD's big day. on one of those big red days?  There have been a lot of cases where a company had good earnings and still went up a lot on a red dayI heard Tony Stonk is helping tooAgreeYep, probably won't be just like the 20s, but you can always learn something from historyFeels accurateOnly good think about working Saturday is your rate of return is 100% lmaoAyyyy I love to detail.

In that case I‚Äôll act accordingly on Mondayhow else am i supposed to get 10 baggersit does. it just gets priced into the option before close/ right after openI‚Äôm easily doubling the margin I put down playing theta. I have some spreads that that can hit 3-4x the margin held. I won‚Äôt mess with theta spreads that are less then 2x max profit on the margin. I close early but still, can make decent consistent money to help support the long option plays.That‚Äôs good/r/baddragon

(unless Conngress waives it permanently)Isn't that a WSB documentary?Thanks, I'll check it outBillions isn‚Äôt on Netflix, is it? I really wanna watch it but don‚Äôt wanna play for showtime. I‚Äôll probably just buy a 1 month subscription and binge itI want spy 240 by 8/31. Golden hands!!!Thats the plan. Margarine interest will be a pain thoEven after they stalled it low for June options, I was hoping we would get to 12-13 for July options.  I always figured the hype of this company was worth billions, and now we see the hype-price at about $3.5 billion.  Another 30% jump this week should be well within the cards (and beyond if there's several bits of good news), and a 3x jump to $10 bill should happen on any substantial breakthrough (government / other money, Abivertinib acceleration, etc.).

Thus, if we get to the market cap of Moderna at $30 bill, we're looking at a >$100 stock price.  SRNE will get to a $30 bill market cap by having a couple "billion dollar" products on the market (i.e. Abivertinib for cancer/COVID, covid tests, and any of its other pipeline drugs get approved).  Again, the company has NO DEBT.  With the current stock price, it can dilute 5% and probably fund operations until it's profitable (5% dilution at the current level through the shelf offering would generate approx $170 mill, and the company's cash burn is approx $20-30 mill per month).

When COVI TRACK gets approved within the next couple of weeks, and they're making 5 million per month like they said, they only need to net ~$5 on each to fund all company operations.  Recall, COVI TRACK is the 15 minute antibody blood test.  COVI TRACE is the one that hasn't been filed yet, but that will obviously generate additional revenue.Time to buy more!

Yesterday, I YOLO'd some September calls at 20/21 for ~200 each, which are gonna pay an acceptable 400% if the stock re-doubles on some good news, and could still be a quick 50% if the stock goes up even a few dollars next week.  I learned not to get too greedy with this stock after getting burned on June and July calls, so I didn't buy anything further out beyond 14 for August 14 because I know the MMs are going to try to keep the price around 15 as much as they possibly can.  The short interest rates spike astronomically on this stock in the days leading up to options expiry.  2% of the outstanding company shares are already spoken for in August ITM options.  They don't want to have to turn over another 1% by paying out August 15s. 

Pretty much, every day, just buy the dips.  I expected news Friday, and on no news Friday, that was the cue to buy more.  I expect news Monday morning like they completed their SmartPharm acquisition or that they are starting the Abivertinib phase 2 trial (which can get accelerated in a matter of weeks to get into patients everywhere ASAP if it works like the drug relief therapeutics has).  Then, during the week, I'm hoping for COVI TRACK approval and hopefully their antibody drug IND.But but but whyI‚Äôm scared pls hold me2.5% dip after a 50% run. I guess I'm too greedy and want a better discount.Haven't decided which strike I'll buy yet but waiting for a deeper discount. If it doesn't happen, oh well.This. Gap up then consolidate- repeat.

I'm doing horribly right now but that fatass red candle for 8-8:10 would've caught my attention. After those kinds of run ups, the best thing you can do is have a stop loss.

Constitutional law nerds are gonna jerk off to this era for decades.Guess you never seen Obama or bushAnd it has MY name on it dammit!Why? The duties of what each branch does is defined by the Constitution, and Congress allocates how funds are spent.

I still love you, but it makes me sad to see people burning moneyMeanwhile MarketWatch is telling its readers covid peaked last month and to expect a 30% surge in S&P next week and continued growth for the rest of the year.Yes I think the larger point im making is that we may not necessarily have the means to prevent a deflationary event at a global scale through inflationary practices. Atleast not in the United States.Just be warned that the end result of my thinking is a massive deflationary spiral. You'll need to be prepared to cash out and buy back in on metals if another deflationary crash happens.Yes but my entire argument states that prior history has different circumstances than now. We expect hyperinflation from the 1970s but that might not happen.

And it dipped down to 190 below today. Premium was .15 yesterday and it turned 20 todayAnd still have crusty lips. ü§ÆLol yeah he does. He pastyI am using TD Ameritrade. The last 30mins before market close is so much fun. üòÉPrecedence.. Based on my research, this is basically the same situation in June. Even the pattern matches.. Having said that, there is no 100%, I'm just basing it on precedence, hence 3K is all I'm willing to betHrmmm thanks for the heads up!!Top 3 Scorsese easily and one of my personal favorites, I fucking love Casino. De Niro is better in that than Goodfellas.My pick too but it‚Äôs like a coin tossCould make an argument it's a biotech.. may be useful in treating covid..I was trading emotionally, had a play before them where I didn‚Äôt sell when I had profits and ended up losing. But I doubted old man Warren. I deserve this.It‚Äôs honestly still a good buy. Got some 215c. Waiting for another dip to buy more.It‚Äôs Ight, Buffet should get covid any week now, they‚Äôll tank and we‚Äôll have another opportunity.Agree, agree--- how can 1+1=1.5? I don't know how much synergy they will create, but they shouldn't trip over each other by being connected business entities. I suppose in FSLY's case the question is whether losing TikTok's business deserves a \~32% drop.Without stimulus then businesses will start closing and people will spend less. Less commerce weakens the dollar. Stimulus passing or not would be bad for the dollar, it‚Äôs going to keep going down over the next few months regardless.Nothing to do with BA plane malfunctioning. If anything, bullish, Air India has to buy a new plane.I think its going up majorly by August 21. I'm still holding 300k in the stock. Had a chance to sell it at $177 for a big profit and didn't, so I stood the course today.that .. is a solid plan IMHO

why the fuck shouldn't grown ass adults go to work if they can?They own Instagram and every app wishes it was IG.Ahh appreciate man. Question: so in your example, i see how I got 9x return with a small change in stock price as there is a multiplying factor on underlying stocks. So, At $210, my options contract price doesn‚Äôt have to be up 9x for me to get 9x return on my investment, correct? I think that‚Äôs where i was getting it wrong maybe, thinking the price at which i bought the option (premium) has to be up by same multiple for me to be up by same multiple on my overall investment. Seems like that‚Äôs not the case, correct bro?So say if I bought 15 TDOC $210 oct calls contract at $17.3. And price goes from $193 to say $198 end of next week, that‚Äôs a $5 stock up move = $500 per contract. Investment per contract = 17.3x100= $1730. Profit = 500/1730 = 28.9% even though stock went up 2.6% and we don‚Äôt know how much options price went up by given the Greeks. Correct?No theaters open, missed earnings, poor guidance, etc etcThanksBetter to be early...nows the time thoughFor the gains.Yeah the biggest lender in the country gonna go sub IPOWhat's your reasoning?yea except it doesn‚Äôt happen, timeline is important. it‚Äôs the same thing as saying why sell if stocks will eventually go upDrill team 6?Your portfolio guardian angel saved youDefinitely think it‚Äôs worth buying this dip for the earnings run up.$120KDamnit I hate looking at it lol JUST GO AWAY üòÇTHANK YOU!!! üíØGNUS, been selling deep ITM calls on shit stonk cause it always dies after a pop. jumps in the morning sell calls, watch it die within the week.

I recovered from a 7 grand loss you‚Äôll make it back man.The 8/21 22c I bought them when IV was low and share price was around 17 I think. Sold on the day of earnings. ATVI cemented the don‚Äôt hold earnings rule and play the run up for me lol. Tough luck, plenty of opportunities to be had.You're not alone... but it is fucking freezing in here.Yes, they should have announced on Monday morning though...where do you see October $12 LCA calls at? i only see the months of August, September, November, and February 2021 $12.5 calls10% otm too, how I like it. Nice pick!Prefer OTM but good picks lolNo, McConnell didn't adjourn, so they can get called back to vote. They are mostly all going home tho, similar to last timeIt is mine, I did a screen recording, do you know how to fix ThisI'd buy a 18th Dec $2.50 Call but I'm not sure about it. All that resistanceYea that‚Äôs a good point. I mean I barely know much about the company and I‚Äôm sure they spent years developing their plan. I don‚Äôt see it yet but again I don‚Äôt know much loli was quoting bill ackmans CNBC callWas quoting Mr. Ackman from his epic call in to CNBCi was quoting the Bill Ackman call on CNBCThat‚Äôs fair, I didn‚Äôt want to take profits yesterday because my cash account wouldn‚Äôt settle in time to get back in today if it moonedFBanks are kinda fucked with interest rates at 0..  I dont see that changing any time soon.That's probably it...  Warren B likes preditory companies.Agreed I've used almost all of em over the years. BA by far the #1 shit show.  ML sucks too.  

Me: I want to short after hours

ML: We don't allow that

Me: Why the fuck not?

ML: Because we don't know if we have the shares to borrow.

Me: So you're one of the biggest MM's on the street and you know how many shares are available at 3:59 but not 4:10?

ML: Right

Stonks only go up4 million is the worst. It‚Äôs like your the poorest rich person. Not enough money to completely fuck off and retire but not worth it work. 4 million is purgatory.Back in July, there was a report of unusual options activity (strike $180) expiring then. The timeline would make sense bcz the expectation is for a 737 re certification by October, and there is expected to be a final test flight by the FAA DIRECTOR which will likely send the stock skyrocketing.

 

* At 10:22 a.m., a trader bought 1,000 Boeing call options with a $180 strike price expiring on Aug. 21 at the ask price of $14. The trade represented a $1.4 million bullish bet.
* At 10:25 a.m., a trader bought another 988 Boeing call options with a $180 strike price expiring on Aug. 21 at the ask price of $13.801. The trade represented a $1.36 million bullish bet.
* At 10:41 a.m., a trader sold 600 Boeing put options with a $160 strike price expiring on Nov. 20 at the bid price of $16.851. The trade represented a $1.01 million bullish bet.
* At 12:25 p.m, a trader bought 974 Boeing call options with a $180 strike price expiring on Aug. 21 near the ask price at $14.20.

I only have like 1500 dollarsYou think it'll go to 80?I'm new to this sub. Does it often get as hyped for IPOs as it did with RKT?Jan 2021 but strike don't want to say... i think i bought super high strike because the IV was so much higher at the time.. right after that massive insane pump every stock had for a week there..Lol that 1 year chart is SADAgain, I hope so.This reassured me for my 140/150cs too.Easy 200 after ER8/14 üòêHolding over the weekend.

I just am not sure which one to pick.I was thinking this, I have shares in AAL already. Should have went in at 11, but I see some cheap prices for Jan calls. All it will take is another airline pump and I'd be goldenNot sure since it's a low volume OTC stock. If it can hold above 58 cents for a week or so, possible run to .75 then near 1.00 is certainly possible.200 would've been an entry so kinda missed it already. If it goes back down, 194.50ish then around 180.Thought this stock was related to covid.. a used car company, wtf?

Anyway, around 176.50 if 190 breaks then sell when it gets back near 190.Around 94.You actually trade this?

Anyway, around 49.50 is relative safe.

Biggest liquidity and collateral bottleneck of the year for businesses, money markets and repo happens near the end of Q3. Remember October last year? How about 2018? Now picture that in the current climate. There is a lot of turbulence coming over the next 2-3 months.August brings the winds of change entering into the burrr/ cold months.Lol khis boyfriends lap on your assEarnings report before openDepends on how you feel on NIO really. They did push this earnings forward was originally meant to be september so they might be confident in what they are showing. Alongside great monthy reports (July would have outsold June if not for being closed 5 days due to flooding) and with a record high number of orders.

ckIf you own tech stocks I‚Äôd dump them at these levels, we may not see these prices for a bit, techs rallied on a broad basis during the rally which is pretty much done for now, this is already apparentIt‚Äôs not based on one literal source but the collection of thoughts/opinions/analysis from the biggest and best advisors and money managers in the USIt‚Äôs pretty much been all tech and e-commerceJust curious if it's really "panic proof", just want to compare the prices of before the panic to now.Idk maybe I would have to educate myself a great deal but a lot of my friends actually are more knowledgeable and enjoy forex more than equitiesthats why it is played with insane leverage. so it makes a 0.001c move more funYa you can leverage yourself 100-1000x over you can literally put in 5k if you wanted and have 100k of buying power which makes it A LOT more interesting ha ha ha haWho goes up most on dips rn?Snap brother,  I love the idea of Japanese culture as its portrayed in the West.

The accounting classes were prob the only reason i got a job (customer service , billing, dealing) that paid 19/hr that was soul crushing on some days and a breeze on days my managers werent there. I left hoping to find another job and maybe travel a but but then Coronvirus hit LMAO.
hoping to get another administrative job that pays like 20/hr+ but all the jobs are hard to come by at the money. Been just thinking long term as long as i save properly and keep improving my skill set try to find a role that i like mostly and can support me decently. Fuck employers that lowball employees .

Dems will end shooting themselves as many ppl need the extra UI. Republicans will not challenge.And August is a delivery month for gold you dumb sluts. Aug 26 is when futures trading stops, delivery required by Aug 31.Well what im concerned with is the fact that people are trading electronic contracts and not physical gold. Firstly, this makes it much more liquid which shouldn't be possible given the nature of gold.... what gives gold its value is that people want to hold onto it and they cant just go on a computer and press sell/buy. It adds a lot more volatility to the mix and potential for "fake" value. I am worried that contract owners (or most of them) are just speculators so they won't request delivery or else they would have already / just purchased physical instead. What if they just extend the contracts into further month in order to allow for more speculation and then sell the contracts (without ever taking delivery) once they are satisfied with their short term gains? What do you think?LolLmao üòÇ true, had no idea Kawhi wasn‚Äôt playing lmao.

I've only seen it in history books but the past 20 yrs haven't noticed much. Am I too young? 26 yoWow spoiler alert!SalivatesBad news makes the market go up. More Covid deaths, no stimulus, China tension, dollar collapsing, all of these make the market go up. 

So if anything, buying calls is betting against America and the world.Remember when the market dropped in 2008? Largest drop in history happened due to TARP bailout failing to pass. The market isn't rigged, just based purely on the combination of FED monetary policy and gov fiscal policy. One of those is no longer guaranteed.

Not saying to short the market but it wouldn't surprise me for history to repeat itself.Look at what that Senior cloud engineer tweeted. "This literally happened today. :)" Obviously the deal has been made. If you didn't buy MSFT calls before close today you are missing out for the gap up on MondayYeah and do you know where he will get that money from and what will happen when he tries?Nothing is my pp is a ddshe‚Äôs one of the FDs you can bet on

What is wrong with you?Slightly OTM weeklies on cheap stocks. Slow and steady. After 10k ish I would switch to more long dated optionsThere are many people here that share the same sentiment as you have about our losses and yours is just as valid. You can't really expect a lotto ticket to print in the near term due to most bluechips just declared earnings. If you haven't played spreads yet then give those a shot.Learning different ways to play options is going to help you more from this point forward. Don't hurt yourself man. There will always be the next earnings season to look forward to and lotto tickets will print big again. In the mean time learn what you can and apply that to grow your position. the next earnings season is less than 90 days out.Both tbhWell learned a valuable lesson today.

There was a few consecutive positive days for them and people should have realized that some shit would have happened. There are too many times where I sold for a decent profit(sometimes even 300%) and then the stock continues to move up. I just let it go and look for the next move.

So either we have a very dumb admin (facts kinda suggest yes but still so hard to consider due to the great history of the office) or we are missing some accounting that says we can survive on just 1 trillion. With JPOW consistently suggesting out loud that Congress needs to act, I have to side more with with the Dems if I am being as objective as possibleNot terrible, but since SLV is already so cheap why not go ITM? Its not like SLV is gonna go much further down, the only big risk is it not going up quickly enoughI got UAL Puts. Good luck. You winI‚Äôm sure they could fix it with a zoom session or something, idk just think they gonna try and pull a rabbit out of the hat on this one. 

Could be totally off base though, just seems like if he was just gonna pump, he‚Äôd do it SundayI agree. I don‚Äôt like it, but I think he can do it without congressional approval.Yes the fed is independent. But if JPow wants to go with donnies plan, he can. And congress can‚Äôt stop him.It‚Äôs absurd, but its true. 

The only way to stop it would be a law. But congress doesn‚Äôt seem able to pass laws right now.They are.Only congress can approve spending of tax dollars. Yes.

Best of luck to anyone that has to live in the IE.I mean it‚Äôs literally in the name of the subMaybe its an unpopular opinion but I think in the US the problem is everyone has been TOO brainwashed to think any and all government is shit. So when they do the stupid shit they always do they go, "we told you we were shit. its just our nature" and every once in a while they shit on the floor instead of right on your bed and everyone applauds them for it.Not a lack of education, it is the education.Definitely plausible. There's a lot to be said about a group of people collectively accomplishing something that would otherwise be impossible by the individual.

I don't think everyone feels the way I described, I'm definitely not one of them, but I do think I'm part of a shrinking minority. Looking at people around my age group (29) and younger, a lot of them don't seem to want to take on the risks and responsibility of taking said risk. They seem to believe the risk should be covered financially by someone else.ahh yes. how could i have forgetten this.people are still on that?? lmaooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooI've been playing it and talking about it but the message hasn't been very rosy, especially after earnings and their lack of transition to agency-backed .

I wasn't pissed. Thought you were making a bet.Oh yeah, inverse for puts.Can you rephrase that?

Given how disasterously bad he is in interviews I think there best bet would have been someone kind of genericly bland and charming.

They also bought ATI quite a long time ago, shouldn't the synergies have been effective already? Just wondering before I might buy.You're just passing it on.Why would they make money on loans?  The rates provide shit and the risks are too high to issue them.I've read some rather compelling arguments that the kind of out of control and dangerous inflation that people traditionally fear isn't a risk for us. 

Due to wealth inequality preventing the buying power of the lower and middle classes from increasing, the cost of the staples can't grow proportional to money injected into the market. Further, the dollar's status as the petrodollar prevents truly dangerous inflation. 

At least that's the argument I've read. I don't have the expertise to evaluate it fully, but it seems to check out based on the behavior we're seeing.Tons of airlines and other compares were getting in trouble for the same thing, but they aren‚Äôt sitting on 100B+ of cashTrueMoney is probably best for specific focus on stocksIf silver allows me to quit my job to trade full time, would 100% not be opposed to a little silver surfng fuckboy lol.

Life‚Äôs never the same once you get your first same day 4 baggerTake a break and dump your money into shares for a little bit. It lets you clear your head and come down off of the high/low rollercoaster. You'll still get to watch charts all day, but you'll find it significantly less exciting watching your shares go up 3%. Get back into options when your head feels clear, you're back on pace, and you're not scrambling to try to make up for what you've lostI gotta say I'm more pissed at the Republicans. 1 Trillion vs 2 Trillion?

Plus, there isn't a whole lot of fear in the market right now. There is a shit ton of greed, but unlike 2008 financial crisis, people aren't scared of losing their homes, jobs, income, or putting food on the table

Why? Because they got spoiled with $2400/month +$3400/family to stay at home for 4 months. Shit is about to get real!

A lot of service jobs are gone and won't be coming back. A lot of companies are going BK and furloughing. 

The second stimulus is already late ... the more they squabble, the worse it will get. THEN! WHEN THERE IS ENOUGH FEAR that is when the shit drops like a rock and people look back and think "fuck, I could have lived off that money for 6 months, but I got greedy trying to play FDs"May best man win!I love this place man, I can lose money on stonks with friends and just say all the stupid shit that pops into my head that I can‚Äôt say at work, it‚Äôs a win win.

The quicker it goes up almost non stop, the harder it will drop. I expect a good pull back with gold as well. That or they go sideways for a while before continuing up. As long as you have time on those options, you should be fine.

Dispute over whether it was tech or not led to the change in the IPO. Worked out great for us. 

Hopefully some more people from here will get in. Insiders are buying up stock and I expect institutions are going to start going at it harder but people should have a last chance on Monday.NiceyessirThey are consistently wrong with their earnings dates. Always Google. Same thing with options prices - use ToS or another broker to verify / compare the pricing. RH has super wide bid / asks and slow fills - ever since I started comparing before buying, I get wayyy better fills, below what they are displaying as the mark price.I think you‚Äôll be fine, I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôll pump on an earnings date and options coming out, and just Pump in general because the pump was held back today sortaI made $6 on a UVXY call at openim in the bikini screaming at my screenI honestly thought 280 was happening too. I had 275C and was ITM before peak. Kept going up to 278 and bam, lost all gains. FmlI read it. I just don't seem to get Jeff's solution though?smh it's not that simple and I don't have a positive view of J Pow, but this guy does not have very much insight into the national economic landscape and is not offering any sort of tradeable advice, but keep buying his snake oil...lmk how that works out for you. A second year economics student could have written this steaming pile of shit, and probably would have used better grammar.üíé ‚úã or avg down if you believe in it. I had 85C 9/18 sold yesterday from the rumor.Why??? I see no newsBest of luck, I was looking to pick up some DDOG & FSLY.  If DDOG hits my ridiculous by price of $52.93, I'll load up on it for a quick turnaround.  And I'll also look into dipping into FSLY if it hits $74.99.  News of stimulus could give these tech stocks a quick jolt and make an easy 20%, lol.I need to stop sharing ideas that came from the twisted part of my brain.Gang anthem as far as he‚Äôs concerned.*weekly FDs.Nah. I see it quite a bit with different stocks AH. Good luck next week. I bought a few calls eod to help.Less money printing is bullish for a precious metal? You‚Äôre fucking retarded üòÇsmh, you should be able to get rid of it for a profit with covered calls easily, NVDA premiums are stupid highyeah :( need to cut losers quicker and take profits :SOver 100k easyTyI get that they were bought and sold, I just thought it was a lower number and therefore even more ridiculous. I'm a little spaced after today.Man fuck that, he can't stop baba without butt raping Apple so we'll see what happensWhat happens when it splits in 2 weeks? Or do you use a real broker?Seriously, this motherfucker is the brains of Trump's operation.Ah fuck knew it was some big band dead dude my bad

As apology, I hope you join me and Trump and ‚Äúcome fly with me‚Äù on rocket Monday. That ones Sinatra sure!False. They had an expiry next month. He just extended it indefinitely.So does this mean uppies right?makes senseLolWong retadWhy u so dumbhe can defer, and hopefully it'll be forgiven when/if the congress passes a bill (and there will be pressure to do so obviously), at least this is their strategy from what I understand.Position?Cool I‚Äôll get mo on MondayStrike and date bro?

Long story was about 5 years agosame, but I know for a fact it means I'm a very vulnerable boi.Raw data on BloombergIt‚Äôs possible that it won‚Äôt. But I‚Äôm thinking like my own retarded self. I want a whole ass share not some fraction, want to feel like a baller. 

I think a lot will feel that way too, and buy when it‚Äôs cheaper. It a psychological thingplease stop getting my hopes up. i have suffered far too much LOLFigures, there's a story out in the last couple hours I missed... They're looking at canoo now. I wonder how that will affect the price Monday morning.How are you currently trading?ATVI and CVS YOLOs. Cost me everything.

Maybe it won‚Äôt look but I don‚Äôt see Apple falling 5-10% without taking the entire market with it[deleted]Spiders are spinelessi thought the old guard was worth watching. and i dont know all the hate for the space force series, but i thought it was decent. 
John henry may have been worst movie ive seen, so just for that novelty might be worth a watch.Alright fine. You convince me. I‚Äôll go buy slv. You got meTotally. I think it's directionally going up though, and I'm really not worried about risk to the downside. I guess you could sell a 3 wing instead of 4 wing iron condor, not sure if that has a name.yea lets see how monday goes.Yeah I'm just waiting for a pump to get outI don‚Äôt understandWell... yes - the issue is that I woule have to get out of other positions to sell a put for fsly (I wouldn't want to be assigned tbh - not a good usage of capital)Stonks go up, stonks go down, can‚Äôt explain that. 

Think of stonks like primitive humanity‚Äôs understanding of nature. We didn‚Äôt know why storms happened so we blamed that shit on Poseidon, or why the Nile flooded and caused crops to grow so we prayed to Ra, or Osiris or some other animal headed dude. 

Some people thought they understood why things happened, and sought the council of the stars, or animal entrails, or drugged out oracles. 

This is the TA fags you always see talking about fettuccine retracements and double bottoms and coffee cup handles. 

Humans crave certainty and seek rational explanations for why things happen, but the truth is, stonks go up, and they go down. 

You may lose money today, but as long as you‚Äôre careful and don‚Äôt chase losses or deposit more than you can afford, you‚Äôll eventually make money.

Listen to it loud.SHE‚ÄôS GOT A GREAT ASSI don‚Äôt know that club scene was too hectic lolThe kind of young people that care about the virus aren't the kind that go to Vegas. Besides, shifting to the mail in ballots for every resident draws enough political scrutiny. If they shut it down again people might get pissed off. 

But I'm of the belief that no one is ever going to talk about Covid again after November 4th.Haha true.  That fukOh my godIt's not a popularity contest per se, but it's simple market dynamics, AKA supply and demand.  If there's limited supply and/or greater deman, people will pay more for it.Slow but teachable. You might lastYeah pretty much. Buyers vs sellers.Yes, there's an economic theory about it called a Keynesian beauty contest.I mean, ideally people prefer to buy good companies based on solid fundamentals. This isn't necessarily always the case though, due to things like psychology and whatever, and this is a time period where fundamentals seem to matter less, but things like hertz, or people mixing ZM with ZOOM, or conflating spce with SpaceX, are still outliers and absurd examples of the system not working. We may be near ath but it's on the backs of tech, who correctly or incorrectly, the market has decided is Corona proof and can be successful in a lockdown environment. But look at other sectors, travel, energy, entertainment, retail, food, whatever, other than some outliers the market has priced them all very lowly compared to 6 months ago, which seems a fair valuation.Who is lending to these people?Better than paying 5k a month to put up with homeless and congestion, just because it makes you feel like you're better than other people.¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø  I've traveled a lot already, it's calm and cheap to raise a family here, there's enough decent food around, people are nice, I love the MidwestIf they don't realize that AH Friday is pointless anyway, there's no saving themWhat no?

Does Apple control the entire market? 

I think Apple is overvalued but they're a great company with tons of cash. People like the stock. It won't fall very much before people scoop it up again.What's preventing people from buying puts in case AAPL crashes?Especially after Kanye... that‚Äôs Kanye mf West no homowhat, after Ray-J is ok somehow?Behold the Midwest in all its glory.

If you're cool with being ta1ken for a ride I'd take 3 (540-300) of them and see how it goes. You'll be in for a decent trip no matter what but this will let you gauge the intensity pretty accurately. You could also do this with 1-2 but trying to guess at the intensity of more might be harder.
If those really are 180 tabs then 3 should be enough to let you peek behind the curtain.
As always, stay safe and whatnot!Well there is no way I'm ever doing it again.  Those days are long in my past.

Especially those focusing on last mile delivery.I'm not sure about Kohl's. I don't think I'll be making an earnings play on Kohl'sWell then I sold too early :(I wouldn‚Äôt buy puts. With the government turning them into zombies, they can drag it out for a long time, especially with interest at 0. Crazy shit can happen too. What if Amazon buys Macy‚Äôs? They wouldn‚Äôt care about the inventory, but the real estate they own is worth quite a bit. I‚Äôd avoid puts like the plague.Buying puts on anything right now is pretty risky, no matter how bad anything these days it always seems to at least come back to flat, and in the cases of these stores a lot of them are more likely to declare bankruptcy than tankhttps://outline.com/cskFDz

Throw on your best middle aged pissed off face and fucking explain why you'll be leaving negative reviews, purposely taking forever to pay anything owed, and that you're more than willing to find a different doc.

Nobody knows, we‚Äôre dealing with an experiment that has never been done before. There are socialism levels of federal capital flowing into the economy. And a decade of economic expansion that has been wiped out, though the world depends on it.dark mode??  Should help your tired old eyesI assume that's Russell or small caps index for futures. Can't wait for that sector rotation into travel and other beat up stocks. I wanna see cruise lines shoot up retarded, I wanna see BA go to 200!Yeah I actually got 2 and traded 1 for the magazine because I'm an idiot haha.

Wish me luck.nah i dont want to buy a mortgage company in a recession. all IPOs and SPACs eat shit eventually in this marketDo youThat could happen but I doubt it. Many investors can‚Äôt afford aapl at 450 a share but they‚Äôd love it at 150, or whatever it eventually splits at. 

Plus aapl is gonna be around forever and is viewed as a very safe stock. Bond yields are garbage so where will people park their money?

Precisely what I meant by being YOU. A gf is never going to fix that and you will feel like a bigger failure when it ends. That's why I hunt and fur trap.Talking to women is super easy.  Changing your perspective on what you think you can do or not do is super difficult.Never hurts to have a gf. The right one is the best feeling, just don‚Äôt let her slip awayI‚Äôd gold this if I had made any money this week ü§£COME ON MAN, YOU'RE THE GUY. SAY ITThis is the wayA man of refined tasteI had mp 52s. My getting some Asian brand i think like mkx. They are 50% off fir militarygrossNopeIt sounds cliche but our founding fathers warned of this, you can give centralized power with all of the best intentions but eventually it leads to this. History has shown this time and time again and now here we are.If that wasn‚Äôt a coup, then what you‚Äôre talking about isn‚Äôt a coup.  If people like you had listened to people like me twenty years ago then we would not be in this mess now.ThisYeah, I like hops, but the unfiltered sediment in the delicious Hazy IPA, combined with my poor diet, makes for one messy toilet.Literally the only things taking shits today were tech, precious metals, and oil. You need to diversify my brother. Both DJI and $SPY finished up but you still saying everything took a shit. Branch out in your picks brother. I care about you!he should give us the money he stole from the pentagon to build the wallJPOW has printer.  BRRRR.I‚Äôm pretty excited for mon tho tbhhaha probablyHere's what you need to plan on though, what to do when your strike gets breached. You own $ABC and it's trading at 10. You sell the 11 calls for next week. It shoots to 12, so you wish you'd not sold the calls.

My recommendation is to be ready to roll up and out a few weeks to keep it going as long as you can at least break even (and maybe collect more profit). You can trade time value for intrinsic value so when it eventually pulls back, you rake in all those gains on the downswing.He chose deep ITM Calls.I‚Äôm in 8/28 260s

Yup we can always hope, this market is stupid so anything can happen. And thanks, same to you man!Look I mostly agree with you here but I just put zero value into anything trump says actually happeningMy brother, of course I care.  

That honestly made my day to hear that you are trying for a week. 

I'm so proud of you!Yeah for dollars being devalued daily.Get a job u bum. Walmart always hiring.....go work üôÉnah, im an awd fag but drifting coolopen a credit spread 9/18 short leg 30c thenWhere the fuck is it? I only see casino, sports and poker.Never mind.

So proud 

I would open to here her sex noises as she moans during sexLmao what a toolKudos bro, I couldn‚Äôt handle the pre BB grind. I played hella after BB though. Early BB was the shit tbh.The future's looking bright, 'tis but a scratchMaybe I will on Monday! AYX and MSFT had a heck of a day today.He dedAhhh I see.I‚Äôm so right wing the line gets blurred> compounding interest motherfucker.

They're 0% interest while under suspended payments retard. I will gladly enjoy increased returns by investing those payments in stocks and repaying after the payments are requested.

Salty?Also if Biden wins he says he will pass $10,000 forgiveness with Congress. I owe exactly $10,000. So double win for me hahahaExcept there is no interest and the loans will probably forgiven eventually motherfuckerInterest is deferred as wellIt‚Äôs just meh.    Totally agree that Big Short and Too Big to fail are much better.SkypeOh shit sorry I meant,Jed, Jed Mosleywhat is your favorite album ?No I like themI WANNA KNOW!!!ahh yes. i do like this song. ok. you winNo joke. I'm a Sacramento native so when I heard the song Lodi I just assumed there was a town in the south called Lodi they were singing about. Nope. The little town of Lodi about an hour away from me. I can see why they wouldn't want to be stuck in Lodi again lolYou can‚Äôt beat ithow big of an account are u trading with?

ill be honest too, if 20k is a life changing amount to you then u shouldnt buy a tsla? even a model 3 will be questionable if 20k is "a lot"

or trade options.Only momentarily, and not anymoreThats what i was thinking. Try to catch a minor correction, can't hold more than a couple days those are way out of the moneyIt‚Äôs not just the volume, I think you have to really actively be following the momentum. But yes, I‚Äôve heard the same concerns about the open orders, and I don‚Äôt put a ton of importance on the massive orders that don‚Äôt appear likely to imminently be filled.

It‚Äôs funny to hear 55.00 be a discount for an option contract! Lmao...but with amazon, I hear you. Hopefully some good stimulus talks over weekend if not a deal, deal would be ideal.

+9% day for me which is actually a really great day for me. I am more conservative than most people on this sub. Lot of shares, less options, and almost always within the band of -10 to +10...been more and more on the positive side as I get better and better at this / research more / learn more.

It‚Äôs absolutely insane to me when I see people with -77% in a day or something. Couldn‚Äôt imagine taking those kind of yolos. But that‚Äôs part of the magic of WSB, I can appreciate that from afar.

I want to start selling covered calls to be on the other side of theta. Have a bunch of shares of rocket and will likely do exactly this when options are available, sell far OTM calls and collect the premiums as passive income.Dam I do the same haha! Although it hasn‚Äôt been the hottest week or two for either of those and they‚Äôre so damn risky. You might wanna look into FB and AAPL they‚Äôve been my most successful these past few weeks.If you search those, there's a plethora of YouTube dudes talking about how to interpret them.Just get super drunk and see what happenslol, alright, enjoy feeling like shit, diamond hands that shit to zero next time and be happy.Yahoo! finance department also passed up a chance to sell Yahoo! to MSFT for $33 billion.  It's now worth fuck-allFor real. I fully understand iv crush now and how it works. But also learned a lot for my 2nd time buying calls. Overall the experience was worth it despite losing my house money.Btw, do it man. I just bought AAPL for the very first time today at 3:58. Feels good man I love that company and now I own a little sliver of it.I started with 5k and now I‚Äôm sitting on 35 so 

You‚Äôre wrong.It hasn't happened yet because we have never had a president who has been pushed this hard so close to an election. 

It's a loophole, it's bullshit, it shouldn't be allowed, but the executive branch can print money. We have only printed money two times, 2008 and 2020. 

Trump wants to be seen as the solution to the problem, so he let Congress squabble, discrediting other Republicans, letting Democrats look bad, and making him look like a savior. It's genius.No accepted bids since last Thursday, earnings were responsible for the huge pump at the end of last week, and the earnings this week haven‚Äôt been too influential (and none have the market cap to be substantial enough regardless, since they‚Äôve not got nearly enough weighting to affect SPX, NX , etc like FAANG does). Honestly I think official stimulus release would lead to a sell the news event. You could probably argue it‚Äôs not been ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù recently as much as it has just been the assumption of this entire bull market since March. Look at volume the past few weeks. It‚Äôs super low. There needs to be a big drop, and selling the news on the stimulus could be a catalyst for that. For example, look at DIX/GEX today ‚Äî big drop at the end of a steady rise for them all week just as SPX closes in on ATH and stimulus is close to being passed.Got some 220 for October and 250 for jan

I was not expecting it to tank like it did today fkn hurtsTry the 90 day reboot broCircle o strife amirightEasy, Have other people's moneyYou want hedge funds.Just walk in with a firm handshake your resume and see if they're hiring. I forget what it's called, but there is some kind of trading tracker out there you can use to track your personal performance and the  petition a prop trading firm for a job.Each contract is worth 100 shares.

If you can't afford to cover it then you're fucked if you're assigned.

The upcoming apple split is good if you can afford to buy 250 apple shares right now because when they do split you'll have enough shares to sell 10 covered contracts.

You would be rolling in decent amount of money if you could sell 100 covered contracts.yes... just like you can buy an option and then sell it again? you can sell it and then buy it again. check my other commentthink of it as a 4 way trade  
buyer1 opens a contract with seller1  
buyer2 opens a contract with seller2  
  
2 days later, buyer2 and seller1 both want out of the contract  
buy2 and seller1 close their contracts with each other, and now the remaining contract is between seller2 and buyer1No idea, seems brutal.Ok fine, I'm in.Nah, I just have a bunch of tsla stonksI‚Äôm more a mantis toboggan guy myself.  Always carry monster condoms so the girls think i have a magnum dong.I sold a couple of puts before the shit really hit the fan on the dilution / exec options. But yes I took a risk and it looks like I'll be a poorer man come Monday üòÖYou're still looking at 100,000 years or so

The most we can "realistically" do is colonize MarsThanks, that seems fairOn god. If only there were pics of that ass in those striped pantsI knew it!So basically europoorsYeah so many times subs on the r/all places have had the most contentious posts about NZ and their ‚Äúlife with zero Coronavirus.‚Äù Congratulations for doing the most effective thing to shut down the virus that 99% of the rest of the world doesn‚Äôt have the ability to do, outside other island countries.They'll wake up one day and think to themself *"Was it worth it? Was it worth the ability to be smug at the rest of the world, even if just for a little while?"*

*"Yes, Yes it was"*People will move on somehow. 

Maybe we will lie to ourselves that the shutdowns did something useful, so that people dont believe we suffered pointlessly. People can handle suffering if there is a reason, but not pointless suffering from shutdowns that dont stop spread or aren't required to prevent hospital overwhelming.

Maybe society will collectively say fuck it - its better to prevent a 20 year old from suiciding from no job/future than saving a 90 year old nursing home patient.

I dunno.I think it's the deaths not the cases that makes this worth it sorry mateThe same intelligence report says that China is actively trying to get Trump reelected, you "dumb fuck"Lol so true. I‚Äôm impartial on it honestly. It‚Äôs clear that the economy and people need help. It was a natural disaster nobody‚Äôs fault so if congress can‚Äôt get their act together I mean what else is he to doI think he needs to declare some emergency, remember when he wanted to do it to get funding for his wall?They became lame ducks in their second term. It's like senate Republicans already think he's done and can't have another term.Ofc. But which side is more reasonable? Those blue dumbfucks want to pass a 3.4T bill filled with random shit.. when the issue at hand is COVID relief. McSally put a clean bill on the floor on COViD, they could‚Äôve negotiates that shit and pass it.. Nahh, they want to pass 3T $.. then they come on tv and bitch about ‚ÄútHeY dOnT wAnT tO hElP oUr KiDs‚ÄùIf Trump issues an executive order to ffederally fund this stimulus, what stops a Democratic president for ordering funding for universal healthcare? Reparations? A golden helicopter? That's how precedent works.I agree 100%. I want to buy puts, but I don't think the market will just crash. JPow already made it clear he's gonna make the USD look like the German Mark post WWI if he has to.the question is when, in 2009 , i thought we were done when $AIG got 750 billion. I thought we were done.

Look where we are now 11 years later.

People were buying seeds in 2009 thinking we were going back to farming.I lost nearly all my wins in May and June (was up almost 400% shorting the drop) thinking the same thing. Learned a valuable lesson about the blind trust people have in the Fed (even after they have fucked up every single thing they have done for the last 50 years). Was worth it. I am a much better trader for it.Have had about 70% of my account in gold futures for a while. Been a good journey so far. Have some small bets short s&p, nasdaq and Tesla, not been paying off hugely, but not pulling down hugely either. Will sell most of the gold futures and build up a massive short once the real spike in usd comes. Thinking end of Q3 ish.I mean, I read your post and I mostly agree with it, but starting off your post with ‚Äúmost of my previous predictions have been wrong, but here‚Äôs what gonna happen...‚Äù isn‚Äôt very convincing lolFair enough! Godspeed and goodluckYeah! Godfather is great, but I feel like it‚Äôs more of a slow burn. Like that lead up in gf 1 when has his dudes straight merc all the enemies while he‚Äôs baptizing his kid.  Such a fucking badass scene, but it wouldn‚Äôt mean as much if you hadn‚Äôt seen the lead up. 

Goodfellas is great too but less subtlety, really a hard choice between themThe request was for a bearish case but i wont disagree with you. As long as the dollar keeps dropping silver will keep rising.Exactly. Options are a form of leverage. You can have huge moves in vakue on a relatively small change in the underlying stock. 

Example is yesterday. FB went up 10% but some contracts went up in value by as much as 50xYeah but the Greeks can really m as with that. That's where theta decay comes in. The value of the contract does down by (theta * 100) every day. So you need to factor that in. Theta ears your gains and so you might end up with FAR less profit if the Greeks aren't in your favor>why sell if stocks will eventually go up

Congratulations, you played yourselfThat bitch needs to do more for meDiamond balls broWell don't kill yourself like that one kidlol it's a shitty penny stock for sureYou got assigned means you sold cash secured putsLol there is a stock split coming up though (I think end of August) so it‚Äôll be easier to enter for us little guys.[hell yeah](https://youtu.be/U2OVBs830wA)Yea ATVI was brutal. This market is nuts. Lost on that one myself.Whoops, just double checked and I have September calls...  I remember I wanted to buy for Oct (since merger is supposed to be completed by end of Q3, but you‚Äôre right, there are none for Oct. so I bought sept).And I have $12.5 calls. Sorry, I hadn‚Äôt looked at them in a while and was going off my clearly shitty memory üòÇExactly where I like them too. I bought in at close todayah ok thanks. what do you like about EMAN?I don‚Äôt even know if they make/lose money or how profitable the business can be but I imagine if you don‚Äôt have to pay car salesmen then your profits increase. I would never buy a car anymore but if I did I‚Äôd go through carvana provided the price was similar to a dealer just to not deal with the salesmenMy fiance works there and they are constantly busy as fuck, didnt lay off anyone and are actually hiring more people throughout this downturn. Besides that I really dont know shit about how well they're doing but all I do know is I hate dealing with car-dealerships and if i were going to get fucked by a car dealer I'd rather just get fucked by buying online.That guy is sociopathic.  The other day they had him on again.  Seems unethical.Shouldn‚Äôt speak to soonokIt says it was like 30,000 at one point lol. (I know reverse split or some shit). How did you know it would explode today?Wtf is up with that 5y chart339p/338c on SPY, only doing next day or few day ICSs, too volatile for my taste right now to do long etI think it‚Äôll keep running because that‚Äôs the future. The fed can subsidize oil all they want but if the future is solar/wind it‚Äôll still increase. It ran this week because solar earnings where VERY goodSounds terrible.4m is 40 years of a 100k salary, if you can't retire off that you're a retardI mean $4M will likely be $8M in 10 years making average market returnsIsnt that from sucession?how do you know it's one entity buying tons of calls from various sellers and not one entity selling tons of calls to various buyers?...wow. There was a 737 crash in India, but it wasn't a MAX (because they're grounded). I don't know. Definitely curious though. I hope whatever BA calls you're holding hit. I'll be watching. =PIt's usually split between employers and employees, but it's really up to the company.Yeah that threw me off too. This week has been somewhat of a mystery and seems like the logic is either out the window or above my understanding.NFL should happen, but it won‚Äôt save it. You should really look at the history of this company. They basically had nothing right when they IPO, fundamentals don‚Äôt mean shit so who knows. But financially they were already pretty fucked.So personally I found this [article](https://medium.com/@Charles_Stover/optimal-file-structure-for-react-applications-f3e35ad0a145) to be a good resource for file organization, I normally use a modified version of this approach. I like having a routes folder (where I store top-level route entry points), components folder (for reusable components), redux folder (for redux reducers/actions/selectors), hooks folder (for hook utility functions), etc. In terms of good open-source examples, my favorite is [this one](https://github.com/oldboyxx/jira_clone/tree/master/client), it helped me learn how to implement my own style system and to organize the different parts of my projects. I'll also plug my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/markoelez), I have some projects you could take a look at if you want, feel free to pm if you need any helpYou‚Äôre hoping for a miracle. How do you do that right? It‚Äôs like flipping a coin.

No, actually it‚Äôs worse than flipping a coin. Because the only result that ends in you profiting is a massive surge EOD. It could it tank. It could just be flat. It could go up but not surge. It could go in circles.

Isn‚Äôt what you‚Äôre talking about basically just FDs? OTM, short dated options that you‚Äôre hoping will moon?Bro all those gimmicks have been tried before. You might win sometimes but eventually it busts. To get any real gains on that you‚Äôll have to put a decent amount of money down on a 0 hour position. Stick to FDs if you want to be a degenerate but they‚Äôre already blowing a majority of accounts as it is, no need to double down on itNot any time soon. If you could make a call on that probably be a bajllionaire.Just depends. RKT is a special case. Huge, well known company that has 'rocket' in its name. Add to that the IPO price was a very accessible, that made it ultra hype. 

For the record, I got my shares right at $18 when it dropped.Oh you're fine theta won't kick in for a while you should be fine unless you literally bought June 8 or whenever before that big dropur already leveraged with ur spy puts

why not 3x ur leverage? accept ur gay & go all inYou‚Äôre good broski, say a prayer of thanks to your guardian angelYes. The tik tok and IG reels reversal of fortune seems like it deserved another 6%+ day. I was shocked it didn‚Äôt bounce back high today even though slight green.It‚Äôs deleted??If there's another red day for SLV I'm getting in. I cashed out on it before today. It probably dropped today because the stimulus seems far from passing. I hope it has a few red days for me to buyin on and then they pass the stimulusI got 20 - 25 Strike calls in oct, nov, dec, might pick up a January next week.  I want to see if science can turn 5k into 50I entered at 200, was just making sure ;)thanks, it's sort of related to COVID because they have touchless car delivery.Sorry, I don't. Just like throwing lean hogs out there randomly. Not available on TW or I'd consider it. I've traded corn, wheat, bonds and currencies so why not.No actually, should I be dumping everything before Jan 2021What is it?Shut the thread down, this guy vouched for me.what's due at signing?wow I‚Äôm hurtI mean it‚Äôs still 14% off and had absolutely no impact, and is on track for its best year ever after having double digit sales growth and raising guidance after an earnings beat

Versus BA which is fucked for years to come and has shit the bed with its military contracts besides one F-15EX contract that was a bone thrown at themPotatoes are literally the best. There, I said it.LolI gave a link with the information he was seeking. You came and talked shit. Not so sure about that name of yours....dude that‚Äôs a terrible trade, you‚Äôre not a MM or some fund who‚Äôs leveraged to the tits. do the maths. You‚Äôre gaining 450 or less in premium. Put up 34 x 334 in capital. SPY hits 341 and you‚Äôre basically 66 x 341 - 34 x 7 - 450 in the hole for the chance to what gain 450 + 34 x 7? you‚Äôre better off doing. you literally have better odds doing any üåà üêª credit spreads and put up less capital. Literally selling the 340 and buying the 341 is a trade that will net $440 with a max loss of $560you don‚Äôt need to hedge gamma until closer to expiration.3 W‚Äôs for me, water, weed and wet(shower) those always cute my hangoversTo each their own own, trophy eyes is young talent - you might like moose blood as well!LOL. Yeah, this is probably being done the retarded way.I wonder if there will be a pullback on monday. Either way, I think what I should have done today was double down when it dipped. I just didn‚Äôt have the balls to. You legit bought ITM calls for BRK-B before earnings and held all the way through?would you say its too late to get in?Noooooo stop. That's too risky.  That shit is bullish for long run always but it may dip for short term before starts to run again.Already itm. That's great!August brings the winds of change entering into the burrr/ cold months.So puts Monday eod thenThoughts on it? Any positions?Yea I‚Äôll probably just sit this one out.

It was good for the overall economy and left it strong for many years still QERecessions are healthy btw. Long bull runs and long Bear markets are bad. Allowing recessions to happen allows newer investors to get a footing. Keeping everything so high only benefits people already positions in the system.

Until you get how he operates it seems like a guy who picked a fight with every other country, his own party, the media, America's intelligence agencies, and the richest people in America while somehow Mr. Magoo-ed his way through it all unscathed. 

In actuality he uses the fact that he has no real principals or political beliefs and a strategy based on constantly and loudly attacking everyone to keep things from sticking to him. Apparently the "always respond to everything with an attack" thing was something he learned from his mentor Roy Coen.

The main reason many sectors are down right is not due to them being correctly valued, but rather a giant sector rotation into tech. XOM not cutting its dividend (effectively doubling it's dividend yield compared to last year) is extremely telling. These companies, and energy in general, are already rebounding and their stock value will reflect that. 

Additionally these are not meme stocks. The IV here is very low. If XOM hits $55 by the end of the year you would 3x your money on ATM calls. It was previously trading at ~70-80 for 5 years pre-covid. The trend is similar for CVX and OKE (as well as BRK.B but that is already coming up and I already made 100%).i see.. didnt know this

*If an employer matches a traditional 401(k) plan contribution, it is standard for it to match one for a Roth 401(k). Unlike the employee's contribution, however, the employer's contribution is placed into a traditional 401(k) plan, and it is taxable upon* [*withdrawal*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/withdrawal.asp)*. The employee's contribution goes into a Roth 401(k).4Ôªø Therefore, many employers have found the additional administrative demands of offering the Roth 401(k) outweigh the benefits to their employees and do not often offer one.*what i would do is take max you need to get full match. then if you have left over money do a backdoor Roth IRA. best of both worlds. Make sure you read how its done so you dont fuk yourself when you do it. 

Free money from match is better than freedom you get with IRA. its risk free money. but if you have enough to fund IRA.. backdoor will do the trick to get bothI don‚Äôt own any stock except for UPS stock.

High volume of puts sold = Bullish
High volume of Calls bought = Bullish
High volume of puts bought = Bearish
High volume of calls sold = BearishIf someone sells 100 calls, someone is really REALLY confident that they won‚Äôt get assigned.  It‚Äôs highly unlikely that someone will buy that many calls from that seller. The person who has more to lose must be very confident - which is why UoA is tracked like this..He was on CNBCI was looking for the same thing, trying to convert over to a wheel strategy from long calls but dont know of any under 30 I would want to try it on.

You probably haven't notice it much because it's been happening our entire "adult" lives (https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/coin_currcircvalue.htm). I'm 29 btw. 

If you look at dollars created 2019 over 2018 it's about 6% vs 7.7% back in 2008 over 2007 (when Bernanke printed more money, 28% more to be exact, 1.7% over 6%), 2020 over 2019 will be much higher than 2019 over 2018's 6% (probably even higher than 2008/2009 7.7%)

Look back at 1999 over 2000 - dollars in circulation went down, therefore the money in your account had more *buying power* since less dollars were in circulation - your dollars are worth more than the year before. Deflation. "Ideally" prices would go down in a deflation scenario.

**TL;DR** you and I don't notice inflation as much because we anticipate cost of goods to go up every single year - like it has been our entire adult lives (You could get a Coca-Cola 20z for 75 cent in the nineties, it's $2 now).No lol. Market going up is primarily driven by US govt action. If the market crashed, the entire global financial system from which America greatly benefits would also crash. 

So again, stop betting against America. 

Also no stimulus news this week is priced in because no one thinks the govt will be dumb enough not to pass it eventuallyIt might. But the markets and wsb are littered with dead bear corpses who tried to time it. 

Do what you want, but I‚Äôd rather make a few bucks than be right, all the billionaires and the govt are trying to prop it up, and I‚Äôm not smart enough to be those dudes in the big shortPeople joined a call?

Better of in $BRK.B or $GS at this pointi really think both of these companies offer a great buy low opportunityTalk to her, and when you do, don‚Äôt frame it like that.

I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre an asshole, but you did something an asshole would do. Show her that you recognize that and it‚Äôll mean a lot.That's not your thing to decide, or even encroach on.  It's encouraging you didn't double down and are actually looking for advice. Just learn from it, dumb social interactions happen all the time.This kind of people don't deserve your attention... Time should be spent on helping the people who care about doing better.

80% fall is just hyperbole and wishful thinking in my
Opinion.People keep mentioning retail but retail investors are a drop in the bucket, they are not responsible for stocks being at ATH. Retail can push up individual stocks but they cannot move the entire market, not by a long shot.I think that means a lot of buyers ready to play, waiting for the news this weekend. I think if we get another dip in cases, effective action on stimulus or believable EOs, plus no sour international news we could take off. We usually don't dip after a flat day, So I'm hoping for a pump day before any sell off- such as the July 2-6 pop after a smooth upward move and level off. Having a weekend could offer more chance for good news to get pent up for Monday. But hey we're just gambling...Exp date and strike? PRPL at 30 this month is like a toss up.How is ford getting reamed by Tesla? Ford sells 5M+ cars a year, they have the most popular vehicle in North America (F-150). Tesla sells under 300k a year. If you look at market cap to judge whose the better auto maker you would be mistaken.if you are right.. ill be buying it there.. but downside momentum has slowed and lets be honest its cheap as fuk.. they are still making tons of money and they still have higher profit margins than AMD.. this is a mature company not a meme stock.. cashflows matter and they pay a dividend.. so there is no way dividend yield on this will be much higher than 3% because yield chasers will be buying this up

also on a macro level judging by foreign market action lately i think foreign markets are starting to see solvency issues and if the market thinks the next stimulus is going to take more than a couple weeks then

1. lot of rent/mortgage is going to be missed and loans will have to be marked underperforming. collateral needs to be posted
2. less brr so metals falter, while at the same time people need to sell pms and equities off to raise collateral and dollar is rising because
3. foreign funds have solvency issues

I don‚Äôt get that drift at all from any article or him speaking lolFlair checks out lol that sucks dude. There will be more opportunitiesQ7. May I repay a coronavirus-related distribution?


A7. In general, yes, you may repay all or part of the amount of a coronavirus-related distribution to an eligible retirement plan, provided that you complete the repayment within three years after the date that the distribution was received. If you repay a coronavirus-related distribution, the distribution will be treated as though it were repaid in a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer so that you do not owe federal income tax on the distribution.

If, for example, you receive a coronavirus-related distribution in 2020, you choose to include the distribution amount in income over a 3-year period (2020, 2021, and 2022), and you choose to repay the full amount to an eligible retirement plan in 2022, you may file amended federal income tax returns for 2020 and 2021 to claim a refund of the tax attributable to the amount of the distribution that you included in income for those years, and you will not be required to include any amount in income in 2022. See sections 4.D, 4.E, and 4.F of Notice 2005-92 for additional examples.


sounds like if you dont pay back in 3years you pay taxes only?Shockingly no mandantory withholding with COVID changes.

Goal is to make money and not to console self or ask for support once one loses money. I lost plenty myself but you learn from mistake and adjust and remember goal is to get better and make money and not to downplay losses.

Sometimes a little patience is a make or break.daymn,, im new to it but im mainly targeting some of my favorite japanese albums and electronic music such as vaporwave and suchI think I‚Äôm going to put my couch in storage to help make this happen.That's true, although freezing to death doesn't sound horrible rnYou mean keep a tighter SL ? I mean that's what has fucked me for a whileYa, my bad. Forget to write Theta. IV too but Theta mostly.I probably should have explained better, but when the beaches are packed, they spending money are restaurants and shit. Galveston is the big beach area for us, I‚Äôve been down there a few times this summer and the damn island is about to sink under the waves due to all the retards like myself there.

Lots of our bars and night clubs have been trying to reclassify as ‚Äúrestaurants‚Äù to stay open too, and apparently it‚Äôs working. 

I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a lot of economic issues, especially since some of our oil companies are having issues, but fr it‚Äôs poppin‚Äô down here. 

We are not a smart speciesWorks for me lolLmaooo!! Then there‚Äôs ‚Äúthe scream‚Äù when our calls tankSigns point to QQQ gap up mondayThanks man. I am little new on options side but have done some homework and so was curious to see if I am missing something. I know it also depends on Greeks but the way I have been looking at it is math based on price action and seeing what the profit % would be at target price (premium / profit per share) knowing very well that it would be probably higher given the greeks. I guess the main thing is whether we are right in our analysis on direction of price movement in the time slot we buy calls in. Let me know if I missed out on something . Good luckThere is a 1 hour delay fetching comments.

they are absurdly rich.I think they‚Äôre smallmouth, but I don‚Äôt really know much about fishingBuy a beginners set of rod and tackle and get a small to medium size blade bait.

one risk to consider is european covid cases. if those tick up the short dollar trade also makes less sense. currently spain cases are mooning but everyone else is under control. if we see it take off in germany and UK then watch outThat's what I'm saying someone should do before they shine their phone light into their anus and post the product onlineNo gimmick here.

Right??? FuckThey don't want to loan money to the unemployed people with debt, that's indeed too risky. They want to loan money to people with good cashflow and no debt. But those people will only take loans when interest rates are low enough.I can see where your coming from but make no mistake USD cannot go up.Real or not , those are some of the most legendary threads in wsb history.6.9/10I got lucky my waifu is American and is not like your average thot American girl.Prostitutes are the way to go brother. The cheaper the better8th gradeAh, lost all unrealized gains? Happened to me this morning but FB saved the day.Obviously, they realized that using the term trade war was not popular, so instead they stopped using the term and changed it to ‚Äúwe are standing up for human rights and prevent China from stealing our data‚Äù. And mouth breathers in the US ate it all up, Rs and Dems are both victims of the propaganda. It‚Äôs sad to see that truth are so rare these days, and I think deep down ppl know they are being fed propaganda, but they realized they don‚Äôt actually care, because it feels so good to ‚Äúpwn‚Äù China and Gen Zs that truth is just what‚Äôs standing in the way. If you want the truth, you aren‚Äôt a patriot, this is a dangerous fucking path we are heading down on.Maybe, but everyone is jumping on the bandwagon and banning Huawei 5G equipment lol. Based on what evidence? That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm saying they are doing the same thing to TikTok based on no evidence either. They realize that stupid retards who wants an entity to blame all their failures on aren‚Äôt very big on evidence and critical thinking. Your comments just proved my point.oof yeah. i mean for awhile there it was pretty flat and between QQQ trying and going green once..I hope we both winSo true. We are both gonna hit 10 baggers. Good luck!!do it! u'll be driving in an upgraded car soonBest $10 I spend a month.So that's not letting it in is it you moron.

‚ÄúThe S&P 500‚Äôs committee does meet monthly, and could potentially make changes to the index‚Äôs constituents then, but the firm could not confirm by press time when the next meeting would take place; it also rebalances the index each quarter, and could swap companies in and out then, but that‚Äôs not scheduled to happen until Sept. 21

Hedging.That‚Äôs a very good point. It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in the euphoria. The artificially held low is that guy‚Äôs theory, but I‚Äôm prepared for it to trade sideways.

I still need my local nonprofit news outlet and KEXP. Though how cheap Spotify is I've always been tempted to buy in. However with all this pandemic going on I don't really spend much time going around needing music on demandLmao.. that it is.. but if I could buy Starlink and SpaceX stock I would be. Currently got to settle for Maxar Technologies.There's no irony when I openly called myself arrogant, but nice try. Of course, creators are selfish and seeking validation. What an utterly useless thing to state. Would you prefer your favorite musicians and writers to create and then just throw it away? Nonsense.Don't get me wrong. I'm not a Biden fan at all. I'm just saying voters are about as rational as the markets. Biden won the nomination by sweeping southern black voters who remember him as Obama's VP. I don't think they were carefully assessing his debate performances or policy positions.

Although I'm not sure what the "telling" point is supposed to be either. Dems chose Biden because politicians are lazy?You can‚Äôt see it?This is the text

So here‚Äôs how earnings can change a life :


https://imgur.com/gallery/k7HNCRn . Before earnings down -120k

Now after earnings : https://imgur.com/gallery/DSvZteQYou are super adorbs. I‚Äôm not sure if you clownin which is hilarious or an actual micro penis mega insecure alpha kook cuck. Either way, great work.it's just a dad joke bro lol, lore is for more sophisticated punch lines, not for dad punchlines tbh

edit: i guess you could modify slightly to something like "doctor, this lizard keeps climbing on my head" or something along those lines. that'd make the lizard a little weird if the second you set him down he just climbs right back up on your head

edit 2: but then why he go to doctor and not vet? fuck, see now you gotta change too much stuffRight and for no reason. Thing is, the more it works, the more people will get into it, which means it will work more. Qqq in two years won't be 45% Facebook Amazon Google Microsoft and apple, it will be 85%...Mainly selling weeklies with the wheel here. Why do you choose monthlies?Honestly my only guess.they can build their own website.  Facebook is free to join but it has terms of service.  facebook is like a mall, free to enter but it is still private property, not a public space.the comment also it would make everyone livid.  Greenland is harsh, difficult place to live.  Giving descendents of slaves acres of land in green land is like When the USFL sued the NFL and won but was awarded one dollar.    Other People are not happy about descendents of slaves being giving something as reparations.Oof sorry man. I had work meetings coming up so I was feverishly trying to calculate limit buys I could leave up. Think it turned out ok minus the first one, jumped in a bit too soonNah starting from Season 6 of u/visionarymind he starts doing it its canonA couple t-shirts and coffee mugs along with some 3D renders and you're all set. Lemme know when you make it happen. Im already Bullish.I resent you calling me a lobster money clownYou pretty explicitly said the demise of America all started when women got the right to vote. Wouldn‚Äôt that imply you think if women hadn‚Äôt gotten the right to vote that America wouldn‚Äôt be experiencing its demise?lol youre not going to become permanently psychotic. take a tab and stay indoors, better with friends that you trustyou can take a microdose and be in a happy state of mind and have lots of fun. Don‚Äôt drop 2 tabs or some crazy shit.Don‚Äôt do it alone for the first time in the middle of the ocean on a festival cruise ship... trust meYou made more than alot more today, than some people, including me.Creme de la creme of FDs. 30%+ OTM too.

good luck to both of us! üíÅüí∞üëçless money printing....... bro the fed itself has shelled out double the govt stimulus, alot of their programs haven't even started. Money continues to flow in. Silver hasnt even gotten close to the rally gold has been on.

people as always during economic uncertainty will flock to precious metals not too stocks. more money printing will have people flocking to stocks.

precious metals literally win no matter what.Why are his comments upvoted and yours downvoted?  If you don't know why silver price goes up you probably shouldn't be buying lmao.I use E*TradeHahahaha yeah Frank covers it I think maybe but it‚Äôs made famous by Dean, hell yeah bro! Just give me greenJust tell your loan provider you can‚Äôt pay, easy as that. I haven‚Äôt paid credit cards in 4 months"going to" extend it.

And 100 shares5C 8/21. Get in early Monday AM before it gets too pumped.I hope so price dropped for no reason so this should give it a kick in the assI wouldn‚Äôt mind it being as simple as mindlessly buying travel company puts way otm again lolüëëUpdate: I researched some more and now it‚Äôs all but confirmed by Bloomberg to be Canoo. Still a good pick. Monday may be a roller coaster up or down. Hold on tight!I literally just saw that. Another solid pick after Proterra. It was an after hours story. Hopefully it‚Äôs stagnate so you can jump aboard, and it takes off after confirmed by both partiesFucking shit lately. Im trying to break evenhttps://i.imgur.com/0m8xHLP.jpg*moonYeah, I made and lost a whole lot scalping /es puts today. By EOD I had lost way more but I made some back and the end and almost ended up back green on the day.Haha okay thanks dude, yeah Old Guard is next on my listIt will be a bumpy ride but it will be rewarding. If you are sceptical buy in the dips but silver may go to 50 so when you get in let it ride as long as you can.jade lizardhmm maybe ill consider a bullish bias iron condor. see how monday looks.We don't talk about it herei don't break the rules cause i end up getting banned. read between the lines ^(or rule #3)This is as good an "explanation" as I've seen.

If you don't think he'll do it, that's fine, but the long rambling list of shit he said he's doing is nothing like Obamacare.How many of those are actually done by brokers though? The revenue is different and less for those than for a wholly originated mortgage from the RKT platformMacy‚Äôs I think will wind up like Sears. Drag on for years.

Excuse me as i go inhale my own ass gasMaybe, who knows. I hate chasing, especially assets that go parabolic. Either price comes to where I want to buy or it doesn't. I have yet to see price of an asset go up that fast and not have a decent drop but maybe silver is different.

I might consider buying around $23.90ish if it gets there but ideally, sub $23.Trust me I raged hard. She straight up told me to keep trying.

I had to make up some story that I‚Äôm having a hard time having condom sex since my breakup as I‚Äôm use to raw sex.

I bought 3 8/28 205c for $220 each and sold for $525 each. Might have made over $880 each.

Good luck on Monday.Interest rates are crazy low. Refinancing should be through the roof, especially given how many people have paid off their credit cards during COVID and improved their credit ratings.

Not to mention the fact that once COVID calms down we're going to see a mass exodus from cities. Especially if Trump wins. After months of rioting lots of those who can afford it are going to flee to the burbs.This. Idk why companies like Amazon and Google don‚Äôt want to split their stock also so that they can lower their barrier to entry to own stock.That shits hilariousYa Fck this weekI‚Äôm 6‚Äô0+ hbu?Yup. Executive Power just kept growing under both parties, until we elected the guy who claims he can do anything he wants on the reg.We surely agree everything after 9/11 was bad. I get your argument. My point is the next four months are a turning point, an actual honest-to-God attempt for one man to seize power. Trump is setting up many paths to simply reject the election results, and his party will back it. 

The roots go back to 9/11 but Trump had nothing to do with the set up, he just waltzed in and took advantage of a laughably weak system.They finished <.15% green, so in other words they finished flat. Travel and pharma finished flat as well. Tech companies that had the wildest runs in the last 2 months are the ones hurting the most today. My point was is that they'll all bounce backFair enough. I hope others agree with you. I'd love to be able to get my bets in before it actually happens.I worked my ass off the past 2 years to put myself in a position where I don‚Äôt need to work üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èBut that involves work?Can't hate on awd.It's under sports, go to all sports and there's a politics tabhttps://i.imgur.com/9TRH78U.jpghell yeah, MS is the shitwhat‚Äôs ur positions?Yea I don‚Äôt follow much of trumps policies but I can say when it comes to insurance at least for the elderly I mostly deal with Medicare it has gotten better for them and cheaper overallTry 'Inside Job'. Totally worth it.No cans do-ville babydollI feel like its kinda cliche but Cosmo's Factory is so goodBro it literally gives me chills, I love that song so muchWell any kind of money is life changing. But my account is down to only 4K. Down like 90% being retarded. So yeah. I don‚Äôt deposit money. Just trading with my initial deposit. I might develop a gambling problem. Shit I might already have one.Did you try fucking them?Nah I just mean $10k is not that much to me and I have lost/gained a magnitude higher than that in a day and even then money isn't the biggest things I've lost in my life before but it seems lame to write something like that on this forum for autists lolGood 4 uI think you'll be fine. You could sell some weeklies against your calls on a pop to recoup some losses while you wait. But yea was surprised to see it fall so hard after it already got wrecked 2 days ago.some bullshitThat makes sense. Thank you for explaining!(:Life expectancy after first dose is 18 months.Yes. Spread wordIf you point out most successful places are islands (NZ, Iceland) they‚Äôre just like LOOK AT TRUMP AND THE USA WE CLOSED NO 2022 NO DRRR NO NO BYE J J J JACINDA IS A GENIUSFake and gay report. Makes sense. Russian one makes way more senseYou are stupid lol

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-07/u-s-intelligence-agencies-say-china-iran-want-trump-to-lose?srnd=premium&sref=yjNh6QgJYa I don‚Äôt blame the guy for trying, and it might work out for him, I‚Äôm pretty neutral on the move myself but I gotta say long term, I don‚Äôt like how much power he is seizing for the Executive branch, I like my presidents to be powerless figureheads.Ya thinking back to that is why I‚Äôm sure he won‚Äôt be stopped, still a bummer to have the checks and balances be shit on so hard tho IMO. 

Conservatives will cheer it on until a Dem tries to take advantage the same way and then they‚Äôll regret it.Damn true. Everybody got a silly agenda when the government‚Äôs job is to SERVE THE PEOPLE. So many go into it for the wrong reasons sadlyHave you even looked into what he actually plans to do? Fuckin aye..Yeah I lost 6 figures and I was up well over 5000%. It‚Äôs all fake money and we‚Äôre all gonna be in the same boat soon anyway.Most of my previous predictions have not been wrong. I was all in on Apple calls last summer, Visa calls in fall (my only other mistake), Amazon calls in November-January, SPY puts in February, and QQQ puts in May-August was what took me out. I‚Äôm not trying to justify myself to anyone, I don‚Äôt care what people think about me, my predictions, or my trades.

My philosophy is high risk/high reward and I look where no one else does. Sometimes that means big losses but that also means insane gains. The data told me that QQQ is in a bubble, I didn‚Äôt think it was sustainable for this long but it was. My biggest issue is timing, not analysis. That was my problem with Visa too, after I dumped my calls it skyrocketed over the next two months to higher than my price target. The market doesn‚Äôt see things as quickly as it should.Man. Now i see that I sold my apple calls for 48% profit after the pop and then it ended up to be 4x my price and i missed it even though there wasn‚Äôt major pop but consistent upward momentum for next few daysI don‚Äôt think you get itWe‚Äôll see monday...Nawh my loss was like $23 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èhaha no worries, thanks for the clarification. what kind of PT do you have in mind for merger by the way?The chart. Priced moved up on huge volume that's been sustained. I don't know anything about the company though lolI feel you. I still have over a month for my C IC. Hoping next week undoes all the gains Citigroup gained today.Usually if volume jumps from 5-10 a day to 1000 for just one day it was 1 person or group buying the options.

If that happens then the company would be liable for taxes you technically owe?Yeah I don't get it either, I'm just going with the trend of mindless bullishness until proven otherwise. Thinking we'll see a rotation into the sectors that really got fucked by covid ie small cap because evidence of actual economic recovery seems to be mounting.Double down until it happensI'm going to do itI got in at 18 but I ended up buying more later in the low 20s. I should have gotten more initially but I had a bid set at 16 thinking it would dip early on that obviously never went off.I believe I figured it out. I went full retard when I switched thinking from buying to selling.I feel as if ill buy in and it will have topped out. Way late to the party I feelDamn, that will print 100%. I have no doubt airlines are going to go up soon. I have to get on thatNiceYeah, I see people mentioning lean hog on here but sounds more like a meme thing rather than anything serious.~$3500, which I feel is actually kinda steep 

Never leased a car before so Idk what‚Äôs typical. Imma do more research tn$4.5KI was kidding skank, and what of my name? You done learning?Just delta hedge each day and you can't lose unless there's a big move right?Okie dokie. Say we were closer to expiry, what do?they remind me a little of polar bear club. i'll have to give er a few listens to get used to themI bought BRKB 200 calls last week so was close to the money.  The market moved towards me. I made $9k. I think the same play me be available for WMT.

Want so you think.Don‚Äôt think so. Still happy holding my shares. But I‚Äôm operating under assumption IoT and 5G take off and the demand is heavy. I‚Äôm very bullish on tech, but I‚Äôm not sure how long 5G and IoT proliferation will take, one reason I like 0 theta of shares with these.I bought it today. If I make $100 I'll sell. AAPL was down big today. Hope that Wechat nonsense isn't true.Downvote for repeat commentI've been bullish on NIO for a while, hold 351 sharesYeah playing it safe is a good idea, never know with electric vehicle companies tooThanks a lot I will check it out.I like when Kernan calls Sorkin out for being a spoiled brat. One time Sorkin was talking about how he worked hard as a kid and how he knows the struggle of the working man...and he had to admit it was some cushy job his dad got him and he basically did nothing and got paid.I have 40% of my account in LOW 9/18 160c and 165c.Irrelevant to my point and intel absolutely deserved to drop like an anchor after that earnings call.40%I belong here üòÖGirls butt cracks have such a strong arousing odor and it‚Äôs not the scent of poop lolProbably quit trading. But I‚Äôll go down swinging.It‚Äôs actually super comforting to know that you‚Äôve at least clawed your way back to initial investment. I would consider that a victory at this point.Okay moron.Where you living at? Like what country?Fuk uU must be new.You do realize there‚Äôs still billions of dollars sitting on the sidelines waiting to get into the market right? And the market is not entirely dependent upon stimulus. Look at today for example. We may see 320‚Äôs again but we won‚Äôt see a drop like we did in March. Tech is literally holding up the market right now, name me a reason why tech would fail?Yeah, that was in the 50s. Insane growth. US hasn't been growing much since mid 60sFinished off my last kilo last night sorry ü§ìthis is the waySo that's why the fedbois have been asking my neighbors about me! They want to make sure I'll be home when they drop by with the huge check and the cameras.Bro you're not even on my level, I'm the Peter Jackson of dick pics. With angles and clever lighting my dick is Gandalf and the evidence of my last herpes outbreak is a hobbit.Is it for the same things being negotiating? Why didn't he just do it sooner instead of wait for a bunch of babies to bicker over whether or not people deserve a few hundred bucks?Silvers volume was the highest in 6+ months. Golds volume is just below its highest volume in the last couple months. Demand is still there with all of the new traders flooding the marketYou mean metals can't go parabolic forever? I was expecting gold to be over 9000 within 2 weeks.

But seriously, both gold and silver hit a crucial resistance. Just not sure how big of a correction this will be. Hoping for sub $25 silver and sub $1950 gold, ideally sub 1900.Hard to tell. A month or so ago it was trading less than a dollar a share and now sits at 3.59 so eps should be good but I‚Äôm not sure about revenue. I could see company‚Äôs and hospitals jumping all over the new drug and new contracts for them but don‚Äôt know if it would go towards this quartercharts and volume profileVery legal, and very coolI never wanted 'to be anything' i just always knew i wanted to be happy and financially stable, and i have that

I don't even have to work until spring of 2021 when I get my job back. I already paid my rent until July 2021. Got an extra 5k to live off of until then and enough money to play more with options. I haven't even touched drugs since the beginning of 2020. I'm just splooging on this week's gainsIm talking about the gold market, not the stock market.
edit: and stagflation was not caused by what you mention, you are wrong.It's like saying exercise doesn't feel good in the moment, but sets you up for the future. This country is now an 800 pound obese man butt-welded to a sofa. They'll have to get a crane to move him.> Unless I'm drunk.Cuz you retard

Lol this guy reported me. Goodbye wsbPostedYea it‚Äôs posted big dawgHe is crazy in a way that hurts us. He's getting involved in an election as only a spoiler, he literally cannot win. He will not be on enough state ballots to win 270 electoral votes if he won all those states. he is literally only working for trumpYa 60% is near impossible. Maybe if they cash out like what Bezos did. But not many have that luxuryI just need one day and I'm out. Need my 1k to get back to a few more.I'm starting to get a weird feeling. Everyone seems to be insinuating he's planning something gay. Like 8 different commenters. I think I need to back out asapYeah I did crack onceSolid dd. Respek for that. I‚Äôm gonna 100% disagree though because market doesn‚Äôt do logical right now and sentiment drives markets. Short term your ticks down, mid term flat, maybe up from short term lows, long term pfffffffffThankfully my company does offer a Roth. It is weird though.I value the minds of Tom Lee and Jeffrey Gundlach the mostSo overvalued though!Tech looks gay recently what's up with that?It's nice to visit but to live and work there is shitty and crazy difficultThanks for the reply. What do you do in Tokyo, if you don't mind me asking?
Can you speak Japanese? If no, how difficult is it to by with only English?Lol so you proved my point. You think Donald Trump is good for the world? Does it hurt to be this retarded?Politically it was a genius move. Backed the Dems into a corner by threatening to take their own positionsI'm standing for delivery this month no need to thank me go ahead and get your calls in now boysCause I like money bitchHere you go bro. It‚Äôs hella worth it. https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/switching-chrome-firefoxyeah. they fixed it in 2018 and made it efficent while chrome has been bloated since 2015. it's worth going backüë®‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë®Oh so you are retardedYou‚Äôre right on that end. Although I would argue with Apple having the stock split coming up and their new iPhone and 5g‚Äôs rolling out October/November with this bull run I‚Äôll be making profit. Sure it‚Äôs not guaranteed but at this point it‚Äôs the most relatively generally upward going stock in the marketWhat's your definition of "distant future"?>Avg 190. I should have sold so much quicker

A bit high but I'm fairly sure its going to $200 within 2-3 weeks. It's a beaten down blue chip just like DIS. If DIS can get to $130, BA can get to $200.Lol thanks, I will post any gains on this postdollar will no longer be killSame, I wanna load up some more. 87 mil float with 20 mil shorted. 1 bil market cap with an impending 6 bil order. Ticking time bomb üí£üí•ü§ØI see, it‚Äôs a measure of net confidence: one super bear vs 10 semi bulls nets out for the bear. Thx. Do we know if it‚Äôs possible that a MM can hold enough of the stock to sell so the calls are otm? Or in this case does the seller just think the sample size of 60 is too small to justify the optimism over the tests near perfect specificity and sensitivity. Or could it just be an algo bot and there‚Äôs no human? (I‚Äôm in the stock deep and a little worried)Just got done reading the article on marketwatch.  I so hope he's right haha.

But honestly I feel like a fool even more because I honestly don't even realize AAL had a 20% run up from M-F. I started watching it yesterday afternoon  since my focus has been on tech this week for earnings. Then forgot about it until EOD and put the 3.5k in last minute. Wouldn't have done that had I seen the good run up all week. 

Oh well! Only time will tellI will thanksI‚Äôm guessing your not talking about cash puts thenBought GLD 185/180 Put spreads first few mins at open.Yes, I believe that the short dollar/long equities derivative trades that funds put on after the Fed will cause the dollar to rally faster than normal. /GC put in a nice bearish engulfing candle to finish the day, and spot gold will do some damage to the late retail futures buyers.Oh ok sick. Thx homieHopeful wishing lol. I know that's what they say, but last 2 times I've been able to trade by market open, which was fkn awesome. But I haven't played with futures in a bit, so idk. I'd suck their cocks if they hooked me up by Sunday. I hope you're wrong! Lol, thanks homienoiceHow do you remember it and I don't....100 fsly 230 msftThat's what I'm eyeing - surge 6". Do you get the ones with the liners? Are the shorts with liners meant to be worn without underwear?A "very small minority found her attractive."  I'm not sure if this is an insult or a compliment.

Good god it‚Äôs terrifying in thereLol yep I would definitely come in the middle of the night and force you outYep figuresBut a whole lot of people couldn't buy for years. If you want to rent forever, fine, but mortgage terms will be stricter and an eviction and possible lawsuit will look bad for a long time.Lol.  I love this sub.

https://twitter.com/carlquintanilla/status/1290254387000954880?s=19Yeah and they clearly leaked the info early as well.that's not what I said, I said more than 3000 people died from 9/11 and comparing corona virus to 9/11 is stupidHe suggested wearing goggles. That‚Äôs what I read. I don‚Äôt think he had designs for a mandate. I‚ÄômWho da fuck is he.....um him stfuCare to explain? My textbooks always underscored that aggregate demand i.e stimulus is, you know, deeply concerning for marketsYa I grabbed 210s so I just need it to not drop and I‚Äôm already happyDriven by US govt action, that's the point. WW3 could break out and they'll keep pushing the markets up. As long as things are bad, they will have a reason to keep the printers on.

Stimulus or no stimulus, if they don't want it to drop, it's not dropping.You are not wrong. I picked up some far OTM puts today to cover my long positions just in case. RTX has become my de facto savings account lately due to their dividend so I'm not hoping for a crash.

Expecting a lot of bear posts this weekend though.He knows damn well it will get held up in court.  There is nothing that will help unemployed people in reality. So yeah they will get nothing.ü§îüá∫üá∏Be careful on this one... there might be better calls to write than precious metals.Holy fucking shit dude that‚Äôs what‚Äôs up. People raising their noses at this kind of stuff but will buy DIS puts with their own moneyLol ok buddy you're probably brand new.  I can tell you in my entire trading career I have never seen a stock go from $0.01 to $0.00 but sure budWhy are you even talking about buyers you just put it into the RH system and it goes back into the systemDelisting from what?Oil is not a stockokay okay thank you. this is what i wanted to know.Not if I don‚Äôt put 22k in I guess19, LAI will try to get better in my own life, I'm just reflecting on ideas and such, I'm not doing anything today for a few more hours, I just wonder why and how I do some things, and why I feel so different than others and how I've failed, I'm a failure, and I doubt it'd change no matter what, I have technically succeeded in the market, but it doesn't change the way I feel, nothing will. My life has changed drastically from say, 8 months ago, well, 8 months ago I had planned  my death for a couple months, but an unexpected surprise happened, I got snap before the day, the day before my 18th birthday. It is all very strange how life ends up working.

There could be a drop, but I‚Äôm focused on long game since I can‚Äôt liquidate my holdings, and so sticking to covered calls to hedge as much as possible. Ideally for me, we are just flat, which I also think is a very realistic scenario[deleted]Stop. You're making me sad.it was just some of the phrasing he used.  still talkin about "if they cant come to an agreement im gona do this" instead of saying "they havent come to an agreement so im gona do this".  then he said it was possible for an EO by the end of the week, but the context made it seem like he meant the upcoming week, after more negotiations, not literally today.  i will be pleasantly surprised if he actually just pulls the triggerAll good. Added a contract, made a chunk back, closed that one and have more riding over the weekend. Still up from yesterday morning though.Yep, that‚Äôs how a coworker explained it to me.

It's similar to Top Gear. Just long term.

The sub r/vandwellers is a huge sub with tons of information and posts on people doing just that.

I recently got a drone :) Seen so many countless incredible places. And the majority has just been driving around CA, OR, and WA. I can't even fathom the things I'd see if I wasn't limited to just a week at a time.It's all good. I don't mean to retire in a year, I'd like to get to $10M in savings in a reasonable amount of time though. I have $1.6M now, so a decade of 20% YoY growth will get me there, without factoring in additional savings. A portfolio won't survive a decade with a yolo mindset, I know that.Nah loosen them a bit if that‚Äôs what‚Äôs fucking you it should be the max loss you‚Äôre willing to take not the min shit needs to play out a bitTheta is gonna kill you on weeklies so play monthlies, they still move plenty and if your confident in short term action, play 0dt, which have no theta and basically all delta.Looks like I'm losing more money lolWholesomeOur calls are safe bb. Bears gonna get slaughteredCan I call you cute then? UwUI have degrees in both finance and economics lol.There‚Äôs no science to support thatYeah .22 a great fun gun.

Shitting 4-5 times a day and drinking water near non-stop but feels amazing.im with you on this also.. inflation risks are lower than the doom and gloomers make it out to be..

agreed on the covid cases.. goldman's counter argument (they are still bearish USD) is based on at least one vaccine being available by end of year and USD real rates going further into the negative.. i think deviation from that vaccine timeline is what im watching out forWe all should. Can't hurt! Not the last part but we should all work out more.$RH is trying to change their reputation from a bunch of people losing money on YOLO to "long term investors" that they mentioned in the video. I don't think $RH can do it, may as well release a 2nd app at this point, can't lipstick a pig (the name *Robinhood*).I feel you, theta railed me Thursday but I held til Friday and sure enough! Got back in with some 8/21s and 8/28s eod today. Tendy festival next week.The guy asked if we would want to live in Europe. I really like Europe, but have a different love for the United States. If most of your own family got wiped out in a certain way, it would probably be an important part of who you are too - I'm named after someone that was murdered, and it's a huge part of how my parents were raised.

Not sure why the salt.Thanks! One way or another something is going to pop.Hey! He asked me! üò°3rd partyNot a huge amount of difference between them substantively. I notice a lot of people here actually take what they say seriously, so for instance they‚Äôll think Biden would be a socialist, whatever that means, when in reality these politicians don‚Äôt really do anything. 

They‚Äôre all benefiting from the status quo, Democrat and Republican. They have to talk big to get their base to vote for them, but they aren‚Äôt super interested in actually doing what they talk about.

Don‚Äôt take politics seriously and look past the ‚Äúteams‚Äù of r and d, and realize they‚Äôre both just in it for money and don‚Äôt care about usReally‚ùî

üëÅ wood üëâüëå just for the üí≤experience[deleted]LOL same. I usually don‚Äôt do leaps, but I‚Äôm trying to change ü§£ otherwise I‚Äôll slowly piss away my roth on FDs and purple mattresses. After PRPL earnings I‚Äôm evenly splitting my account into about 6 leaps. BRK, MSFT, AMD, TSM, ATVI, and should probably though some airlines or cruise lines in thereTrue but if you‚Äôre broke enough to where you can‚Äôt afford the 25k for Robinhoods daytrading i think the benefit outweighs thatMake a transfer with whatever you want to play, then disable margin. You can then daytrade as often as you like. 

You still have to wait for funds to clear before trading again which can be a couple days, but as long as you're day trading 25% of your total cash you'll never notice.Credit score stays fucked for 7 years regardless of whether the debt was payed off or not.

Edit: ty for motivation thoWell, I got an MS degree in Finance, then decided that shit is fun for myself but less so with red tape, so I got another MS degree in comp sci, and that's fantastic. I was briefly a software engineer and now I'm a data scientist. I really like my job, it pays well and part of my job is literally automating decision making. It's *my job* to be "lazy", which I really enjoy.If it is, and it stays there, it will be as a result of a significant and broader market movement. I‚Äôm going to keep selling calls at the 100 and 105 range into that move, I think. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll see 95, but who knows.Lmaooo! Didn‚Äôt bud have that ad awhile back that was like ‚Äúreaaaaalll men of genius‚Äù and then they saluted the deli meat slicer? We the real men of geniusInteresting, certainly worth looking into. I tend to trust my ears over a correspondent because they're so often wrong, but it's not as if Trump speaks very clearly. 

And it's cool, I assume we're all drinking away the red day. Have a good time bro.Oh I'm all fucked up. I know that.I'll definitely check it out fam üëåOh sorry, that came across wrong. I just meant if Apple drops like that everyone is screwed.

I do think the investment thesis is specious though - they have greater risk of disruption over the long term than many mega caps because of their business concentration in effectively one product. Their high P/E implies investors are banking on truly sustained growth, even at rights higher than what they're growing today.GUHd üÖ±Ô∏èü§ñ‚úùÔ∏èThat‚Äôs awesome thanks, gonna play around with the scanner todayRate mine  https://i.imgur.com/HPeZCML.jpgNiceHas she met ‚ù§Ô∏è2Ô∏è‚É£üçÜüíçüë∞ yet‚ùì

üòàüëäüëäüî•üî•üî•üíØLovely how you are too shy to speak up üòªYeah my 8/14 APPL calls have a break even price of 446 so I literally couldn‚Äôt sell. Only thing that breaks me now is if it goes back to the 430‚Äôs which I don‚Äôt ever see happening. We‚Äôll seeI mean, i am not denying China gov/companies arent spying on users, they surely are. Just like USA is.

&#x200B;

Its all about USA vs CHINA, who will get the most of the global market share. And USA keeping their status as an "Empire".>based on what evidence


The evidence that Trump wants the world to use American tech and not ChineseHaha yeah, woops.Letting it in and getting it to the point it‚Äôs at you idiotGee, if you want to take it that far, why not just tax 100% of everyone's paychecks for SS then?  Better yet, why don't you give away all your money to them since you "care" that much?  Or are you one of those slacktivists who feels good by telling everyone else to donate for you?That‚Äôs was fine circus turned me off the serious for a long time.Already lost so much money on Tesla 25k+, scared to catch the falling knifeThis is why I lean heavily right already anyways. Taxes suckWhen did you buy it for .4. You're already up big?*penny stocks are pump and dumps....Probably not a bad play, the big dogs definitely know something we don‚Äôt know.I think the stimulus is weeks away not next week. Maybe the week of the 21st. 

Today showed that there are huge issues with talks. Market did not care because trump leaned on executive orders so we know money is coming and we don‚Äôt care how. Timing this play is the problem.Hope not for my SLV callsBecause I had Hibiki 21? Fuck off, It's past your bedtimeIm hedging against profits ideitBig brain shit right hereIs that what he said? I didn't watch the video but I've listened to enough perma gold bulls to know that's one of the things they believe. 

Just looked at what silver did in 2011 when it ran from $17 to almost $50. If silver goes up as fast as it did back then, it would take until next July for it to get back to $50.

Just noticed back in 1979, it went from $10 to $40 even faster before tanking back down to $10. If we use that speed, then $50 by end of Dec this year.

We do have record money printing now so who knows, maybe this time it doesn't tank afterward.Hahahahaha true to both perspective .. also it‚Äôs game of patience, mindset, emotions and smartness. That‚Äôs the reason people judge themselves. It‚Äôs a good way to earn income and build wealth if we are discipline and skilled. Doesn‚Äôt need to best at it, need to be in control of emotions and disciplineNo matter how rock hard you might be for silver, never tell your wife she's your silver medal.  Mine knows how banging my SLV shit is right now, and understood the context, and it still ended not well.Fuck Cuomo. I hate him and DiBlasioThe latter. Sry deleted previous comment cuz I said the exact same thing in another one. The number of homeless people on the streets are increasing exponentiallyPuts on Paris it is, we hate the French anyway!> perhaps arrogantly

See, you didn't even try.

The daily threads have thousands of comments. Rich of you to repost *yours* because not everyone reads them all. What if we were all doing that?It was a pretty clear move for the Democratic Party to have Klobuchar and Pete drop out in the last days prior Super Tuesday to support Biden. Its a move to support the status quo, rather than the change that is increasingly necessary in this country.Bro
I put my pants üëñ one leg at a time 


üòàüòàüî•üòáHowsa bout: doc, this lizard keeps climbing on my head and starts licking my scalp. I can't set him down for more than a few seconds before he climbs back up there. Is it dandruff?"

"No, your scalp looks healthy, no lice or anything. You might just have a reptile dysfunction."Bubbles always pop. Out of that list, I‚Äôm only down with Microsoft.I‚Äôm not wheeling, selling against long held shares. Monthlies have a good balance for me of hitting a desired rate of return on the holding, while offering more ‚Äúinsurance‚Äù without giving up too much IV. 

My goal is to protect my portfolio right now as much as it is to build value. A weekly option just doesn‚Äôt offset much of a loss. 

Do you find weekly works best with the wheel?I recommend you don't read up the numerous court decisions saying malls can't ban free speech, because they are quasi public squares.The whole point of the joke is it is just about the worst way to handle any of those situations,which meana there is 25% trump will try to do it.Hopefully can make some up with my 9/18 calls but some of the tech weeklies I have I may be hoping to just get back to evenA t-shirt printing company for Harley Davidson merch that is less than 50 miles from me got 3 million in PPP. I will just open with 100 shares and let the bidding war begin.I think there are unintended consequences to everything including good things that happen. I guess you could call it the butterfly effect. I dont think you can really call things like that a "cause".  More like just something that happened, that needed to happen, that led to other things, that in turn leads to other things.But I want to have a experienceMinimumYou said no stimulus is good for your silver calls.I‚Äôll try to understand what he meant... maybe he meant he‚Äôs lucky he bought in the money calls instead of out of the money so his in the money‚Äôs wouldn‚Äôt lose as much value as FD‚Äôs with no stimulus passed? But then he goes and says no stimulus is bullish for silver so I don‚Äôt know.your account is a month oldOh it‚Äôs gonna be green af bro, gonna be lit!Yea lolI couldn't pass up that dip haha. I made an impulse buy for 8/21 $82c. I was up 25% at close alreadyI had bad timing, liquidity issue / lot of money owed, didn‚Äôt get the money until after the turnaround. Still pissed I didn‚Äôt get to sink as much money as I wanted into shares at the bottom.

Oh well.That seemed obvious.  Do you have a strategy or just dicking and picking40$ wtf[deleted]Did u say slv might go to 50? You fuckin autistHow far do you think it‚Äôll dip next week?Yessss, so awesome that it has a name. thank youI try bro, got slaughtered in June because I was balls deep in calls and still have no idea why everything just shit itself like thatSure, you can remix a portfolio over time. But that's reinvesting, not taking profits.You're talking about a general market crash though. One company being overvalued doesn't mean the entire market is bound to crash. 

There's still tons of travel and bank stocks down 30-50%. Once we get a vsccine those stocks will easily carry the market and then some. Wheres the crash?bruh every girls had another dick in there but not everyone‚Äôs had Kanye in there... imagine you‚Äôre Eskimo bro‚Äôs with Kanye WestYes.  Apparently mayonnaise is not considered something green and thus not salad.Wow, I thought I've seen it all here. Thank you.True i know a 37 yo Asian she looks young as fuck and she works for googleMore retarded afterwardsnot even LEAPs?Go to the steroids subreddit if you want hyper machismo dudes, you must live in the tenderloin if you think that's what this is.That‚Äôs the spirit. Also don‚Äôt get tunnel vision on one ticker. There‚Äôs other things to trade. But ur strat is not badCould still be fun though i.e. Mayweather vs NasukawaYou get numb to itI'm down as long as you don't complain when I hit you with that Reverse! Have a good weekend in VA.I was trading it when it was swinging from 8-12, glad to see I didn't miss out by too much.Lol I‚Äôm dear near positive ur a gay boi, I bet they‚Äôll print still we just need a really good day Monday if not that‚Äôs alright I got better positions with AAPL I just bought those cause they‚Äôre dirt cheap and i watched em hit 0.56 they can still run back up if we have a really good day Monday we shall seeYou are trolling or have literally no idea how any of this works lol.lol>The company's net income rose 46% in 2019 to $892.4 million on revenue of $5.1 billion. Quicken Loans extended $145 billion of mortgages last year, and gains on the sale of those loans to money managers represented the bulk of the revenue it generatedIf I‚Äôm not mistaken, GAP is collaborating with Kanye for the next 10 years, and Kohl‚Äôs has some return agreement with amazon already in place. Gives them some staying power in the short term.I'm sorry to hear that man, I really am.  I hope you aren't stuck with that one because of insurance reasons.I said, "I'm having trouble with erectile dysfunction.  Can I have some viagra while I work on improving my diet and exercising?"

Once I found out what it was, I erased that person's existence from my memory to protect myself.Why not? Love an amazing life when you're young enough to appreciate it, then when you're old and can't do anything fun, just keep working to pay off debt? Like that sounds amazing.[deleted]Thanks. I can‚Äôt see It staying stagnant, I‚Äôm guessing it goes one way or the otherYeah I‚Äôm not sure either. I have 6 measly ass shares of amazon and if I could afford more I would buy them. 

No one wants to buy a fractional share of something, I think the demand will be strong for aapl or other tech companies that split their stocksI'm 6 foot dawg but come on man, s5e1 opening with Gene?Don‚Äôt play anymore, but I definitely look back on those days extremely fondlyMSFT 200c 1/2022. And I thought AYX shares **with selling covered calls** were pretty safe for earnings. I've never held a stock that went down 28% in one day before.I ‚ù§ UNeed something to kill me fasterI mean I hope he EOs some stuff (for Bulls sake) but also says for other stuff there needs to be a deal, so other stim keeps hanging out there as an expectation. Schools are fucked without big help, or childcare. No one has any idea what to do.

EDIT:

" I will be doing a news conference on the ChinaVirus, the just announced very good economic numbers, and the improving economy, at 7pm from Bedminster, New Jersey. Also, the subject of the Beirut, Lebanon catastrophe will be discussed. "

Ok nothing on EOs, the fuck is this guy's problem. Is he going to say no stim needed economy is back? That'd be wildYeah man, it‚Äôs getting out of hand.. and people around the country keep voting for these idiots, it‚Äôs ridiculousExactly. That's why trailing stops are important. Once you see that it's above your desired price, set a trailing stop and reduce your chance of getting the minimum price you wantI expect it to go over $20 within days of the merger being completed. $25 EOY is my price target overall, and I‚Äôm planning on holding very long on a bunch of warrant shares that I scooped up cheap this week. Still good value there I think.hahahaha a true autist!I wonder why they bought in July as opposed to waiting until closer to the date, like now?Probably a good choice. Maybe I need to back off of my fear, it just seems so propped up right now that if tech falters or if there is a whiff of a sell off that everything else will fall with it.Alright bro. Report back how it goes. I wish you luck, really because I hate seeing people lose money around here.Buy leaps pal. I‚Äôm in $36 Jan 2022.most 40-50k cars have ~5000 due ~ 
400 mo.  it's not a terrible deal, imo.Isn‚Äôt that with the first months payment, which is $600 without the incentivesMy bad, I was thinking people should go to you for learning options, not that you yourself were learning them.you‚Äôre better off legging into a spread forrealnegate the gamma by buying a call or selling a put for the same expirationFor sure! Obviously an internet stranger isn‚Äôt the most inviting person for music but you might like some of the things with the band. On a side note do you like brand new?I did that with AMZN 2 weeks ago, lost 11k, I‚Äôm still trying to recover lmaoI will be fine. It was a ex dividend date today. So that's healthy pullback for long run.Sorry, Reddit was glitching out and it didn't show that my post went through so I tried to reply to a different comment.Oh fuck. Strategy with these? Short term expectations/exit strategy?

Debated grabbing 200 a couple weeks ago then it ran up again and scared me off.GangGang. 80% of mine is in varying strike of HD and LOW. We got this!Are you thinking about mixing And matching tsla And amazon November cs or just buying as many of 1 as you can?

I played tsla And amzn early April And hit my first 10bagger On them. I actually made a Post about it the Sunday before I entered my positions and got shit on for my Tsla $770cs. But It all depends. Are you trying to make money On playing the premium or do you believe that the underlying asset will actually reach And Stabilize at those price targets? Furthermore, can you hold $80 dollar contracts through rough days?We all do, don't worry you aren't alone üòéWTF?!?!? Keep going king this is the content I live for.Thanks, i made a really stupid play this week after I had an amazing run and tried to yolo it again instead of following my rules.  If/when you get back up to 17k again don't forget to hold those tendies tight and don't go backwards onto old bad habits/patterns.  It seriously happenned quick.  Good luck!GermanyFear of a crash could cause people to pull out. Everyone knows the market is in a massive bubble right now, and we already had the bubble burst once this year. Without a stimulus passed it seems inevitable and soon. That's not to say it IS inevitable and soon, but a lot of people are certainly afraid of that.Fuck guess it‚Äôs time for me to clean my üíªi hear yaThat‚Äôs not what price action means 

Go back to role playingHopefully your LSD trip will help you gain some direction.

I took it and meditated and it kept going to ‚Äòhave a family‚Äô. I followed it and have never been happier. Hope it leads you to a happy direction as well.Then what was stagflation caused by. Yes the gold market will increase to 4k EOYYes there needs to be a crane or America and then the whole world will go bust. We need to allow big businesses to fail and allow for experienced hardship to be economically sound. They need to do extreme monetary policy by real leader and people that care about america not there for there own agenda.Fuck the shit out of that then tell her you your a registered NRA member.He's not hurting me. Neither Biden or Trump means a thing to me. I genuinely might vote for Kanye. 

But if you're a Biden fan I get what you mean. He's definitely going to siphon votes off of Biden in some swing states. But I doubt Biden has a chance anyway unless they manage to get that "we send out ballots to everyone" nonsense passed in a swing state.Maybe a tax could be instituted on stock holdings above 1 bn the same way dividends are. Pays out from the value of the holding but without liquidating the underlying shares. So like the same way after the ex-dividend date the stock price is a bit lower, any person who holds shares collectively worth over 1bn has a small amount levied each year from the total. Idk that‚Äôs just off the top of my head, probably issues with it I don‚Äôt understand.don't back out, never lead with your ass around a guy like thatNo worries. Trust your vibe. But please don't delete this comment like my BRK.B doubters :)Okay thank you! I‚Äôll look them up.They're taking a break after long run.Don‚Äôt be fooled they will go up again this weekWell he has an amazing relationship with my country, gives us so much aid and made me so rich in my home country stock market! What more could I ask for?Well shit.I have no confidence it will happen, but keep in mind if there is a leg down it has to be led by tech, no other sectors have as much space to fall to drop the market2022. Well after my tendies are safe.I'm not worried long term at all, I just want a couple hundred bucks profit to free up my cash so 5% of my portfolio isn't holding this crapI'm not so sure they'll get the full 6 bil from USPS, but even a piece of the contract should be an absolute boon to them.You‚Äôve got it! I‚Äôm not sure about the latter questions; those are a bit more nuanced. I‚Äôd be surprised if a single MM could make that happen, but who knows, there is big money out there somewhere on almost every ticker. On the super low float stocks that‚Äôs definitely more likely.Spreads are sometimes better. You can't moon 1000% but I have till 01/7/2021 for Tqqq to hit 7$ a huge correction will happen eventually. 50$ can turn into 150 ez and if it happens this week I have 11 5$ Calls that turns into 45 each if it hits 6.5$ by 8/14. It's a very good alternative if you want low risk. Just make sure volume for the stock is highSold yet or nah?What do you think is the near-term bottom for gold? Do you think it'll go back up to current levels after the stimulus bill?Yeah I can‚Äôt help you from personal experience because the funds had already been in my account for a while when I applied.  Good luck.Ohhhhhhh. I think it would be mandela effect if we both remembered it wrong.Microsoft is probably good. You need fastly to push 25% just to get to your strike homie, let alone break evenEither way is fine.  Yeah no underwear with the liner.Mid SeptemberAnd I‚Äôd be the one taking you to court for an illegal eviction.And they still don't careMan you‚Äôre just a bundle of emotional problems too aren‚Äôt yah. If you win on your retarded puts in light of a new stimmy this week on the back of some, ‚ÄúCarl Qunitanilla,‚Äù tweets then good for you. I‚Äôll just load up on more calls on the dip and reflect on the fact that your random tweets outdid my Econ major lmaoI don't see how it isn't a good comparison.He confirmed the eyes are a receiver zone for transmission. To protect against it you would need to wear goggles or face shields. He then said he doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs realistic to require or mandate the wearing of goggles, but it would be preventive and went on to talk about face shields as important occupational PPE

Headlines made it look differentYou must be new here... Can we give him some initiation downvotes boys?Your textbook has become irrelevant due to unlimited QE. The government has officially broke the systemYeah but if they don‚Äôt, financial markets and the system tanks which is bad for the US. I‚Äôll give that it‚Äôs a catch 22, but preserving the status quo by govt action is viewed as more beneficial than letting the whole thing crash and burnDude I love RTX! I made some on calls, lost more, and had like 30 shares for awhile. Sold them off to free up money for other stuff, but when i get a chance I‚Äôm gonna buy back in. 

Love defense contractors, killing people is always profitableBut you heard it right?only silver. volatility on gold is not high enough. and i‚Äôd be hedging via ratio spreads.Yeah, I'm the new one.  There's hundreds of stocks with prices way below $.01, and sometimes companies go under and close up.  At that point, your shares are worth 0.  I'm still waiting to see these tickers that magically double though.Okay now I know you‚Äôre shitposting lmaolmaoI mean, I guessNice thanks for sharing.

Right now US is going through a major experiment insofar as it's the first time in history that so many young people have access to and interest in the stock market. 

I'm wondering, what was the moment / reason that actually got you to open a brokerage account? What broker are you using, Robinhood? 

Are your friends also investing? 

This is all fascinating to me. Sorry to intrude.these feelings are more common than you probably think.  the introspection, the existential stuff, the feelings of knowing things other people dont, feeling different and disconnected, harboring lack of empathy, all really normal stuff and part of a mans journey imo.  i am certain you are doing fine.  a man spends his whole life learning. 
 lifting heavy weights every day is the only cheat code, the rest is personalThat‚Äôs all you can do. Ball‚Äôs in her court now. And for sure man, no problem. I think people should be more forgiving of themselves generally ‚Äî good on you for recognizing your mistake, now don‚Äôt dwell.Huh, thanks. I‚Äôll probably visit Portland once this blows over. Would‚Äôve gone this summer but I didn‚Äôt see a point if everything‚Äôs shut down like it is over in ChicagoYeah I know like 99% in SPY call leaps, 1 % Vix call leapsIf it's red, keep it until you are even at least. It might take days, weeks, months...but at least you don't waste money. Don't panic it will be alrightPlease leave this sub.Buy 25 more shares so you can sell a covered call. That way you get some upside while you are in the redStill gonna hold that Intel put thoughI don't get it tho. Whose gonna down vote drinking at 3am? 

I owe u 2 cheers since first response btwAll the better to use Cloudflare :)Things change. They used to be on Cloudflare, now they're on Fastly, next year on Cloudflare again.When do you see 25 year olds in brand new corvettes? Lmao never. If they‚Äôre rich enough to afford a nice car they‚Äôre not gonna buy a corvetteI envy those huge returns, but I would only do it with profits. Too sketchy right now to throw all my profit away.

Next bull market though... I'll be fucking readyLmao forgot about that. His dick must have just been dry coughing every time he cameHoly shit. For me it was sensitive to the touch for a few days after. But I guess that‚Äôs normal after all that friction lolyou got permawood or something dafuqhmm I think you're misunderstanding.Not a problemAlright this actually hurt to laugh at lmao, so worth it though. Needed to hear this ü§£If I could talk to myself when I was at -55% I would beg myself to just be done. Think about how much more money you have right now compared to when you get to -80% or -90%. At the very least I think my most foolproof advice would be to wait a couple weeks and come back. The market will change but your gambling opportunities will still be here and won‚Äôt be any better or worse. You aren‚Äôt missing out on anything quitting now for 2 weeks, I promise. And when you come back with a clear head you might play better or be ready to leave.I really liked death stranding. Got the platinum. Game made me a better person. Keep on keeping on.  

DMC ISNT my type game, but if that‚Äôs something you enjoy I hear it‚Äôs great!It‚Äôs more like... anti-sun 8 months of the year lolShe probably gave him something he hasn‚Äôt seen since.  Changed his perspective. Good for himbut literally all the kerosine evaporates if you know what you're doing and none of it is left in the product[Sure](https://youtu.be/Q5ybPnY1Ehc)I mean instead of spending my time figuring out what this guy talking in cryptic is trying to say Id rather try and get better on my own. But it wouldnt hurt you to guide a little if you are so good.Definitely have a business plan that you can always refer to so that it keeps you on track. There's also many places for freelance work and crowdfunding.I'll check out that sub. The drone should be epic, I was watching some videos of them awhile ago and I'm thinking of getting the dji phantom drone. 

I've been around WA, Bainbridge Island, Lake Crescent, La Push and Cape Flattery. I love the drive by Lake Crescent.Sounds like you have a decent plan. What kind of products are you investing in? You'll be able to qualify for JPM PB once you reach that goal haha. They have some good perks(my parents have it). 

I have a few brokerage accounts, I tend to look at it as some are a serious portfolio and the other is to bullshit around with here.  I have to say, I genuinely hope people make a lot here regardless of which side they're holding.Or should I just half my position size and not look at the app until the expiry ? The FOMO after it hits SL and goes favourable has giving me hard time since last few weeks.I mean I have picked some awesome weeklies too and paperhanded then away before they actually went into big profit. Like for some day I feel like if I should have just slept the whole day I would be in much better position. Can't figure out a way to cure this issueI love youMan, I'm so ready to move out of the burbs. Lowkey hoping I make a ton of money if silver gets around 2011 level so I can buy some land.Yea I doubt the YOLO factor of it will change. Ppl will still end up looking up ‚Äústocks rising‚Äù or ‚Äúpopular stocks‚Äù and find shit like RKT. Interesting tho that they are trying to abandon the YOLO factorI should have waited till end of days. Fomo into calls midday is the mistake I need to avoid in the future..You knew none of them. Why are you inserting this bullshut it talking point into the conversation?I totally agree. Big business runs this country and has for a long time. Politics are a damn sham now because there is no incentive for anyone to work together and pass bipartisan legislation.That‚Äôs pretty good bragging rights too üßêü§îWe will se sir.

I love hibiki. I‚Äôm happy your experiencing it. It‚Äôs not that.

Just stop buying puts and you‚Äôll be iight.I appreciate your insight. He was talking about how big firms sort of conspired to keep it low due to legacy short positions they had after Bear Sterns. I just looked at the chart and what you‚Äôre saying makes a lot of sense. I guess it‚Äôs easy to say, in retrospect, ‚Äúsilver ran up so much in 2009!‚Äù and gloss over the actual timeline; you don‚Äôt really think about the time it took and the ups and downs it had along the way. I‚Äôm now considering getting out of the trade if it doesn‚Äôt go my way by mid next week. Out of curiosity, do you have any recommendations on good plays? You seem to know your shit!I appreciate that. I definitely have a good trade ideas and do thorough research but I think I need to work on discipline when it comes to risk analysis. Do you have any good tips or rules of thumb that you use? I had four green days where I was up $1000 each day and I just got greedy and now I‚Äôm down 500 overall. It sucks.Yeah, I too am scared of the peasants climbing out of poverty. They give my retarded uncle a whopping $800 a month to live on. They should just drop people like him off in the woods. There, I solved the poor people welfare problem. Now to address the corporate and rich people welfare that both parties love to not talk about.Lol yeah fuck it. Worked out anyways, someone offered to rent our apartment in September and October so  are moving to Nantucket for those months and probably wouldn‚Äôt have if we did Paris. Enjoy your trip!But requiring an artist admit they're selfish is just moronic. Again, of course I am. No one creates without the intention of sharing it with the world. I didn't think I needed to admit I was selfish, just like I don't need to admit I have skin or blood. Just like you don't have to admit you are being selfish for commenting in these threads or being combative with me. We're all seeking validation--constantly. Or trying to get our jollies by poking at others. We're all selfish.

And to your question, I wouldn't mind at all. So I guess that's the end of it. You don't want it to happen at all, and I wouldn't care if everyone did it. (Also, have you been in any of these threads? Almost everyone *does* repost their DD, emoji spam, and BRRRRRRRRRRRR over and over. At least my repost took effort and there was 10 hours between it, not minutes.)They dropped out because their numbers didn't add up. They had no path forward at that point. None of them won a clear victory in IA or NH. Biden blew out SC and polling showed he was gonna blowout the whole South. It had nothing to do with pReSerVinG sTaTuS qUo. Their campaigns were toast.Is this a come on? Cuz I‚Äôm a bull. Maybe you got confused.At it's current price? I guess none of it really matters... It just matters what is popular.Yea I think so, mainly just so I don't miss any large trends up or down and miss out on some extra profits. If it's a sudden 10%day there's nothing to be done there, it happens, but it's too hard to pick a strike price for a month out"Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence... the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government." --George WashingtonYeah I been burned on weeklies before, sucks man50 miles is 80.47 kmit is.......... just explained it...... might be a reading problemIf I‚Äôm gonna cheat I‚Äôm doing the good stuff.Had a put go ITM right before that and got greedy trying to make up for last night. Didn't work out.Buy a few calls that's all I can offerP/E ratios do matter because people will panic when they are holding grossly overvalued stocks and there is a downturn.Unbelievable. And I thought it was healthy because soybean oil is a vegetable.

*Note to self:* try using bacon fat instead.It‚Äôs shares not options it‚Äôll happen soon but not by the end of the yearOnly if you diamond hands them. Like imagine if you bought call leaps in Feb. If you sold them during the March crash then there's no use of leaps. 

Options trading takes a lot of time, mental, and emotional toll. People buy stocks so they don't have to worry about daily fluctuations. After seeing my account go up and down tens of thousands of dollars in minutes, I just sold all my options and switched to stocks a couple weeks ago. Haven't checked my Robinhood since then. If you can have the same behavior while holding leaps and check only once a month, sure they're worth it.Your response also seemed a little too melodramatic to be believable ‚Äúgoing to my designated scream room and cry‚Äù, hence why I thought you were being somewhat sarcasticTbh I like to focus on 1-4 tickers at a time. I have long term investments obviously as well, but for options I don‚Äôt like to go overboard. Usually play ~3 tickers and hold for a few weeks at a time excluding LEAPs, FD‚Äôs, or CC‚Äôs. Anything more I‚Äôm just staring at my phone all day.Oh yeah its a fun bet around earnings but it always seems to reset to.at least.$15. Look it up in Nov thats next earnings.Good luck man. If it gaps up like that it benefits both of us.What u think AMD will do Monday?See the Kanye Adidas collab feels natural. The Kanye Gap collab just feels desperate on both sides. I think it‚Äôll fall through or bust. It‚Äôs not a good match. Kanye‚Äôs audience and Gap‚Äôs audience don‚Äôt overlap at all.If they charge me for a virtual appointment I better get a damn prescription lolEventually, you get old enough you don't get embarrassed talking to your doc.  She's not going to fuck me, what do I care if she knows my pecker doesn't always rise to the occasion?  She's already seen how small and sad it is during physicals.I‚Äôm very comfortable with my sexuality, but I‚Äôd feel hella gay if a girl put her fingers in there, that‚Äôs what I do when I fuck girls üòïCurious, what strategies do you employ to expect that kind of return?jesus christ, atleast it‚Äôs stock and not options so you have time3/19 SPY 220pHe‚Äôs really gonna come out and brag about the stock market closing green today üòÇüòÇüòÇGot it bro. Question. If trailing stop is at $$ price then I get it that it would be triggered if it hits the level. People talk about a % training stop. How does that work. For example I sold Apple at 322. If I used a trailing stop with $322 price, I understand that it would be triggered if price came to that level. Alternatively how do we use a % trailing stop in that situation. How does that work? Which one do you use. Thank youglad to hear that, i've been in since the beginning (only shares) and been thoroughly disappointed so far. guess i might hold until EOY now...they could've thought it would continue to climb, they could've wanted to. avoid any IV over a rally up for the news.Yeah literally nobody knows, I'd rather just trade the trend for now. I've been fucked too hard in the past by going against it.Going to try $100 a day until i lose $1k max. I'm ok with that lossInteresting, ill look into that. Thanks!Fuck I may do it 

If I can make the downpayment this month off trading I‚Äôll do it.Ok I'm in.That's what I was thinking. Hard to do maths after a few. ü§°yep, im devil and god are raging inside me gangOuch. Amazon is too volatile for me.Is buying calls a day before ex-div date a bad idea generally?Upvote for satisfactory explanationI bought them in that dip a few days back. Yesterday it did good. Hope that to continue and volatility bucks to increase next week. Might hold a few through HD earnings.I'm just tryna hit a 10 bagger bro I wana turn my 20k to 100 atleastYeah tomorrow when it‚Äôs almost 100 degrees, you gonna be ‚Äúwhat the fuck‚Äù?
Or wait, you have AC in your house?And what would cause the crash? If you fucking read what I said tech is holding up the market. Consumer spending is at an all time high. E-commerce is at an all time high. With corona lockdowns looming this fall it means nothing but more money for big tech. There was no bubble in March, people were scared of uncertainty of corona lockdowns. The Fed itself said it will not let the market go down, it will literally buy individual stocks if it has too. Keep burning your money on puts. There may be a couple red days, but there won‚Äôt be weeks of circuit breakers down like in March.https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-action.aspGod you sound like a dickHaha. Having a hard time finding this funny thoughLol you sure sound like a happy fulfilled person who is totally not a fat incelThanks again for the adviceNo, I have a feeling the the dollar has one more rally in it, looking for /GC to get to 1950, wipe out late buyers and reverse higherFor the near term, if we are talking gold futures, I am looking for anywhere between 1900-1950. After the stimulus passes it will rally. But, Gold is not going up because of government spending, it is catching it's real bid because of Fed intervention. Along with global intervention from their respective monetary authorities. As long as they continue to print, gold will rise, because the "Global Reserve Currency" is getting pressured against all other currency pairs.Thank ya. I've traded plenty in this account, like 3.5k commissions since March, first time re-depositing. Hope it works out, I need my futures fix! Have a nice weekend homieWho dis? üí•The surge look the coolest but they have that weird ass pocket with no regular side pockets. That's a deal breaker for me unfortunately.Why do you say that?You got the money for court you have the money to pay your bills.Who said I am not net long?  And I am sorry reading is hard for you.  The data from your fellow majors is in there.  Congrats on your econ degree.  I am sure your parents are proud.  Sorry your profession has been replaced by a lawyer with a computer that digitally creates numbers.  Maybe it will become relavant soon, which I honestly hope.  Peace out.  Pizza time.I'm not new bitchTrue. I guess they figure they'll just let the future generation deal with the consequences of all of this later.Silver is earlier on in its bull run than gold fren. Gold has been going since like July sometime.what ratio?Lol you probably started 2 weeks ago.  I have been trading for 9.5 months bud.ü§´ü§´ü§´where u at all time down that 22k or u make it back?Oh, yea sure it‚Äôs all good. I started trading in June solely because it‚Äôs what a lot of my friends were discussing and I wanted to contribute to the conversation so I did some research and started to really enjoy learning about the stock market. From what I assume is that you‚Äôre an older fellow so I would be fascinated too to see this surge of investors. I started with Robinhood, and am still on it, despite all the bad remarks I‚Äôve heard about it. Looking to possibly switch to TDA in the future. Also, I figured this is a good time to experiment with the market due to the unique circumstances. 2k isn‚Äôt that much in my savings so as long as I learn something in this process and am able to apply it further down my life in investing I will be happy. If I make some good money in the process, that‚Äôs even better. Sorry for the long response but I‚Äôm glad your interested.Portland is cool, i love nature and there's a ton of amazing places just outside there that are really nice to get lost in.My man!If it doesn‚Äôt improve before or after earnings I‚Äôll be shitting bricksCheck pleaseI'm on the west coast its 1230Would you rather have fast service to North America or Asia?They were never on cloudflareCorrect, every zoomer wants a TeslaLol when he bust it‚Äôs the scene in the movie white chicks with the dry breast milk"dry coughing" dedYeah now I lube up haha, live and learn! Couldn‚Äôt imagine doing it that much at 32 now thoughNah I understand. It‚Äôs meaningless. Markets just go up because someone is willing to pay more, hence the greater fool theory. Looking at historical data, Switzerland apparently holds the record at 397%. We can beat them.Sorry about that buddy, you be safe I hope that surgery goes fantastic and you‚Äôre out there making money on Monday, we gonna go to the Emerald city it‚Äôs gonna be so greenI hated it. Felt like I was working as a Postman in the mountains, without getting paidVitamin D, our lord and savior.I mean they did still sleep in the same bed...[deleted][deleted]Yeah, appreciate the tip. I'll definitely look into those.I got the DJI mavic air. It's an absolutely phenomenal little thing. The phantom must be even better.

Unfortunately my time in WA hasn't been long enough. I'm from CA so I don't get up there except for once a year usually. 

However, I have been by Lake Crescent. I stayed in an airbnb for a night in the town of Sequim. Saw a bit of the rain forests and northwestern coast. I'd love to make it back up there with more time to spend the next time.I'm really just invested in stocks and a smaller amount of LEAPs. Right now, I think the market is on the edge of falling, but I also have enough long term wisdom to know it's never truly a good time to sell. So I sell covered calls as a bit of insurance and IV is pretty elevated anyway to make for a good rate of return. I lever up when things seem down, lever all the way down as I am now when things seem hot.I love you bothThat‚Äôd be awesome bro, I hope it works out for you! I dream of bugging out to Maine, next to a fresh water source and watching the world go up in smoke in 20 years. Just because I shit talk bears doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be right in the long runYep I‚Äôve made the same mistake myself, makes it a lot less stressful when you don‚Äôt have to watch them lose value for 2 hours and just assume it isn‚Äôt going to moon out of nowhere on a red dayI grew up around my grandparents that escaped from concentration camps. Why are you so upset?Oh for sure but if you‚Äôre already PDT restricted no point in not switching to TD/thinkorswimNot every creditor will agree to that.Hell yeah brother! He probably also hasn‚Äôt lost as much money as us on stonks lolIndeed, considering that I'm not the one fearmongering here.Lol....I only had Jack Daniels once. I usually drink Glenfiddich, Glenmorangie, and a few others. I collect. Also the original post was "what are you drinking?"I mainly scalp futures, gold and SP500 so don't have any recommendation on stocks. I do plan on buying long dated calls on SLV and GLD if silver and gold drop down to a certain range. 

Had a look at ELY. It dropped to a decent support at around 18.15. I do see that it already bounced off it and hit it a second time. Hopefully it gets back to at least 19.50. There's a strong resistance at 20.40 which is most likely why it dropped. Don't know if there was news today but if there was, they timed it well.Well that‚Äôs a different story. I don‚Äôt even know where to begin in talking about that oneI agree, we post to be read or to vent. What rubbed me the wrong way was that "perhaps selfish" bit. Good on you for taking full ownership, tuning the aggressiveness down and overall keeping the convo level-headed <3

Yeah, I've seen those threads, unfortunately. The circumstances are turning this sub into a Robinhood meme theme park. I love the leeway given by our üåà mods but sometimes it's just low effort content or karma farming. Like there was a guy posting in every thread: "Upvote if retarded". Shit's funny the first two times, three tops.

Your post was great by the way. The sub would be in a much better place if we had more of those and less emoji cancer. I guess you changed my mind. Thank you!

I took you repost as another karma farming attempt, and I realize I was wrong, at least that doesn't seem to be your primary intent.

PS: Donnie Pump üëë Monday goes brrrrrYou are free to believe what you wish.At its current price. They are genuinely growing very fast, growth is coming in a space with real potential for expansion (cloud), unlike AAPL selling phones. CEO has real vision and proven ability to generate profit (unlike AMZN).We were talking about "Romanians", right?  I can't remember at this point.  The upside is, you've already written the first talking point for the democrats when Biden loses:  "We didn't really lose.  It was those damn Romanians."How many Bridget the midgets is that?got it. thanksI love you and really hope it doesStay around 85Not sure I‚Äôd agree with that. Balmain and Versace did collaborations with H&M and the clothes sold out instantly and were reselling for the cost of the real stuff. People go crazy for collabs. The supreme x Louis Vuitton was crazy even though it was some of the most generic looking stuff I‚Äôve ever seen.You talking a doc, or the forhims thing?  Forhims will give you a script because that's literally their whole thing.  Just answer the questions in the obviously correct ways.Everyone got their thing bro, no worries either way, but i thought the same thing then yowza! LolFocusing on simple things. Like I am limiting myself to companies that I believe have potential upside with an upcoming catalyst. Trying not to take unnecessary risks (like holding through ER etc.). I am just buying calls and trying to sell for a profit when it seems like it has run it's course. Just one step at a time.It's all good. You zoom out. You can't make money in the market every day even with perfect strategies.I use RH but it really is a shitty broker. With something like IBKR or Fidelity, you can set trailing stops that are dynamic, so you can trigger when the value of the option falls by a certain percent value. 

Robinhood only lets you set a static price and that really isn't a "trailing stop". A trailing stop really should automatically update as the value of the option increases, but RH stop prices need to be manually cancelled and reset all the time. 

You can imagine how much of a hassle this is. That's why the big boys use better brokers.Yeah, I was starting to get impatient too... but think about the fact that it‚Äôs still pre merger. Big investors are holding off until the merger is official. Once it is, it‚Äôs gonna bounce up big time. I just hope it happens before mid September for the sake of my calls. But either way, I‚Äôm holding my shares long term. They‚Äôre ready to scale up and expand their customer base big time, and with more and more states legalizing online sports betting and gambling, there‚Äôs lots of upside.But they money they put in would tend to suggest knowledge of some event coming up, its like 5Mil or moremake sure to shop around.  high end dealerships are getting killed rn, you'll prolly be able to negotiate atleast 20% off the deal at low volume rural dealership.

i signed a $350 a mo lease w Acura for $250 last month,üëç now practice and learnDankü§òcool. You‚Äôll like the shittty bands I have recommended, they‚Äôre not good but you‚Äôll get thereYeah. I‚Äôm not touching AMZN for a while. Literally lost so much of my gains I cried lol. How many contracts did you have of BRK.B to get 9k for ITM contracts? If it moved the other way, you would have lost a lot of moneyYeah stocks usually dips on ex dividend dates.Samesie. Think jumped in last week. I'll hold half of each through ER.I‚Äôd divide it up. Pick 1 or the other And then go spread out the rest of the money On further out FAANG components. You can never force a company to go On a hot streak, but when a company does you better make sure you have money to take the opportunity.I don‚Äôt have an AC but I don‚Äôt really care to be honest. Just open the windows in the morning and let in some cool air, will last the whole day if you keep the sun out. Forecast for tomorrow looks like 35C (95F) so not that bad. The only time it was really bad was when we hit about 42C (about 107F) last year for a day or two. The constant AC and the resulting temperature changes when leaving/entering a building in the US were more annoying imo.Read the last sentence of the first paragraph r-tard


Then read the rest so you can actually improveWow rude. üôÖNow you gotta go just to find out.Agreed. Could easily see a major dollar spike but it might cause a correction in equities at the same time.Yeah the new model sucks.  Check out RhoneMy little sister has a better insult game than you no lieYeah boomers been fucking us since before we were born, might as well continue after they die I guess smhthinking 3x5, but i haven‚Äôt done my options crafting analysis yetLol!  Alrighty.  So is this just a RH dumbass thing, or do you actually think stonks never go below $.01?Never made it back :(  
Summer 2019 I made 14K from retardedly and repeatedly shorting Aphria. lost the full 14K trying to continue shorting throughout october 2019, put in another 8K over the course of the following months and traded/lost that.  
My new strategy is every paycheck I'm just going to buy SPY on the dips. accumulate a couple thousand dollars worth of shares, then sell on the up days and rinse/repeatI think you've got a great perspective on this. Enjoy the journey, I wish you great luck and fortune in investing and life my friend.

P.s. surviving is the most important long term wealth builder. Folks that blow up their accounts with risky bets lose out on the inevitable upward trajectory of the market.So there's even less reason to down vote you...

Instructions unclearTbh knowing this community that sounds very understandableYa, let me know if you want a different perspective/approach.Selling covered calls are good to do. Also consider exercising contracts if they ever go deep ITM(think AAPL in the last week). Two of my favorite stocks I've been holding since 09, BAC and AIG. All I do is buy more when they go low and have all divys reinvested. 

What's your reason for the market to fall?I think we're in for a tough decade.

Funny you mention maine. I live in ca and a buddy of mine moved out to maine a couple years back. I went an visited him in July. Started looking at homes out there for the hell of it. 

Housing is ridiculously cheap. And he said work is easy to find because most people only work part time because the cost of living is so low. 

I was looking at a 3 bed 1 bath with a full basement and fully built 18x24 garage, on 8 acres, on the ocean, and it was 200k.

Winters are tough out there, but if you live by the ocean like he does, the snow doesn't usually get above a foot, and melts quickly because of all the moisture. 

And the humidity isnt that bad. Only had one humid day in the week I was out there.Have you tried?

Story is interesting but the gameplay wasn't my thingWill do, would you happen to know of any other means of compiling spreadsheets or am I better off sticking to Excel?I think that business and economic cycles play out more slowly than the market realizes, and the covid economic fallout is still playing out. Business performance has been outright impressive for the environment, especially tech. But I expect it's going to take a longer amount of time for the consequences to kick in, and businesses to contract spending and investment. So the rapid recovery in business performance that's happening will be followed with a longer gradual decline.Yeah been scouting it out.

It's not exactly a tightly-controlled drug.Currently in TGT and WORK for run up to their upcoming ER. I also have some UBER calls expiring Jan 15, 2021.

I keep a little bit of cash on hand to buy a weekly call or two if it looks good, for instance I bought TSLA $1475 and AMD $90 calls expiring next week. I should be able to exit out of that Monday/Tuesday morning.That makes sense. But I'm good, I'm dialed into long term plays, with nothing shorter than LEAPs.Sure you canDon't buy calls when stock is green. It's just gamble.ThanksTickers?

I forgot that when major companies need to cache and serve their websites onto the world, the first thing they think to ask is it as fast as my monitor...Oh man. Good thing we didn‚Äôt then. Plus I‚Äôd think we‚Äôd be way more desensitized to porn at our age if we had all that availability.The stock market is definitely a discount mechanism. Google search "Stock market discount mechanism" lol.Excel is good, you can just write some code and have everything simplified.I agree with those points. You can only hide a bit under the rug before it becomes obvious that something is wrong. 

There's also speculation that the number of people infected in the US can be up to 10x the amount of people reported. Some people really lack common sense.What about that region specifically makes it better for an apocalypse type event?Damn bro what kind of debt was thisF. Maybe you‚Äôre right.Lol first 3 companies aren‚Äôt that great long term holds tnh. TSLA is meh. AMD is okHahaha props for sticking with it bro.  Honestly I'm just trying to post outlandish bullshit and look at the wide range of responses.  Did you see how many idiots think this is real!?!!I lol‚ÄôdGlad we agree finallyIt‚Äôs supposed to be one, but the market has been detached from fundamental discount rates since 2017.

I got a degree in finance bro. CFA L2 candidate.Ok, cool. Appreciate it!Awhile back looked at some maps with projected heat temps in 2050 and the northeast, central US appeared to have less temperature rise than other parts of the US. 

Sea level rise is another issue, while of course Maine would lose land, it‚Äôll lose less than say Florida, or the gulf coast states.

Proximity to fresh water is a big deal, and of course like you said, land is pretty cheap out there. Of course, nothing is perfect but it‚Äôs certainly better than Houston, where I‚Äôm trying not to die at our current temps. 

Not sure I even want to continue living if shit just totally hits the fan, but I‚Äôd like to have options.TGT and WORK both should run up enough to give me a cash boast in next two week or so. That's all I need from them. As for UBER, it's more of a recovery play which I believe should happen between now and election time.

TSLA and AMD are the companies I truly believe have massive growth potential. I would buy long dated calls on both of them if I had more cash to spare. So for now, when I see a short term opportunity, I buy some calls and try to profit from them.Man, I was just hoping to educate some of those peeps.  Because I literally tried this with options when I was new.  Lol!üòÑüòÖüòòI alternate between education and shitposting comedy.  But the shitposting is way more fun.

You‚Äôre down to one pro and a shitload of cons. Move along.Wsb should start it's own brokerage with blackjack and hookers!Fucking lame. I make so much money from this data.Was bad for their image and now they can sell it :/This is mega sad. I have been developing python files that compile my account %s and gives me custom info that I need based on the options i wanna buy.  Mega gay their selling out what fags still the best platform tho since it looks like a video game while the rest look like a 2013 e-commerce site"Stop making fun of me! NOOO, stop! **FINE, I'M TAKING MY BALL AND GOING HOME!**" - RH basicallyMassive faggotsfuckSo that site tracking stats will be down soon.So Robinhood is restricting backdoor access now? I thought gay-conversion therapy didn't work?This is such a bummer. I was just starting to work with their API too.TD Ameritrade (thinkorswim) has 0% commissions and free options trading for all US stocks. Basically can do everything you can do with robinhood. Found that out and wondered why anyone would still choose robinhood

/for anyone that doesn't knowYou dumb fucks don‚Äôt get why. They are guilty as hell!  Large funds opened endless Robinhood accounts and use them to manipulate share prices with 1000s or single share purchases. Just buy options and then turn on your RobinHood mass login and buy app and drive up the share price with a bunch of dummy accounts making stupid tiny over priced purchases. Paper gains!god damn fags broI didn't even know this was possible. I truly belong in this subFirst hit was free.FCan get burned.What are you going to use instead?Who did they sell out too?Why would they need to do this unless they're losing customers? They numbers must be starting to look bad.They should make wsb yolos private as well.I dont really expect them to be able to fix this issue any faster than the infinite money glitchIt baffles me why anyone still uses Robin hood now that real brokers are free too. There is no upside except the nice UI. I use RH to follow prices then buy on SchwabNow where do I find where to buy all my puts.They will just sell that info to pros for tons of money. Thats their business model already.This is good for the little guy. The RHT owner has said he has had hard times pulling the data due to API volume. The big guys have been using this data to fuck you but youre not autistic enough to see it. It's the same as fading the public in sports betting but when they fade they are jacking up premiums and selling calls to you at the top.Is this the top?Use robintrack.com, you‚Äôre welcome***GOOD!!!***Rob from the poor and give to the rich. They did it backwards.That‚Äôs because you missed the Inc part of the nameyep lol

Edit: looking at you, Citadel...you fuckersFuck the only useful information on this board......ffffsssssst and it's gone like a fart in the wind.[deleted]There‚Äôs the name of your brokerage ‚Äúautismo‚Äù 

Could be cool if the right people within WSB came together to make an app that looks and feels as close to legit casino games as possible though Robinhood has done pretty good on that front tooYou must be young. Nothing is designed for the Public good. It's all a means to and end-- your money. They'll fight the good fight for a few years and once they have a base proceed to be the biggest twats everThink about this this. The US market is the only one with PDT rules.Indeed. They are 100% selling this shit to hedge funds and smart money. Scum just like every other broker IMO, only difference is their platform and infrastructure is garbageAnyone holding htz is a retard.Let's all pool our money and see how much Robinhood would charge for the data. Hopefully, it's under $69The main thing that they achieved was in getting enough traction with 0 commissions to force the big boys (Fidelity/Schwab/TD/etc) to eliminate the majority of their shit fees.

Now there is literally no reason to use RH over thinkorswim (TD), tastyworks, active trader pro (Fidelity), or any of the mobile apps they have.

Smaller bid/ask spreads in general, more advanced options, etc.What other app can we use?r/retard_bot Basically powered by autism, adderall , and mountain dew. I've been coding this shit for many months now, the analysis done behind the scenes is extremely thorough. We'll soon have our own retarded form of big data driven options analysis (and this retard aint selling out). Check out the sub for some more infoHopefully we can at least still pay for it somewhere if it helps that much.
Edit: still gay AFI'm sure someone can inject a virus to steal all the data back when they inevitably screw up next leap yearIf you want a broker with an API TD Ameritrade has a pretty good API that gives you account positions and all the other stuff.I feel that bro, was trying to develop a fun leaderboard robinhood site for my friends but without the API can't really track accounts :/Same, literally started a project last week with the apiWell they might still leave some access open. Time will tell what's still accessible.And they have an API too (although not like RH did where you can see the holdings by other users.)

Also TDA charges 65¬¢ per contract leg, but you‚Äôll probably make that back with better execution/interface.Free options? Thought they had a fee on optionsToS has a lot of UI issues honestly. You can do a lot more but it also takes longer to do the simple things you can do in a second on RH. Also no 2FA on ToS as far as I can tell even though my TDA has it. I use ToS for graphs and RH for the actual trade.It says .65 per contract.  Am I looking at $65 a trade?I'm new searching for the best FD I can find...  .65 per contract is too much. I can't afford that when I'm dropping 30 on SPY Puts.Had to scroll real far to find the plausible explanation.Or someone is buying the data off themThe point of the post was that site is going awayLol not only are you retarded but you got the site wrong as well. You're perfect for this sub üôÇYou can buy that domain for $69,420why would that be good?I always thought the game was a little on the nose, you know since it's robbing retards and giving it to the richRobbing Da Hoodjw, if I made a chrome extension that connected to your robinhood buys & sells, would people use that?

We only need a hundred or so smooth brains to form a statistically significant indicatorIsn't that Mercer or Theil's company?The hedge funds who have been making bank fading autists.Huh I don't know, maybe a hedge fund or an option market maker?You can do 4-wheel or 3-wheel slot machines that tell you what to go forKinda like the site we‚Äôre using right nowRemind me again why anybody bothers using RH when there are several better brokers out there that don't crash their servers every other month and actually have good fill times?Hopefully the data becomes useless which i think it will. If the data being shown is manipulated autistically as i think it is by WSB and the lemmings(nature's retard) then the data will probably not be the same post autism removal. So hopefully it bites them in the back with loss of trades/users and the data becoming less valuable since moron sheep say "stonk no have people stonk bad." So now sheep will have blinders on and run in the most retarded direction available.with r/retard_bot we will become the smart money. we then create our own wsb hedge fund and teach the world salvation through autism.TastyWorksTastyworks is really good and very simple. 

Thinkorswim is alot more advanced with tons of tools if youre really into it.I enjoy using webull but others have had problems with them.

The old-school brokers with better customer support seem to all have terrible mobile apps.Is it open source?Someone with money unlike me fund this man0% fuckin chance. It's gonna be sold for big moneyWhen robinhood buying goes parabolic, sell, sell, sell. It is a confirmation for my exit strategy. Helps a lot for mid, small, and micro cap plays.No chance, if they charge $5 for it, it‚Äôs gonna get leakedYup the api is great bro but I‚Äôm not putting money in think or swim that‚Äôs for our grandpas. I‚Äôve had 10k in stock in my TD for the longest time and it‚Äôs worst than robinhood all around I don‚Äôt care.Narrator: *Nothing was still accessible. As Robinhood decided its name was just a name and cut all ties from a wealth redistribution persona to one more about consolidating it.*Which API?$0.65

TD Ameritrade is vastly superior to RH. Takes a little time to adjust to think or swim from how streamlined and simple RH app, but once you do you realize it's way betterI'm inclined to agree... But then when I think about how I'd do the UI differently I have no idea lol. I'll def be doing the same with RH/ToS for awhile. Gotta get around to moving the goods fr but I dont want to sell lolNo it's $0.65 per trade/contract.I used to pay 6.95 per leg. Thank God that that racket ended. But they realized they could make it up by front running order flow and fading autistic users.Could always use robinhood for options. I hear ya tho. it isn't exactly free, but man its just so much better. Another way to look at it is to add 0.0065 to each contract premiumPorque no los dosOh wow I‚Äôm clearly autistic I didn‚Äôt bother reading the entire post ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èWhy is it anybody's business in the first place?  I only see it as a easy way for MM's to completely fuck over Robinhood investors.You mean the app that shows confetti every time I deposit money doesn‚Äôt have my best financial interests at heart?I was referring specifically to citadel securities. They're the biggest options market maker in the US https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_LLCKen griffin. He was recently fined $700k for front running his clients.

As you can see, the law is really "tough" . He definitely isn't up to anything shady because he wouldn't risk another "HUGE" fine now would he?

There's no way he made more than $700k with such info


/s[deleted]Yep like a random stock ticker generatorI love all of these ideas I‚Äôm seeing: ticker slot wheel, strike price wheel, leader boards... how do we make this a reality?Pretty much.What brokers do you prefer? I'm new!A 2.2 rating on the play store doesn't exactly inspire confidenceFun fact: TastyWorks was made by the same gent that created ToS before it sold to TDA. 

That's why it's basically a lightweight clone of the same functionality. 

This has been a StonkFact. Thanks for tuning in.ToS doesnt have 2FA as far as I can tell. TDA does but apparently not ToS which is crazyI don‚Äôt mind the Schwab app. But I agree it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúsexy‚Äù like Robinhood, but in some respects, it‚Äôs probably better you know what you are doing with options.If you open source a trading algo, it becomes worthless. As in big money comes in and buys up all the volume instantly making the trades expensive and inefficient. The best I can do is publish the positions live on WSB. I'll have a bot creating a thread every week where it comments plays in real-time.That's so fucking lameWhy is this? When Robinhood users go up alot of people start selling?As soon as I started seeing slv here I knew it was time to exit.  Which it was.If they charge $5 for it, I'll pay for it.Lmao, I wish my grandpa could know how to use TOS. I'd be really impressed.[This API](https://developer.tdameritrade.com/apis)ThanksSo $1.30 total if you buy and sell?If they weren't selling data before, I bet they are now somehowHoly shit you're retarded, welcome to the club.Happens. I only commented because I care üòÇ. Aka I will be sad to lose that site and I‚Äôm sure you will be too

And I think you mean retarded. Autistic is a good thing, ya know, like you obsess over patterns and numbers and it makes you good at this shit

WSB people stay confusing autistic and retarded lately, you must be newWell previously everybody had access to that info and now only the MM's, hedge funds do

Better if everybody has that info rather than just large institutionsOf course they do. Don‚Äôt you want to celebrate and feel good? Deposit moreThey don't need to buy their data since they probably get so much order flow from them and other brokerages anyways this data is a drop in the bucket.Thanks! I'll read upyoure right. MMs making millions have no idea what they are doingYou are right. It's probably more that too many people have access to the data they have been using for years and are fucking up their tendies.Autismo would have public leaderboards. For winners and losers.Literally any and all other broker.  I use TD personally.  I have no clue why anyone uses.Robinhood
 it is shit and aids blended together and shoved up your butthole.TD Ameritrade for stocks and options

Alpaca if you want to write an algorithm and let the computer do all the trading

Interactive brokers if you want to trade on margin

I use TD Ameritrade and am a fanSame! I thought appeal of RH was lack of feesTastworks is what I use but the mobile app sucks or TD is also great, I made the move last month and haven't  looked back.Thats a rating on the app not the brokerage. App is functional but doesn't have a reset account balance or undo button like the Robinhood app.

The brokerage has low fees and phone support. They also have IRA accounts so you can yolo some tax sheltered money.SubscribeI use Schwab for my banking and like them. Once they add fractional shares beyond the S&P 500 I might move my Roth IRA over from Fidelity.Its all about monitoring the pump and exiting as the pump peaks. Monitoring RH accumulation is a nice surrogate for overall "FOMO". It isn't RH specifically, but rather since RH represents a large population of traders, once all traders start buying into FOMO it is time to sell into the pump. TD, Schwab, Fidelity, Webul and others, all follow a similar trajectory, its just that RH gives this data away for free and in a format that is easy to access; which is why I rely on this source to much.Big RIP for the guy who thinks the volume of people from WSB would ever stop the rise of SLV.!remindme 30 daysIt‚Äôs easier to risk more quicker with robinhood and get into lvl 3 options the fastest that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs the bestYes, per option contract.True it's a small piece of data but order flow is different than holdings data. This is still very valuable, and cheap, for a MM like Citadel.Etrade here, just as solid. Only real fees are $0.50 on options and like $4.95 for OTCHoly shit there‚Äôs a reset button on Robinhood?Thanks for subscribing to StonkFacts!

Did you know that a stonk is the same as a stock, except that a stonk is owned by a retard while a stock is owned by a regular person? Stonks only go up, because retards will buy anything, but a *stock* can in fact go *down*. 

**AMAZING!!**If it is a Roth IRA, why do you need fractionals?Well someone else spent big bucks to take your tendies from youAhhh yeah I see. Well fuck man when this is gone I hope theres another way to measure that shit, or something similar.I will be messaging you in 30 days on [**2020-09-07 07:12:47 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2020-09-07%2007:12:47%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i5pz7u/rip_robintrack_robinhood_restricting_access_to/g0rojxe/?context=3)

I‚Äôm in.LET THE PUMP BEGIN MONDAY!!their plan looks incredible, anyone watch the jay Leno episode? love that they gave a tour of everythingfuck it, more HCACPartnership with NVDA. EV skateboard technology JV with Hyundai. I think their skateboard could be used for the Fisker ocean as well given both companies are based in LA and Fisker just hired their former President. I also think this company is best set up to disrupt the taxi industry. They plan on going from city to city with their subscription model. With level 5 autonomy, this company would be an absolute game changer.What's the stock ticker symbol?Sold me! I'm in! They inked a 2.8 billion deal already with their "skateboard" platform.Thanks for the math, pretty complex stuff that tripling 11 is 30.In for 2k sharesSon of a bitch! I'm in for a few thousand warrantsFuck it I‚Äôm inIn for 1100 shares and 250 warrants of HCACbefore anyone scoffs at any of this: do some DD of your own. it's very innovative in my opinion.In for 50,000 sharesThis is an easy buy. They already have prototypes on the road and will manufacture for hyundai & kia, while fisker doesnt even have a way to manufacture yetWhere's that guy who suggested Proterra!?                   Dilegence Denied!!Cars look dumb as shit, former BMW executives (probably fired because of how shit their electric cars are), Nvidia makes good graphic cards???

However someone the other day said HCAC is merging with Proterra... so which one is it?This is like 2002 you say it‚Äôs a ev and then it goes to $1200I bought a bunch of the SPAC earlier this week cause some retard posted about it!remindme 2days!Remindme 2 daysHad me at elf. (Wasn‚Äôt with the opener ‚ÄúS‚Äù but elf reminds me of Santa and Santa brings me presents presents on Christmas except for that one time where his gift was a new house for our family except the house was a car)We've already discussed this.

As soon as they announce merger agreement I‚Äôm shorting this EV cash grabIs it actually confirmed for HCAC now or are we all still just guessing.This will be another pump and dump like NKLA, buy for the pump sure but dont hold anything.89 SPACs that had gone public since 2015 have posted an average loss of 18.5%, compared to an average gain of 37.2% for traditional IPOsLet‚Äôs say I buy in but then want to redeem my shares for the $10.30 price. Do brokers charge for that? I‚Äôm
guessing there will be a commission of some kind for submitting the request?!remindme 2daysWait whats the Symbol?So they‚Äôre public on Monday?!remindme 2 daysThey plan to have a subscription service, not sell cars. They seem neat, but not sure I am down on a subscription service play. Also the thing has very limited range, looks interesting that a no for me dawg.Anyone know what the trade symbol is?I am not a stock person neither warrant, so i am a little bit confused. My question is warrant is way cheaper than share, So whats the reason to get share over warrant? Whats the opportunity look like? Thank you so very much!I would like to say I was here just in case this lowbrow was correctHell ya dude looks sexy af - can‚Äôt wait till me and my gf from Roblox can roll in peaceThanks for the info. An all EV zip car but you have the car 24/7 why wouldn't it be successfulSorry for being retarded but how do warrants work? It‚Äôs essentially an option with a 5 year expiration?Lot of people will be disappointed that its not a deal with Proterra. Wonder if there will be a sell off early.Why do their cars swim?Bro, just give me the damn ticker I need to buy calls on... it‚Äôs HCAC for anyone wondering.It's going public via a SPAC, not a reverse merger FYI. Makes it look more legit from the SEC's perspective.

Also: 'The SPAC cautioned that there can be ‚Äúno assurance that a definitive agreement will be entered into or that the proposed transaction will be consummated.‚Äù'This that dumb motley fool commercial again?My first thought seeing those cars:

Any moron can program a car to drive between two lines, but the sheer number of edge cases once you leave the interstate means that full autonomy is still a few years away.Reading these comments, makes me wonder how many people don't know of Golden Nugget merger.Don‚Äôt we have enough shitty EV companies already?So its a goofy car rental business with two goofy awkward founders. The cars look like shit and nobody likes the idea. 

Sounds like a winner I'm inJesus Christ that is one ugly piece of shitYikes.  Just go VLVLY if you believe in the subscription idea.  They have a marketable approach to it.Imagine paying for a car just to have it look as stupid as those thingsThis is great only if they actually merge. The article seems very flakeyJesus another one? I'm losing track of these pump and dumpsOh look, another EV SPAC. Only the 10th one this year. You ever notice that there's really only like 20-25 brands of cars on the road? People don't tend to spend 5 digits on something with 0 track record.

Tesla is the exception to this rule.I'm pretty sure that maths doesn't check out actually, but I'm not 100%. I'm going to fax the figures to a buddy of mine, he owns a calculator, and I'll report back.lolIf you're not yet convinced, I can tell you that you'll quadruple your savings if it hits $44! Such move could really impress your wife's boyfriend!But wait there‚Äôs more! You will make 9x if it reaches 90$!90/11=9??? Sure, why not.You guys are using math?I got some spare change in my car I can send you. Coins are rare these days, too.OP is a much better hype man than the low energy nerds running this company.I canoo believe you‚Äôve done this."Self-d..." you son of a bitch, I'm in!An electric Zipcar. Where's the innovation here?This is 100x better than an EV startup lol.  They take Uber and Lyfts revenue, but don't have to pay drivers, buy gas, and if they decide to sell cars, then proven concept so free money.It's trading under HCAC. Probably a Q4 merge or Q1 2021. They'll let us know soon im guessingWait a minute... we have to wait months for this? I can hardly focus on one stock over the weekend...Downside is also leveraged tho.

Watch this, this video it tells you everything you need to know about how stupid this company is, you can even tell Jay Leno thinks it's BSJust read your DD on them earier, thanks for the solid work dad. Jokes aside though, do you think it could see a moon like NKLA? An actual 10 bagger? I‚Äôm seeing a lot of PT for around 20-25. What‚Äôs your personal pt on this since you are the father of this pump?Canoo or Proterra? Which one is it?Are you still as confident in your original thesis even though it‚Äôs a different acquisition target?Any idea on what blank check company proterra is going to use as their IPO? If I had to choose, I'd rather invest with ProterraHe said it would be proterra or canoo moronHe said it would be proterra or possibly canoo and was a fan of canoo alsoThis is the way!HCACW on TOSI want in too! I'm in UK, so how to do it?I'm in Europe, I use IBKR. I simply bought 100 shares of HCAC.Interactive brokers. The best you can find in Europe. Though, their user interface looks very outdated.Do you think this could be a long-term hold?

The big risk is of course when the ticker changes and the floor is no longer $10It‚Äôs obviously them showing off their tech.  The cars float bruh.I mean everyone knew about it, people have made multiple posts on thisThere have been multiple posts over the past 2 weeks about HCACLmao, yeah I bought $7k worth hoping it would be a Proterra merger, but we'll see what happens hereno one knew for sure until today. Only CanooIf it reaches 30, you‚Äôll have 11x420x3 according to OP.Shares are a better deal right now than warrants

Let's say your risk tolerance is $1000. Shares are currently $11.2. You could buy 787 shares for roughly $8800. If the acquisition doesn't go through, you get $7870 back

Warrants are currently $1.9. If you bought $1000 of warrants you would get 526 warrants which if the acquisition goes through would be 526 shares. So if you have the capital, for the same risk you would get 787 shares vs 526 shares through warrantsFuck yeah it does.Speculation was on Proterra, but Bloomberg published this right as AH closed today.yes agreed, but all that means is tendies ready for the picking, just use stop losses, and keep adjusting them.Did someone say Elon?

You meant https://tfw.canoo.com/Td AmeritradeHCACU is units, which you can tell your broker to split into HCAC stock and HCACW warrants - one unit is one share and 75% of a warrant so you need to buy units in multiples of 4 to redeem a full amount of warrants.

SPACs release units first to incentivize early buyers, then a couple months later they're split and stock/warrants start trading too.Hcac are shares. If the acquisition doesn't go through, you get $10.30 back

Hcac are warrants, if the acquisition does go through and the price goes over $11.50, you get a share for every warrant. If it doesn't go through they expire worthless

Shares are currently the better deal

Let's say your risk tolerance is $1000. Shares are currently $11.2. You could buy 787 shares for roughly $8800. If the acquisition doesn't go through, you get $7870 back

Warrants are currently $1.9. If you bought $1000 of warrants you would get 526 warrants which if the acquisition goes through would be 526 shares. So if you have the capital, for the same risk you would get 787 shares vs 526 shares through warrantsYou can only redeem for $10.30 if an acquisition doesn't go throughI will be messaging you in 2 days on [**2020-08-10 13:09:28 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2020-08-10%2013:09:28%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i5ur34/selfdriving_ev_startup_that_trades_at_11/g0savvr/?context=3)

!remindme 2 daysHCACWith warrants you can lose 100%I think it‚Äôs a nice feature.  If I had to choose between a non swimming car and a swimming car, I‚Äôm getting the one with a bikini 100% of the time.No options.  Only shares (fag) or warrants (less fag)That's why they will buy your shares back if you don't like the merger.There is inherent risk. But he chances of that happening seem to be slim with SPACs these days.literally has cars working and shown on jay lenos YouTube do your own ddYep i say it all the time. People keep saying its going to take over the trucking industry.

One malfunction and that truck tears up the highway and kills several family.  That company is sued to DUST.

but im gonna ride these stocks up and pay off my house until it happens.LolzShort an IPO in the EV market on a SPAC deal in 2020 ?

Lol!SPAC not IPOProbably trained the AI in grand theft auto.What is that?It's not a vaporeware EV company though. Have manufacturing, huge contracts, wide network/connections, valuable tech, and already testing on the road with quite a few working vehicles. With that, it is already a much better company than the past few EV companies. Much, much better. Plus, this company is selling their power train skateboard, not car. So it is not just EV company, it is an advanced mobility EV company.That stuff sucks. The real reason to be excited is they have developed a way to make manufacturing electronic vehicles hella easy. That‚Äôs why Hyundai want them to help make theirs> The cars look like shit

When I first saw them I realized the cars in Westwood S3 were based on these.This one says they are doing a subscription model so people won't have to spend 5 digits on it up front.The thing is this is subscription based and you don‚Äôt have to spend 5 digits.Any update on this math? It‚Äôs too tough for my brain to process.Hold on, I got a buddy who's an expert in self driving EV startups. Let me give him a call and I'll get back to youI‚Äôm interested, but let me get a hold of my friend who‚Äôs an expert in numbers just to be safe.I think Excel can calculate it, I just don't know which squares to put the numbers intoits pronounced 'meth'U wish nerds are running this companyself-d........estruct. Self destruct activated.partnership to provide Hyundai/ Kia w their manufacturing for skateboards + partnership w NVIDIA. those horny little institutional guys are gonna be all over it i betUh, its electric, boogywoogywoogyWait a second.... I‚Äôm already losing money on this ticker. Fool me once... fuck it. I‚Äôm in.The extension is for Dec 31, so it will happen before then unless there‚Äôs another vote for extension.Is it HCAC or HCACU? HCAC is Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp III, HCACU is Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp IV, their current acquisition vehicle and the one mentioned in the article. HCAC III already merged with NRC Group according to their website.Jesus f. Guess it‚Äôs PRPL again this weekYou can buy HCAC now. The ticker change over to canoo won't be for like 2 months.My cousin has lots of warrants. Apparently you don't have to pay anything for them, you can get em for free even.Any other broker than rh or webullNo more China-based stocks for me.  Too much political headwind.As in Suck Elon‚Äôs HCACPage 4 of the S-1 says that warrants will be exercisable at the $11.50 strike starting 30 days after merger and expiring 5 years after that.   

Pretty standard warrant deal.


https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390019002115/fs12019_hennessycap4.htmOnly problem is nobody will pay to get in a shitbox like that when they can pay $1000 for a 20 year old shitbox they can actually ownI say it time and time again. Jay Leno is a bullshit interviewer. A bad host. Your job as host is to make the guests look good by being more prepared.Thanks for sharing the link. But good goly that‚Äôs an ugly carthey‚Äôre not wearing mask, i‚Äôm outIf Canoo is a 10 bagger, I‚Äôm going to quit my job and live stream it here. So if your question is, do I think I‚Äôll quit my job? Then yes, I think so.In the Robinhood market yes.

I‚Äôve done no DD, but I think this market likes new and overhyped technology with low entry points ie amateur investors.

Maybe not moon, but it will go up.This will go NO where near 90.00 like NlkaOne those probably.Proterra is very doubtful.  Apparently the same SPAC made a deal with blue bird buses for some EV stuff and it would be a conflict of interest.  Not sure on the details of what or why, but I‚Äôve seen it thrown around on the internets.Canoo might even be more memey than Proterra to be honestNow who do we suspect Proterra is merging with?Yeah, I was being cynical. I am grateful for his post.The holding company HCAC is on trading212Took a while but found the ISIN: US42589C1045They have products starting next year. The merger is Q4 of this year. Honestly I don't see this dropping below $10 at all. It's an EV company and it will have products before even Rivian.Good enough for me! 

I‚Äôm calling Mammaw and telling her we are taking out a reverse mortgage on MondayNoiceSEC doc seems to say you can request redemption before the extension meeting, or if the acquisition doesn‚Äôt go through then you‚Äôll get cash. Regardless, I‚Äôm just curious if there‚Äôs any brokerage fees associated with the redemption.Oh thats all. üôèLeno drove roadster and cybertruck too, what's your point?Well I guess we‚Äôll never have self-driving vehicles then.Made me lolYeah. Im kinda torn actually. I dont think the subscription thing will work and I cant envision those cars on the road... but at least they have a product they can manufacture. 

I'll probably buy a few grand shares just as a speculative buy.It's called a lease dummyTurns out he sold the calculator.

But, the good news is, he has been unemployed for a while, so he watches a lot of TV in the day time - lot of kid's shows - and he was watching this episode of Peppa Pig where they go over the ten times table, and he is **sure** that they said three *tens* are thirty. So this whole idea that three elevens are going to equal thirty seems off.

As for what it *does* equal, we still don't know, but this is looking fishier by the minute.Hey all, EV startup guy here. Checked the telemetry and we're good to go!Numbers guy here. These are 100% numbers. Buy.How? Did you buy the top of the hype?I think they are doing a vote for another extension on 8/27

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020020671/ea125095-def14a_hennessy4.htmHcac iii is a typo from my understanding.  It is supposed to be hcac iv.HCAC is going to become canoo?Mine came with a new carAre they publicly traded warrants or do you have to purchase shares directly?

EDIT: Just found it myself. I'm retarded.I know we're all autistic here, but if you think the average Yuppie or Gen Z'er would be seen dead in a 1k shitbox over a subscription for something new and trendy then you're sorely mistaken.In 2 years, owning an ICE car is like owning a dvdLet‚Äôs hope broPeople are buying back into the NKLA shit storm, their stock is actually up in the past 2 days. The appetite for hype EV stocks is out of control, way too early to say where it will top outIs that English?Only problem is all the pre merge speculation and hype was about Proterra, so there'll be disappointment from a lot of buyers who anticipated Proterra. There'll have to be a reset over the weekend where everyone buys into Canoo hype. Who knowsThat is the question.Ah thanks. I was looking at CFD and couldn't see it but now I got it.Why are you so confident though?

Ford are trading at less than $7 right now. Ford.Don‚Äôt tell her! Surprise her with the new 0‚Äôs in her acct.  she‚Äôll thank you later.You never know long-term. 2020 is going to be the year of EV stock flops and bulls.

Short-term is probably the safest. 

Not a bad strategy to take out initial investment and just reinvest profits in the company.Lease without the 2 or 3 year commitment and no miles limitOk, best I can do is give you half of what you‚Äôre asking.DefWhat hype? I bought in 7 mins after the first post on this ticker was made. This post is where the hype begins.The 8/27 is to vote for an extension until 12/31YesYou‚Äôre right. RipDoubt it. What happens when it storms and the power goes out? No way for you to drive cause you can‚Äôt charge your car. It‚Äôll take at least a decade before electric cars come close to even 30-40% of cars3/4I thought Jesus was supposed to provide ANSWERS! But disappointment is more what I‚Äôm used to....you can‚Äôt compare share price between companies without looking at the number of shares outstanding. Ford has ~3.9b shares, while HCAC has only 37m shares. Ford is literally 65x more valuable.When Ford gets serious about EV and can make it profitable, that will change. Imagine if they announced an EV Bronco over the weekend. They‚Äôd crush.That's what I meant. The hype from the post on here peaked and then settled down a bitAh ok nice. Just means we get paid quickerü§§> No way for you to drive cause you can‚Äôt charge your car. 

You mean, the power is out so electric motors won't work -- LIKE THE KIND THAT OPERATE GAS PUMPS AT GAS STATIONS?So is your wifeJesus is the way.Fair point, maybe I'm too pessimistic.

What are your expectations for HCAC over the coming weeks/months/years?

I have literally no idea how to play this on Monday tbhAnyone know if I can get my Lambo paint to sample?Right but you can save gas in containers retardMy girlfriend is married.You don‚Äôt have to tell me, she does often enoughIf you have no idea how to play it, a good rule of thumb is don‚Äôt play it. 

But considering this is WSB... go long and be prepared to hold through December."Electricity container:"

https://www.tesla.com/en_CA/powerwall?redirect=noRight, but then you just get a mini A bomb scenario like Beruit if it goes wrong. Think about it.Everybody knows that married girlfriends try harder and cost less.I say that because I have no idea what to expect. I don't know how to manage my expectations and build a strategy from there as a result.

I'm already in quite considerably. Going long would bring much more risk wouldn't it? I also have the weakness of the dollar to worry about as well, given I'm in the UK$30,000 for a good setup


Edit: plus the car itselfThey actually pay you.Are you not in a long position already?Weirdly people use these "electricity containers" rather than keeping gas cans lying around in their garage.I have a small one elsewhere, but I was sitting on a bulk of cash recently. Decided to put it into this.

It hurts to be at work and look at my account and see +80 for the day when I know I could fight the market and suck out +600 or some shit on a day like today.

Fml"Burning man populated by freshmen on acid looking to gamble their student loans."

Pretty much.That‚Äôs all well and good provided you have experience cooking tendies. 

But most us as here have zero skills and are basically trading blind. 

Remember that first batch of tendies you cooked? Remember that sole tendie you put to the side and sliced open to make sure it was internally cooked?

That‚Äôs what we are doing because we are collectively stupid and irrational.Sir, this is WSB. You must be looking for r/personalfinance.Sir this is a casino. I cannot stop the machine when its close to my number.Thank you for the positive advice, *better to work and build your account before playing*‚Äúsome men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned, or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn.‚Äù

-AlfredYou say that but I consistently burn my chicken fingers in the oven and eat burnt dinners. So I don't know....I‚Äôm not here for a couple of crispy tendies. I want the whole fucking farm. If I pull out one tendie once it‚Äôs become two, great. I still need thousands more tendies. Sure I relatively doubled my tendies, but I‚Äôm marginally closer the goal.But the analogy here doesn't completely work because we don't *know* when the tendies are actually fully crisp and golden. We can estimate, sure, but there's always a chance that when we dip out, we do so before our chickens of labour are fully realized.unfortunately I have to wait a day (in this case monday) since my small account is below 25k lolMy pull out game is weak sonThankfully I'm only playing with a fraction of a percent of my actual net worth.

Ol imagine using an oven. We only use microwaves at Wendy‚Äôs, sir.There is this little secret only PhDs in finance know called compound gains. If you can make money with money then when you make money you can use it to make more money. people that dont do this are what are called the poor.What websites are your favorites for doing research?I have done so before and probably will againGood advice and great analogy.

You could say the Burning Man crowd actually moved here due to COVID cancellation.look.. i agree with you, i tend to pull out 50% gains as often as i can, but how come (no joke) many successfull option traders keep saying "let your winners ride?". Am i misunderstanding the phrase? I saw some one make a fairly simple mathmatical formula trying to explain how letting winners run, instead of taking profit at certain margins, was the best idea..  


Now dont get me wrong, on the past 5 option trades if i ever hit 30-50% gain, i force my self to make a decision..  
1. Will i sleep like shit worrying what the % will be when i wake up?  
2. Should it continue to rise based on momentum, TA and potential stimulus/inflation/bill -suprises?  
3. Am i willing to let contract expire worthless based on the initial value?  


Mostly i used to let winners ride, and it fuckd me, and now i take profit more often and i feel like im making my way back (ups, just jinxed it), however i keep hearing that same shit? Is it perhabs just the fuckers selling the contracts slining this phrase, trying to mess with us degenerate cumbuckets?What are your strategies for monthly options that are down 30 to 40 percents then?Wait, it's not? I'm at the wrong place.I fucking died when I read thatü§£üòÇIf you're not doing even a little research when you're throwing cash, why throw cash? It takes a few minutes to educate yourself on specific positions.

Play earnings. Look at how the stock has performed recently. Is it overvalued? How are competitors comparing with their EPS compared to the position you want?

It took 20 minutes of research on PLUG Wednesday night for me to triple my investment. Because I did research.Where are the comps btw? Mods are slacking I haven't seen a waitress since I got here.You can trade options on webull everyday with a cash account if you really want your fixI‚Äôve heard that reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets is pretty goodThat's an oven that has no temperature dial. Steer clear.Research doesn‚Äôt mean shit in this market. It‚Äôs all sentiment, doesn‚Äôt matter what the company is valued at or what it‚Äôs done in the past. Everyone is trading in the dark and anyone saying different is just a lying gambler like the rest of us.but if not playing calls then account grows slowly. would you not play options though unless its a spread?  i was doing great until today, all my calls are sept and mostly aapl, but that was a big lesson to get 2-3 days of crazy gains wiped. Honestly im not sure what to do. I want to just leave this all alone since long expiry. But on your point I think yeah locking profits .. fuck its hard but its the right thing. Then next key would be to split like 100% original and 50% profit into stocks , 50% on next option play. seems ok?What are some of your goto sources?Lmao nerd. I got pump too but that's because pumping up stocks is cool.

Also got in on RKT because rockets go to the moon like America did. üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏no PDT?So cut my losses and reposition instead of diamond hands.My problem exactly, the research I've done hasn't amounted to meaningful reaction in the market. One day something is doing well, and the next day Trump says or does something strange and it goes down. And the third day the same thing goes up. Who knows.It's always all sentiment. Pretty much always has been. If a company is expected to have good earnings, there will be a run up and fuck all will happen when those earnings actually come out. People trade on what they think the price will be in the future, not what it should be now.Yeah you can‚Äôt make a career out of this, it‚Äôs just a casino where the house doesn‚Äôt always win(I mean market makers do but that‚Äôs basically a commission). My buddy decided he wanted to become a day trader like 6 years ago and I tried to tell him it‚Äôs not sustainable and no matter how hard you work to learn and understand it‚Äôs still just gambling. He quit after 2 years of getting up daily at 6am(west coast) and working so hard.

My favorite company out there, investing in infrastructure, renewable energy, real estate and private equity. One of the best management teams on the market. I think they may actually surprise here.

I didn't get it.We knowWhat are profits? I don't see that button...profits are so yesterdayIt's the thought of no stimulus that is already caused a sell off. Monday will be green AF like every Monday past 2 months. The bigger problem is all the free tendy stocks have run out of steam and people need to know what the next fsly prpl and ddog stock isIt's cute that you think there are profitsDoubled my money.

This pullback will just be before the pump up to elections.. so you may want to buy this little dip. It may dip next week, but that is when you buy in for the election.What are Profits? 

Never heard of that...You know what comes after 69, scope.I really thought the lack of a stimulus bill would trigger a sell off. But so far, the market has wanted to blast off for the moon for no discernible reason I can see. Even the pullback today was nothing much. Green Monday, green Tuesday, green all the fucking days except Friday. The market makes no sense but it can't be stopped.

If no stimulus, historic unemployment, and an incoming eviction crisis can't kneecap it, what the fuck will? All out annihilation, maybe.

*Maybe.*So long as everyone buys SLV I'll be just fineI had a 300 percent winner and my greedy self didn't cash in :(. Don't be like me fellow autists.You see, people here wants to become losspornstars. profits wont help themThe problem for me is, I take profits religiously. But then I use the profits for new plays based on market conditions, what's moving, etc. Smart, right? Why then do these new plays always tank and take my hard earned profits with them? 

/sI pulled out of RKT. Will buy back after it stops being a meme stock[deleted]Only risky position I'm holding is an option on SLV and some penny stocks.  
Just hope that SLV goes back to $27 next week.theres gonna be a stimulus by the 14th at the latest lol stonks go upI‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only oneCramer has a sell button.

Walmart is in pretty much the same boat if you want some diversification to your degenerate gambling.

Now that the meme gang has arrived, I'm out and closed positions this morning, but wish you the best of luck. Don't hold through earnings, observe AH movements and play the run-up.Sold today in case we get a big dump Monday with no stim bill. I‚Äôll buy back in either way.That stock barely seems to move at all.Home depot never disappoints during hurricane seasonIt will drop after ER cud it‚Äôs run upBuying ITM call spreads seems like the pussy but correct moveFlir was the last straw, not going to get fooled by earnings anymoreI'm already going balls deep on Walmart earnings.

The Warren Buffet swinging old balls YOLO play.Bought 8/21 272.5 calls Monday and sold for 60% profit today. Expecting a dump Monday but hoping to buy back in. Good luck fellasAn actual decent play in WSB? What is 2020?Idk, I‚Äôve been in a few times recently. It was nothing close to before times busy. I‚Äôll be surprised if they announce great numbers.Solid plan post positionsIM IN BITCHESI don‚Äôt know if I should hold through earnings on my 270c 8/28 that I bought 2-3 weeks ago. Right now it‚Äôs ITM but I‚Äôm just about breaking even (fuck theta gang). I‚Äôve actually never held any options post an earning day due to seeing a lot of people getting burned on the IV crush. I‚Äôm not quite sure how my call option will play out given that it‚Äôs purchased that far back... just curiousI'm inAlready bought calls on Friday.  Also bought Low which has its earnings on the same daySpreads are the wayI like thisI'M IN!earnings will be lower.Low, HD, and BJs here lolMy 8/21 $285C are currently down 30%. :/ bought it as it was going up thinking it would just run like overstocked.Man I miss live roulette & blackjack. 

The instant gratification of table games hits with that dopamine in different kind of way.That is my favorite way to play roulette. Two separate 50sI‚Äôve heard Walmart might not run up. Idk thoDon‚Äôt leave out Target. Earnings run up seasonBeautifulI‚Äôll buy calls and you‚Äôll see it move bigly. Just not in the direction you‚Äôd want.It‚Äôs moved 5$ this week aloneEveryone has an opinion, yours just seems to be shitGeniusYep but we‚Äôre not worried about that. Entire point is to make money from the run up so make sure you sellmaybe not, remember Apple split might make HD #2 stock on the Dow.. i'm betting that it rises even higher post-earningsWhy ITM? You don't think it'll move up at all before ER? You could buy a 50/50 (buy itm sell otm for about half the difference in strikes) and probably have a good chance of either getting close to full gains by ER or hold through ER if it's not moved enough.Not playing earnings. Just using the run upnice alex jones referenceis this sarcasm?You're welcomeIv crush doesn‚Äôt discriminate.

If lady luck is on your side you may wake up the next morning with a shit load of chips in your pockets!Why not?I think it will run just on the sheer fact that in most places the only businesses that have been steadily full of people and constantly open are big box stores, not to mention the huge explosion in order pickup etc.Open a pcs or ccs when iv goes big to take advantage of crushyup, play the runup.  hold through earnings and risk getting burned and IV fucked.Good luck to youUnintended. Pretty common term I thought.Spreads yesSucks to su‚Äî not be sucked dudeThey had some Walmart+ coming out but it got delayedPriced in. No new news for +He is right. You buy and sell on the day of the earnings. NOT AFTER.Hey no talking bad about our favorite su baeya I heard about that I still think people will hear Walmart earnings and once it gets some momentum it‚Äôll go but i guess we‚Äôll see idkMoving from RH to tdameritrade was like leaving my dumb college girlfriend for her abusive step mother. Sure she buys me cigarettes but Sally never pegged me. 

I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is the big brokers will still fuck you, they just have the decency to do it in broad daylight. There‚Äôs fewer games but unless you‚Äôre a whale, they still get a juicy cut of every transaction. 

Something something.. owe the bank a thousand that‚Äôs your problem.. bank a million your problem..You don‚Äôt have to worry about a wide bid/ask spread if you‚Äôre buying $0.01 call options and they expire worthless.Common misconception: Robin Hood did not "steal from the rich and give to the poor.". He returned money to the people that was stolen from them by their government. Kind of changes the whole narrative when you look at it that way.Take your bitching back to your broker that literally 10 years ago had no problem skinning 50$ per trade off of people.RH is literal trash. Im working on liquidating my 5k i have in there and moving it between my tastyworks and td account. Friday they royally fucked me. I was making 100% on 1 debit spread for bynd. I had a limit sell in place to sell if the price went above .95 it was sitting at .96, .97 and even 1.00 at point early morning. It never sold. I dropped the limit to .90 again it was above .90 never sold. I dropped it again to .80, never sold. Then bynd lost any traction they had and consistently dropped the rest of the day so RH in all their glory auto sold my spread for a 25% loss.  Same shit happened with a CLX call. Had a limit sell at a certain percentage, it hadn't sold for a while luckily it sold 1 minute before market close with a nice 15% profit.

Fuck RH.Serious question, why should I care what Citadel paid to process my order if it closed at the limit I selected? It‚Äôs not like that money comes out of my account.Idk I use both thinkorswim and Robinhood and Robinhood has just such a clean UI.

Who gives a flying fuck I'm making tendiesI swear RH stole money from me a week ago; I had a SPY 323 call that was OTM and they sold it before it went anywhere near ITM and it proceeded to go way ITM.

I 100% believe their algorithms detected this upcoming spike, sold my call to themselves, and they profited. I asked why they would do this (sell an OTM call automatically) and got banned and harassed by the mods on /r/Robinhood. I totally understand the principle of selling an ITM call to avoid being exercised but they DID NOT do this.Free gets em every time.

0% APR for 12 months, 23% after."Robinhood likes to set quite a large bid-ask spread as the default for options"... this line gives me the idea that you don't really know what you are talking about.It‚Äôs like they say in Rounders ‚Äúit‚Äôs immoral to let a sucker keep their money‚Äù people should know by now robinhood is fucking them over heavy it‚Äôs not secret but they still use it. At some point you have to realize their loss is our gain as they are the ones paying our overfilled contractsI always use limit orders. I expect to get my ask/bid price whether I use Robinhood or any broker.  I'm not going to bitch if Robinhood makes a buck here and there that doesn't hit my account.man all i know is 10 years ago investing was out of reach for many of us specially me. was looking to trade with wellsfargo and it was ridiculous. hd was at 70 i was a cashier and could get 10% of the stock, but just thinking about paying 5 dollars per trade adds up.

things can happen with an order of that size 20k, but when you start it really helps to not have to directly pay 5 dollar per trade.

i bought shares at the beginning and this really helped.

Now I‚Äôm a millionaire lol üòùüòùIf you think this is bad, go read *Flash Boys* by Michael Lewis. If you don't have time for the book, a movie called *The Hummingbird Project* is inspired by/loosely based on *Flash Boys*.

I'm not mad at Robinhood. I had an account there at one point, and they created a retail interest in investing that no other brokerage even came close to, which I think is awesome. Every younger person got started there (I'm late 20's so their target market). But to me, it's a great indicator of investing knowledge. If someone is actively trading and still uses Robinhood, it's a clear sign they don't understand the nuances of brokerage firms and options trading.

HFT is a fascinating topic for sure, but what kills me is that these companies are so enormous but so nuanced, with infinite amounts of money, they can just get away with anything. I mean, Citidel hired former fed chair Ben Bernanke so he can go call his friends at the fed if anything bad happens, for fucks sake.

 [https://www.citadel.com/leadership/dr-ben-s-bernanke/](https://www.citadel.com/leadership/dr-ben-s-bernanke/) 

There are also HFT firms that claim they have never had a red day, ever. I forget which one it was that said that, but here's one an article where a firm only had one red day in \~4 years.

[https://www.businessinsider.com/virtu-hft-only-one-losing-day-2014-3](https://www.businessinsider.com/virtu-hft-only-one-losing-day-2014-3) 

But hey, fair market for all participants, right? lmaowait, so you mean a brokerage is making an obscene amount of money on traders, regardless of their expertise? Fake News.  
next you'll be telling me that cryp koin brokers are Superman 3ing everyone by dragging their decimal points and rounding it into their own account.  

Sir, this is madnessI executed a credit spread on the first try using tasty works! 

I went to close a 1.85 NET  on RH yesterday. The price changes to 1.77, I put in 1.75, it went to 1.72. I put in 1.7 and it sells at 1.74 then the price to buy it back goes up to 1.9

Wtf!Im a noob and never understood this. It just hit me like a bag of bricks. I would always have to adjust my sell price for options .01 lower, aka $1 to go through.Isn't this literally every company? I have been index fund trading for years and one of the major things is fees. That's why Vanguard became the best in the business. Robinhood exists because it makes trading individual stocks and options accessible. Robinhood is actively changing the market to something that I believe is better.

Right now, I think they have the slickest UI and makes it easy to know the basics. As you get more complex trades and more intricate strategies you may/will outgrow Robinhood. There are 10 million users on Robinhood and many of them probably only are on Robinhood because of how easy it is. I think that is a win. Who cares if you place an order to buy apple at 440 and it didn't fill till the price dropped to 439. The fact is that many people would never have purchased that share at all without Robinhood.I turned 6 thousand dollars into 39 thousand dollars on robinhood bro, I honestly don‚Äôt care how they make money, if anything they deserve it! Because of them I‚Äôve made a killing while laying in bedIn a game designed to allow one man to take money out of another mans pocket it seems disingenuous to complain about the vig.SEC mandates best execution for orders from all brokers including robin hood.  Firms are paying for order flow because market making is *risky.*  When the other side of your trade is an algorithm or an experienced trader, they are usually purchasing at that price because they know something you don't, and believe the current price is wrong.

Retail traders also usually think the current price is wrong, but they are also usually stupid and less knowledgeable, which makes their incoming order flow more lucrative in general.I‚Äôve been with E*trade from the beginning, and I‚Äôm more than satisfied. 

TLDR; ROBINHOOD IS TRASHThe only reason to use RH is their UI looks good and will get more upvotes on WSB. The Schwab app won't even let me take screenshots.It still fucking blows my mind that people use Robinhood.

It sells your shit for you and you end up losing money? It crashes all the time? It makes up bogus bid/ask spreads?

How fucking hard is it to look up quality apps or brokers for you retards. At this point it's just funny to me that RH users  continue to get fleeced and say, "Thank you Daddy, may I have another?"Robinhood still the truth frfrI‚Äôve made $10,000 purchases of stock before and I remember the fee being like less than 50 cents I don‚Äôt know where that fee number comes from is Apple an exception or somethingRH does have the gamey UX advantage but other brokers will probably rip them off sooner or laterJust cause you‚Äôre shit at gettin trendies doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre stealing from you broI think if people pay attention to order flow as long as your getting the lowest price you would pay who really cares. It called a limit price not using market fills will guarantee you get what you want not what they want just saying. I haven't been disappointed I use order flow to my advantage. Not to mention I use all the brokers so like I said I get filled at the price in with all the brokers I use.

I just started using them (again, after a long hiatus) this past week and while they do have "quite high" fees and commissions, it's truly not worse than TD and others--and man, the additional services and benefits they offer are quite nice.  

Obviously TOS is kind for scripts, scanners, blah, but I don't care to trade on them, and again, they're quite upfront about their fees, etc.  And none of them have seemed "bad", per se, no?Unpopular opinion: if you‚Äôre a half decent trader 65 cents is nothing ....NSTAFL. Why you mad? You‚Äôre not paying anything right? 

Move to Tasty.

Your post is shit, ends with "I want to do more research."

You sound like the brokerage house people who need to make commission.I wish I could find a woman who bought me smokes and pegged me.TD just wants to look you in the eyes while they fuck you.Think or Swim by TD is objectively better and cheaper than RH tho. Every contract that you buy or sell with TD will cost you $0.65, but with RH, if you want to get filled on an order, you have to adjust your order accordingly, which ends up costing you more than the $0.65 than TD charges. For example, if you wanna buy something that's trading at $100, you'll have to buy it for $101, even if the bid/ask spread is $99/$100. Same with selling. If the bid/ask spread is $99/$100, you'll have to sell at $98, or else you won't get filled. With ToS, you get filled pretty much instantly. Plus you get way more information, so at least you *feel* smarter when you're losing your life savingsI have a tdameritrade account, but havent made the switch yet. TBH think or swim looks fucking confusingTook your advice... went into my local TDA dropped trou spread my cheeks and asked the manager to stick it in... long story short he said my account doesn‚Äôt qualify for that level of ‚Äúservice‚Äù and then flagged my account a pattern day trader.

https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eyg9h3/why_doesnt_everyone_buy_options_when_theyre_at_001/It doesn't change anything! The reason the government was able to steal from the people was because they had the money and soldiers to do so.  In Robin Hood's time, the rich were the monarchy or the lords.  It's not like Robin Hood was giving Medievel Jeff Bezos his taxes back too.  Robin Hood was quiet literally stealing from the rich (government) and giving to the poor (working class).  Either you were a rich landowner or a poor serf, and the rich landowners were in charge of the governments of the world (Still are, really).

It doesn't change the narrative at all.  All you did was point out that the rich people Robin Hood was stealing from were also formed the government.

If modern day Robin Hood were to steal from Halliburton and give the profits to poor Iraqis it would be the exact same concept.Sounds like a distinction without a difference to me.[removed]Rich and the government are same.It‚Äôs still happening, but the skims are hidden under the guise of ‚Äúzero commissions‚Äù trading. Robinhood is still eating, and they are eating way more than other firms due to a lack of transparency with respect to their payment for order flow.That‚Äôs probably because someone wasn‚Äôt bidding what you were asking. I‚Äôve seen the same thing with debit spreads. Bid will be $.50 ask will be $1.50, price shows $1.00. You can have a sell order all day long but if a bidder doesn‚Äôt meet you, you‚Äôre not going to sell it.I left Robinhood for this reason. Bullshit order routing. But still fuck OP even though I agree with his underlying premise that RH is trash.It does come out of your account if your fills are consistently worse. You just don‚Äôt realize it.Because at the time you got filled there‚Äôs a better price you could‚Äôve gotten but they skimmed you and filled for a price you asked.

The point is whenever you place a trade don‚Äôt you wanna always get the best price? This doesn‚Äôt happen with free commissions.Your buy orders placed at 99 get executed only when the actual price is 98. 
Sell order at 101 gets executed when real price is 102Because you likely should have filled at a 1-2% better price.I agree that the UI is easier. Other platforms need to adapt.If I'm making enough tendies to live in the pool house, I'm Gucci üèäon day to expire? RH executes automatic sales on day to expire contracts at around 2pm. trading 0 day contracts is risky as fuck on RH. Also can't even tell if your second paragraph is sarcasm or not lol.In comparison with other brokerages I believe it is larger. But I shouldn‚Äôt speculate.Reading that book is what got me into trading LOL. And I got in via Robinhood LMAOFresh perspective.

I really love vanguard btw. Use them for my Roth IRA and they are fantastic.I guess the UI and ease of use makes up for all that other shit. When I first opened ToS, I nearly closed it instantaneously. If the big brokers were to polish their software, RH would be dead in the water the very next day.Pretty sure what OP is talking about isn't a fee you'd ever see... It's basically baked in because they're routing the order to a specific place, so you're not getting the best price. 

So, if apple is trading at $199.95, you may end up getting filled a few cents higher, when in reality you should have been filled at that price. In this case, you wouldn't see it. 

These order routing shenanigans and the kickbacks they get for them is how Robinhood makes their money.Deleted that. I think it‚Äôs good for barriers to entry to be removed and I guess I‚Äôm morbidly impressed with how they gameified and profitized this. Applaud is wrong word.He doesn't need to. There's already good trading apps out there better than Robinhood.That's what I told him and r/investors invaded WSB to downvote me. Biggest bullshit ever.How do they force people to stay in options? I‚Äôm curious, I haven‚Äôt seen thatOn desktop ToS, your P/L YTD can be found under Monitor > Activity and Positions.  It's not all-time, but you can always add in previous years.I forgot you guys can‚Äôt read here.Is your mom lost?Just like Di Caprios Venice tripsHawt!This is not true of RH. For larger spreads it can take a while to fill but I‚Äôve never had to over-bid the ask or under-ask the bid to get a fill.

If I want to limit buy at 10.00$ and limit sell at 15.00$ all of that profit is mine.I used to pay $6 a trade through Sharebuilder. I don't mind being skimmed for pennies to buy/sell at will.You‚ÄôreHow is the price of the spread going up and down if people arent buying/selling?What‚Äôs your issue with me or this post?It gets filled at the limit I setHow do you know they‚Äôre consistently worse then?Is Robinhood execution that bad? Most of the payment for order flow I have heard of is more like 25% of spread, not 1% off the top of equity orders.maybe 0.01%In a technical sense, ThinkorSwim is superior due to the various forms of TA, such as RSI, DMI, Full stochastic, Bollinger bands etc. A daytrader scalping would never use RH due to it‚Äôs poor TA. It actually amazes me to see such high balance accounts on RH, people seem to value simplicity over Technical analysis nowadays. Seems that way with everything including iOS market shareUntil they come up with a better UI I won‚Äôt switch, if I have to watch a YouTube video on how to use your system, then that system is bad. The fact that they won‚Äôt adapt to the 21st century with a streamlined UI makes me want to invest in Robinhood when they IPO.His first paragraph doesn‚Äôt sound like a 0 DTE option, sounds like something much later dated. Very odd if they did sell, or shit just expired and he was too retarded to realize that‚Äôs what the dates meant.FWIW Bernie Madoff pioneered paid routing so we shouldn't be surprised.Oh, thanks. I have noticed a difference in market pricesThey all do the same shit.You stop crying too mother fucker. Here is un upvote.If you try and sell it will just be ignored and it forces you to stay in it until the end.Positions or BAN!Break your arms and then mom will take care of you.Go on.....Depends on the volume.  I've definitely had to over/under bid for low volume fills, but almost never have issues with stuff like SPY.It‚Äôs very powerful and complicated to use. RH doesn‚Äôt have as much functionality but their UX is infinitely more intuitive. Add that with 0 fees whatsoever and most beginners will choose RHIt's a pain in the ass to learn. It took me around 20 hours straight learning how to use every single thing in there so I wouldn't fuck up one gametime came, but I would honestly say that it was worth it. Going from Robinhood to td was a night-and-day difference (once I actually got comfortable with tos's interface). I'd rather pay the 64 cents a contract than ever go back to Robinhood, and I don't see that commission staying around for much longer seeing as how sucessful Robinhood is for option traders.I'm sure if I watched a short youtube video or something I could figure it out quickly. It's just Robinhood has ridiculously user friendly UI that I'm used to for about four years now[removed][removed][removed]https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-ppp-ayn-rand/in-sign-of-the-times-ayn-rand-institute-approved-for-ppp-loan-idUSKBN248026

üòÇGiven that I am guessing it was something about taxes (deleted now), the Sixteenth Amendment is a better clause to point to for income taxes.I routinely get filled at a price better than my limit with TDA and Fidelity and almost always get filled at the limit price with RH. I make more money by paying the 65¬¢ and getting a better fill than if I pay $0 with RH.I think What they are saying is yes, you sold it for 15 but you could have solid it for say 15.10 and RH is skimming that difference. 

This is why I don‚Äôt mind paying 65 cents commission for options on Schwab. My orders consistently get filled for less than my limit on buy and more than limit on sells. Add in the fact that there are actually people you can call if you need service instead of some unmonitored email box the 65 cents isn‚Äôt too bad. I do wish the app was as intuitive as RH tho, you can‚Äôt beat their UI for simplicity.You have 2 legs to worry about.  Maybe your long leg is getting a lot of volume, but your short isn‚Äôt getting any attention.  The price of the spread will change because one leg is getting fucked with and the other isn‚Äôt. Just because someone is willing to buy your long leg doesn‚Äôt mean you have a seller lined up for the short leg.Spreads on robinhood... üòÇIn my same example, if someone increased their bid to $.60, the mid and therefore the premium, would be displayed at $1.05, a $.05 jump. However you still can‚Äôt sell it for that price as now the highest someone would pay for it is $.60. 

Hope that helps.You will find this more common with options, people can and do update their prices all the time without the stock or option needing to be traded. Oftentimes with stock there are so many more shares being traded at any given time that you may not notice people changing limits to adjust the bid/askYou speak the truth. And it hurts. üò≠None of us like youWhich only fills when its a bad number. The price will move enough to where that limit price is cheap for them and bad for you. Sure you liked the limit price when stock was 101, well now it's 99 and your order filledI guess their point is that, yes your order is filled at the limit but the actual price of the security at that time is a bit higher, i.e., your order won't get filled unless the price is a bit higher than your limitHow you know they arent worse?

I mean is rh developing an app, hiring staff and filling trades for free out of the goodness of their hearts? No they arent. They are a business and they want to make money. The issue is that instead of being upfront with their fees, they hide them with worse fills and lack of price improvement.

If you dont want to believe that fills are worse, than that's up to youThis is a circumstantial evidence based off the SEC filings about what citadel and other e-trading giants are paying RH. As cited in the WSJ, it can be nearly 60x as much as Schwab gets.

Citadel and others are willing to pay more to RH... a lot more.

It does not take much of a leap in logic to realize why, as the payment for order flow parameters are not publicly listed anywhere by RH.

This gives RH and Citadel together avenues to massive profits by filling orders in a way that skims off the top aggressively for every order placed.

People don‚Äôt notice a few pennies here and there, but multiply it per user, and per trade, and the profits are insane.

This is not to mention my suspicions of how much they are skimming on options...Not with options.I'm sure most people only use RH strictly for trading, I know alot of other who love RH simplicity but will use TOS or webull for TA.It is 0DTE he is taking about.I‚Äôm not at all surprised, unfortunately.My understanding is that it also leads to shitty fills for anything like spreads and iron condors, which are already hard enough to get filled/close. Really for anyone serious about trading, you're better off paying the fees to a real broker and skipping the shady shit RH does.Thank you!420, 69, then robinhood investor getting fucked up the ass, in that orderI mean for really low volume that‚Äôs an issue with the stock not the platformAsk yourself. Do u want money or u want funny confetti from RH?

One option trade bud spread  cost at RH can buy me any steam computer game fro sure[removed]modern retardHell even E*TRADE. 

I fat fingered closing a credit spread for .2 when I intended .02.  They filled me for the ask at .04.

I‚Äôm pretty sure robinhood would have fucked me.By the way im not saying i would never switch from RH, I hate the UI of TDA, TOS has some UI issues but seems better than RH overall but doesnt seem to have 2FA from what I can tell.if an option expires worthless do you still have to pay the fee?I mean they have to make money somehow. I would prefer to get my desired price with no fees than have to factor fees into every trade I do.Ahhh never thought of that one.New to spreads, only been doing options for a year.To be fair, none of us like each other either.This.This is why whenever I put in an option order at RH, I have my TD ToS open.Which isn't true as they have to display the nbbo as the securities industry regulates that.  If they place a limit order and it fills they got the price they were expecting, however many times other brokerage firms will price improve your order as you could have gotten filled below the limit for buys or a better price on sells and that is where the market makers make their money.‚ÄúHow do you know bigfoot exists?‚Äù

You: ‚ÄúHow do you know it doesnt exist! If you want to believe it doesn‚Äôt exist thats up to you‚ÄùThe skimming off options has to be so insanely high.  Only being able to trade in .05 increments should shout abuse.I obviously don‚Äôt know how order flow works, but if it‚Äôs legal to fill orders in anything other than first come first serve against the best available price at the time, then it seems to me the problem is the SEC or whoever regulates this is massively failing at their job of protecting investors. Is Robinhood and Citadel screwing people? Sounds like probably, but we don‚Äôt know for sure because of what seems like regulatory failure.And fuck all 9 of you that down voted me. You know deep down in your heart that I'm right.

OSTK 125c 8/21Placed the same limit order on RH and TOS this week and it took 2 extra days to fill at RH lol[removed]Yeah, E-Trade is pretty good. I like it. Ive had it fill orders for better than I had my limit set.Use ToS for pricing, RH for the trading.Most brokerages charge a fee when you sell and buy a contract. If you bought and sold then you have to pay twice. Fidelity does reduce the fee based on contract value. If you bought an option that expires worthless you already paid the commission fee. Since you‚Äôre not reselling it there aren‚Äôt anymore fees.

Of course RH doesn‚Äôt charge a commission but they‚Äôre making money elsewhere.For sure, it def makes it easier to do the math in your head when you don‚Äôt have to think about any fees. 

On the flip side, I would say I consistently get contracts for 1-2 cents less than my limit price which completely offsets the commission so I don‚Äôt really think about it much either.Spreads are great, except on Robinhood for reasons that will become all too apartment to you, if that haven't already.I've had the same experience as you, and I now try to only mess with higher volume options, otherwise I end up watching the bud/ask jump all over including above my sell order, with no results.Or ourselvesI had that happen a few times with both stocks and options. The shown price was higher than the limit (for selling) and it didn't execute. It can be explained due to volume a bit but why display that price then?

EDIT: reposted comment without mentioning the c wordSo if you read the op and my post, you will see that there is evidence for fills being worse. Shkuey implies that he doesn't believe that but has no support.

So really what is your point?You‚Äôve obviously not used TD and don‚Äôt know their lightning fast execution compared with RH bro.> Only being able to trade in .05 increments should shout abuse.

Schwab does the same thing on certain options. It's not an RH thngI work in this industry. The SEC determines the increments.

[http://www.marketswiki.com/wiki/Penny\_Pilot\_Program](http://www.marketswiki.com/wiki/Penny_Pilot_Program)

The current increments are outlined by the following csv files:

[https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market\_statistics/penny\_tick\_type/?mkt=cone](https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/penny_tick_type/?mkt=cone)From what I understand, the problem is that a lot of orders are not public but kept in dark pools.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pool

Robinhood and other brokerages make money by routing their order flow to these participants before putting them on the public exchange, giving them an opportunity to internalize the trades and skim a few cents (, or use the information to engage in less than legal practices such as front running).when you put it like that everyone here - except the biggest mouth-breathers - will agree with youthis is what I currently do most of the time, especially since I can see option price history on there.Thats why ive been slowly moving funds to tastyworks and tos.I did not, I asked a question.RH is ass. Not sure why I still use it. I constantly have to cancel an order to get the fucking thing closed. So annoying.Ahh didn‚Äôt know this. Was actually looking for a new broker I‚Äôm fed up with RH. Any suggestions? Considering fidelity.This is the correct answer.

I would also like to point out that you can work around the limitations by placing complex orders. If you create a vertical spread for example, you can pick a limit price in 1 cent increments and your legs can get filled at 1 cent increments.I hear ya. I went to WeBull1. The .05 increments is not on every option, but on certain options. [It's an SEC thing](https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/86122/why-do-some-options-trade-in-5-cent-increments)

2. I mainly use Schwab (as I bank with them). I used to use RH, but everytime I used RH I make bad plays, so I use RH for graphs/chains and then insert the order in Schwab.

IMO, the only thing I consider superior about Schwab is that you can but 0dte options (whether this is a good thing depends on your personal risk tolerance). Otherwise the "order flow" boogeyman is just that. Sure Schwab (or TD or Fidelity) gives me better fills, but it also charges me $0.65/contract for the privilege. This really only affects small contracts (unfortunately that includes SPY). That means if I buy a SPY contract for 1.00 ($100), I technically pay 100.65. If RH forces me to raise my limit 1.05, I might be paying 4.40 more (No way in hell I would raise my limit by 5 cents though so I'm not sure how relevant this it). However I always have a target number, so if I plan to make more than X% of my cost basis, the fees don't really matter.

Also considering that Citadel is the largest option market maker, they are making money off of me regardless. 

Personally, I like RH interface a lot, but most of my money is in Schwab already which is why I stick with them.I'm loving tasty works. Way more info. I'm using rh to see what I want to do then doing it on tasty until I get the hang of it.

My 2c.Probably downvotes for this... But I wouldn't touch the storage industry. It's been a race to rock bottom price in the storage world for 5-10 years. 

I implemented NetApp for several years and watched their prices drop year after year as competitors entered and price wars for disks went on. While there will always be customers that need all flash storage for throughput, Pure is certainly not alone in offering it.  

Let alone the competition of the big dogs - Dell/EMC, Hitachi...AND all of the cloud world. Everyone and their brother offers cloud storage now, again different target than big companies that need the speed of large flash arrays, but the easy money in storage is gone.

Play earnings as you like in wsb fashion, but this entire industry isn't something to buy shares or be in at all for any length of time past earnings imo.Dbx earnings = guhhhh. I would avoid this playTheir growth has significantly chilled out. What is the near term catalyst? I don‚Äôt see the playThis post was flaired as DD so it's on the DD list.

Knew a senior guy there... I like it. Low risk on down turn... lots of upside. Well laid out sir.Look at the graph fucking invert it this company is a kangaroo. Puts now call at the next peak.Your share value gets diluted too much. Growing as fast or faster than their revenue. 

https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/PSTG/pure-storage/basic-shares-outstandingFuck me that chart is ugly. You be top of range rn headin'down to $10 shortly.FWIW I work in storage, and I think Pure will eventually failed. They pegged themselves into an old trend of having custom hardware and targeting a niche high end market. They are now trying to expand their  TAM, but they are not "software-defined" product, they sell an appliance. I think Pure will eventual lose out to the hardware commodity wave. May they still grow for a time (years) taking share from the dinosaurs in the field (EMC/DELL, NTAP) yes. But in the long run, I don't think Pure will be around forever. 

Full Disclosure: I work at a competitor that is not public, so I may be biased.People selling homes and moving. Need storage. I‚Äôm a customer. I‚Äôm in. Thanks for the tldr.

Btw: daily chart looks like a rising wedge. BearishNo no. Last time I saw a long pstg dd by an employee I got fucked with calls.LmaoPretty much sums up.

Go ahead and help us pump it tho; Needs a catalyst...Former EMC (Xtremio, we got bought) guy who competed against them....Pure is legit AF.Yeah fuck that opk guy.You just made me laughYou‚Äôre welcomeI sold my 270s on 8/5. FmlMy new strategy of selling my calls when I hit 30%ish gains has been working great on this roller coaster of a stock market. Previously I had been getting killed hoping for multi-day rallies only to have things go stagnant and suck up all my earnings.

But it does cause me to miss out on stuff like this FB rally and the AMD rally which hurts really bad. Sold most of my FB calls when it popped to $250. Sold the rest when it popped again to $260.I was watching this fucking strike as I claimed "this is the top" for a full day yesterday.

I believe a few min after open yesterday you could have bought contracts for around 0.08, sold around 11.00 mid morning today.

Could have turned 300 bucks into ~44,000.

So you will want to learn only buying covered calls.

That is every 100 shares you sell a call on top otm.

Look up covered calls and only do it after the market corrects and has dips greater than 4% and then hold.

You will want to just continue in share trading.

The other 10%, you get to kiss your entire collateral goodbye.good thing the losses and earnings happened in the same tax cycleI've got a long way to go. Got fucked on Monday the 13th of July holding MSFT calls. 

Studied a bit about option spreads and I'm slowly making gains.well if you take a look at TNA they have been growing steadily the past 3 months, if you sell a cash-covered put at $34 for 08/14 with 70k, you would get around $2000 from premiums within a week, I personally find this one a pretty safe bet too, it's not a meme stock like SPCE or TSLA that jump all over the fucking place$1000 a week is if you put down 35k for collateral, but if you get forced to buy then just go to selling calls and keep collecting premiumBeing forced to buy stock at a discount will not wipe out your collateral 10% of the time. If anything it sets you up for more profitthe best thing about the march crash was the absence of theta gang autists commenting about their slow and steady gainsThe dude is writing csp not writing put spreads>happened in the same tax cycle

Even if they didn't it's fine as long as the losses come first.  If you have $50k cap losses in a previous year you aren't paying any cap taxes this year until you pass $50k, assuming US tax law.Spreads=way to goThank you for the honest advice. I will look further.  Yeah I don't know where to actually look for good advice but this is usually just amusing.Look at 2 other wsb posts in the past 24 hours for some DD. Personally think this is a great play. It always has a small runup prior to earnings. Get in now while IV is low and ride the wave up until Tuesday then sell. It's so stable and the prices are so cheap right now that at worst you neg a few dollars risk for a potential +100% runup.Is this worth a yolo?Fuck it, I bought 10 contracts for 8/28 $57.5cSure why not, Aug 28 47.5c $1.64 checking in.Beat earnings last time.

In the space it lives in, webex is a stupid cuck sitting in the corner jerking his pud while Zoom and GTM fuck his wife.  Webex is also like a tiny tiny fraction of cisco's business.

We aren't 100% sure that they will old this play until after earnings.pretty low IV on options...inOkay okay you convinced me I‚Äôm infuck it, im in. first call option ever. sell Tues?anyone buying 8/14 calls?

or all 8/21 8/28?that was meHoping for a red Monday discount, hope I don't get screwed by waiting for the weekend.  I'm in if it's red Monday, good luck boys!Post screen of those positions or BAN!Cisco has been losing market share in the high volume rack server market for a while now, their Operator/ISP business is still consuming more R&D than it makes in revenue and core switching and routing is being replaced by open SD-WAN solutions. While there is likely an uptick in VPN licensing revenue the overall portfolio of Cisco products is struggling.

With many companies relying/using MS Teams which now is included in their O365 licenses and other competitors offering better products or better prices I'm expecting negative results and guidance from Cisco. I don't have positions myself but am expecting Cisco to fall to somewhere in the 41 - 43 range from EPS that will be 5 - 8% lower than previous quarter.Sadly my options buying power is waiting for deposit to clear on the 11th!

But the plan is to wait for the run up of IV, then sell put credit spreads to benefit from the IV pump.

The 44.5/45p spread is looking nice for 8/14, though I may also check 8/28 and see.I might liquidate some and hold some. I feel like this earnings could be big one for them... I hate how they almost never make crazy movesUp to you to decideI think so, im going throw 5k on the 49.5c if the price monday is around 0.45 per contract. that looks like a great price.I like it, that‚Äôs so far away lolSame, looks good to meWouldn‚Äôt that make the earnings better?? Higher net incomeThat's good news (obviously not for the people being laid off.) Trimming the "fat" will be good for ERWhy? More of a yolo though, they only have to move $2.50I'm looking at that exact call, only .67 per contract, thinking about going balls deep. Talk me into it.Go to ThinkOrSwim, find this option on the Trade -> All Products. Send it to charts and look at Option Time & Sales. It was a sweep (multiple buys at different quantities but all at the same time)!51 and 51.5 here. :)8/21 51 and 51.5 hereWho cares that WebEx sucks, we just need to elevate it to meme status and Cisco will fly. Also this is a UOA post, I couldn‚Äôt care less about how Cisco‚Äôs business worksAs someone who's role involves being on WebEx for about 30 hours a week, I agree it sucks.

But as I mentioned, I'm spending about 30 hours a week on WebEx at the moment.  

As is everyone else, who used to sit on meetings face to face...Why are we acting like WebEx is their only product? Cisco Anyconnect is the most popular VPN on the market, and it is used based on licensing. Many companies had to up the # of users allowed on their VPN with the full shift to WFH. That should factor into this play as well.Possibly a run-up play. I‚Äôm still trying to make sense of why they chose 08/28. If it has good guidance, we could see price target increases happening over the weeks after the earnings!Exactly, might be able to get out even before earnings if IV pops!If you want8/21 here. If it‚Äôs good ER might slowly gain more as time passesGo look at the graph yourself bud, don‚Äôt get owe you anything.There is plenty of space for WebEx to creep inFingers crossed for stimulus deal today so I can sell slv calls and yolo this tradeoops, meant $47.5, lolI looked at volume and it didn't seem to high. figured I should have taken a smaller strike price, but it seems to be a decent one after looking at a couple of tables.Do it!Thanks!How do I look at options and time sales?no fear

lemme see your war faceI 100% agree with you. $50 before or after earnings is going to happen. Just saying that  mentioning webex is dumb and this is the second CSCO post I've seen bring it up. 

Also, school isn't happening. Buy ZOOM and LOGM.Possibly. I'm any case I'm doing a run-up play for this 50c 8/21Comparing google search trends for Zoom and WebEx indicate that its unlikely that there is significant revenue growth for Cisco as a whole as a result of WebEx alone. WebEx is part of the applications portfolio at Cisco which is less than 10% of the revenue as a whole. Even if WebEx had doubled in revenue (which it definitely hasn't) it would be offset by losses on the infrastructure side both due to competition and supply chain constraints.That‚Äôs more like it üëåhttps://ibb.co/Hhw4hDSDo a trend search on zoom as well, it‚Äôs flat.SLV gang says otherwise. YOLO.You sure of that? https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=Zoom,webexThe fact that you are comparing them together lol, go talk to someone else cyaTHE TRAINS DRIVE THEMSELVES

It‚Äôs a no from me dog.Is that you Cramer?Brkb but for another reason.  Go to BNSF and look at weekly railcar loads.   Down from 15-20% this year.   Also rhey carry a lot of coal, which is declining rapidly with the push for green energy.   Profitable, but not my favorite right now.Train gain stop for no one.

Not so confident with this in the US until I see them lay track from Salt Lake to Vegas to LAWhat is this the fucking 1800‚Äôs get outta here with this Vanderbilt shitYeah like 7 rail companies own 94%of revenues across north America.   Great monopoly play... never bet against Buffett and bnsfAll in on MondayBro wtf is UPN?Ponzi scheme railroadingso lemme get this straight you're saying put money into railroads and wait until I win

ngl tho interesting idea. will watch for awhileMy grandpa worked for PRR. Do they have a ticker?Cn just had a big round of temporary layoffs and went from roughly 10 000 active cars to 1600 in the yard in my city.Yeah, I noticed that too this week, industrials were moving like crazy but I can't understand why. Any ideas ? u/tylerfromspring why do you think they moved and why they will continue to move?Lol what?  They ain't moving shit right now. 

They are fixing a lot of tracks though while the trains sit parked. 

Pretty good indication when they have a shit load of people furloughed. 

I even drove by UP headquarters the other day and they just had a train engine sitting there.Yeah theyre making so much money because they‚Äôre laying off a fourth of their employees. Fuck em. Would never give them any supportSame freight volumes, lower costs... CN or CPWhich company? I'm in Ontario considering CN or CP train conductor as a new careerThese 5 names together averaged 5.8% gain this week versus the Dow‚Äôs 3.8%

I will keep bagging calls, you keep buying Zucc BuxxSir this is a railroad depotAre you trying to make friends or are you just trying to make us some money?Loved my 205c 8/7 BRKBeez, the bag is so heavy the BNSF won‚Äôt even haul it for meGold and trains. We're living in the wild fucking westüöÇ üí® üíµFuck

E/ corrected typo in positions, but also buying UPN long, whatever the fuck it isFormer black centric television station.Who is ponzi I think I bought some of that todaySir please buy the ticket and take the rideI work for a class one railroad and you are flat wrong. We are busy as usual and brought back all our furloughed employees. The railroads have spent the last 4 years firing everyone in site to lower their operating ratios and cutting every bit of fat.Also work for railroad have not brought back all our furloughed. We are not busy as usual and have lower car loadings than 2008Hell yeah people are furloughed.  Huge cost savings.  My point is they don‚Äôt need people to move trains, homeboy.  Costs hugely reduced.  Freight strong and returning big-ly.  Look at the Q2 earnings beat for UNP for example.  And if you drove by HQ in Omaha, yeah they‚Äôre all WFH I believe.  There should not be a train in the employee parking lot tho, you should probably report that lmao.

Either way ROGER THAT COWBOY and good luckCareful which railroads, they're not all raking it right now.  Check US traffic data on AAR.  I've thought about it but the class 1's I'm familiar with are trading near levels that were established in times of higher volume and less future uncertainty.The better oneYou so good at beating the market you should work at Motley Fool's marketing teamif you work for UP or BN pls sort out the dwell time in LAXHmm guess all the people I know who work for bnsf and UP are liars. I'll be sure to tell them it's all a hoax.

Hell even the simple fact I can see a bnsf line out my fucking window that is not operating nearly the same as normal even though that's just simple observation.Thank you and you are 100% correct.  I am a customer of all 5 Us class 1‚Äôs as well as the 2 big CanadiansYea, i know far too many people in the industry both UP and BNSF. (Grew up in a railroad family) they are running just not the same.No you infact have to have an engineer and conductor to move the train certain places while an engineer in others (unions ensured this) it will be a very fucking long time before they make it so trains move without at least one person.  They got rid of breakmen a long time ago but the other 2 will be near impossible in the near future. 

Furloughs obviously cut cost but they make more when trains are moving.  Anytime a train is sitting still it's a huge fucking loss to the company. 

K so everyone is beating earnings basically the reason why is covid made everything scary.  Now we are kicking 10 yard field goals which are chip shots. The real trick is making the 40 and 50 yarders. 

Only thing moving on the line next to me is coal nothing else.  UP and bnsf have many reduced routes. (Word on the street)

Airlines are flying,  they just aren't flying the same.Very familiar with AAR carloadings.  I am weary of the Canadians and most bullish on UNP and CSXThey fired me because my first op-ed was titled Trainz GainzI'm sure there are different situations going on in different places it's a big country, however check the q2 freight numbers. Freight is back to pre Covid. They are doing more with less. Between PSR and the gutless unions they are working us non stop all year. I work on the east coast and our trains are all 185+ carsI understand how railroads work.  My point is that when carloadings get back to pre-Covid levels, the railroad will have shedded thousands of useless marketing/admin employees and will be running leaner than ever, love PSR or hate itLOL are u seriously saying self driving trains are impossible? There's a fucking track dude. Way fucking easier problam than self driving cars. Some cities even have fully autonomous metro lines.They are stealing that title for Monday.I'm just hearing way different things from a lot of people. Glad you guys are working. I have friends and family who are not. Mostly in midwest.I don't think he is saying they can't be run autonomously.  He is just pointing out that union rules require 2 men per train and he is correct.

What I am pointing out is that admin/other employees are being shed while productivity and profitability goes up.  This is a long-term trend/shareholder benefit but especially visible now as people are furloughed or "WFH".

https://www.statista.com/statistics/547736/number-of-employees-union-pacific-railroad/I don't think you can read or know much about railroad unions.  I'll let you go read about those for a bit and then come back to this comment and reevaluate. 

Good luck in your researchdamn post profitsyou guys really need to stop selling options on robinhoodHow much cash is your account autist?Gains or Ban!!!Please switch to a real broker and use SPX much better as it isn‚Äôt taxed the same and is cash settled.

Well you are proof selling options and thetaGang is the way and always has been.

I am also selling options but check this out.. on the futures!! and that means I can open and close positions anytime, at 12midnight, at 3am and close them at 4am! I can also trade this Sunday at 6pm! Futures are open on Sundays and trade all day and all night with a 1 hour break every day! they are only closed saturday!

https://ibb.co/VWG2ss4Robinhood is BAE and you are gayWhy?Can u elaborate on this?

And what's the difference if they both track sp500?Robinhood usually requires collateral so yea, although sometimes that ‚Äúcash‚Äù is margin.Mods ban himThis reads how a shitty 2am infomercial soundsmainly because robinhood will close a potentially winning position at a loss one hour before close if they deem it is too risky. also robinhood in general sucks: garbage fills, basic charting, sell order flow to HFTs etc.SPX is Euro style, no early assignmentHas happened to me more than once.Solution: get your picks right and RH won‚Äôt get you out of a dumper 1h before close.  Still trash I agree should be a toggleable setting to have that ‚Äúprotection‚Äù like it is pattern day tradingYeah but the UI of all other stock apps makes me want to kill myself and set my soul on fire with gasoline. RH doesn't have amazing UI but it's extremely clean. RH looks like Nintendo made the UI while all the other stock apps look like someone who likes the most complicated edition of dungeons and dragons became a UI designer.Who needs charting when trading options? Buy call, hope stock goes stonkz, buy dip, hope stock goes the opposite of stonkz. What is so complicated about it?I hate Robinhood as much as the next guy, but you‚Äôre delusional if you think TDA or Schwab aren‚Äôt also getting paid for order flow. Seriously, you can just look at their 606 reports.How can the seller close a position? I thought that was the the right that the buyer pays premium for. When I‚Äôve used RH to sell options, they have either required collateral for sold puts or required coverage for sold calls (covered calls). 

I understand not buying options for the reason of early close but I don‚Äôt know that it applies to selling them. Anyhow I do think they may skim some of those premiums when selling, and that may be a good reason to use a different platform.so what do u suggestI think you mean *bought* not *sold*. They can‚Äôt exercise an option you sold, only the party you sold to can do that.If I could just get my ‚Äúpicks right‚Äù I‚Äôd be a millionaire by now.when you sell an option to open a position, you can later buy to close that same position at any time (https://youtu.be/OyTOGDx2ZTA).i‚Äôm on thinkorswim and have negotiated my commissions to 0.50. i‚Äôve heard good things about tastyworks.Webull is pretty good ü§ôüèΩAhh ok, I thought they required collateral or covered shares for all contract sales. I see what you are saying nowHow did you negotiate the 0.65 options commission down to 0.5?How much in commissions have you paid to do that?I like ToS for the graphs but still use RH because I cant find 2FA for ToS. TDA has it so im not sure if im just missing it or what.$500. just nicely threaten to leave to another broker lol.Damn I‚Äôm already at 2k.call them and ask to lower itHow do you know this?When you look at the phone app go to the More tab -> Balances tab.[RIP ATVI 8/7 calls ](https://streamable.com/q779ze)I have September calls.

Silver has a MASSIVE upside here.

JPM inherited the old metals desk from Bear Stearns. These asshats loved to naked short Silver, and they could do it by stopping actual physical delivery because it was considered a "hedge". These shitbags have been MASSIVELY suppressing Silver since around 2011.  The "Classic" silver/gold ratio is around 16:1 in price.  Today it was like 79:1 - because it has been suppressed so long.

Silver has industrial uses of \~2m oz/day.  Silver itself is a pretty thin market anyways, so it tends to be volatile when supply/demand moves it around. Miners aren't really operating at full steam either, so supply is shorting up - and people still need silver for phones/TVs/Medical stuff/etc.

&#x200B;

Around March 23, the COMEX started settling Metals with PHYSICAL.  What this means is that the banks (mainly JPM) had to stop shorting (selling) Silvers futures contracts, or else they would have to pull Silver from their vault and actually deliver it to buyers.  JPM can only pull so much physical out of their vault, before they have none.  What you are seeing is Banks slowly unwinding their shorts which is price positive as Silver tries to find a new "natural" level compared to gold.  I would expect something like a 40:1 silver/gold ratio initially.

&#x200B;

The Fed is printing by the billions. This causes is inflation.  The Federal Reserve has already said they are going to let inflation run for a bit, and cap interest rates around 2% - we are near record lows for home mortgages again.  This means, that lets say inflation is 3%, well if the bond market is only earning 2%, then the REAL effective interest rate is -1%.  This is MASSIVELY price positive for metals. Metals are 0% assets, you can't eat your pet rock - but it doesn't go at -1% either.  One thing to watch is $TIP - as it goes higher, metals will follow.

&#x200B;

So with all the economic worry of the Fed printing money, and negative REAL interest rates, people are seeking a safe haven for a foundational asset.  This is causing a MASSIVE run on metals - and people can take physical delivery from the COMEX.  Last month, a record # of people are standing for physical delivery at COMEX, and I expect this to continue. ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-31/gold-traders-issue-largest-delivery-notice-on-record-at-comex?sref=kn8A42Ij&cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-commodities&utm\_content=commodities&utm\_source=twitter&utm\_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm\_medium=social](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-31/gold-traders-issue-largest-delivery-notice-on-record-at-comex?sref=kn8A42Ij&cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-commodities&utm_content=commodities&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_medium=social))

&#x200B;

We are in the middle of a massive historic run on metals, and the banks cant short(sell) Silver anymore.  So we have tons of buyers, and no sellers - price goes up.

&#x200B;

TLDR:

Craig Hemke is THE Metals guy - he talks about ALL of this in this video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EOPKizJ\_Y4&t=679s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EOPKizJ_Y4&t=679s))

&#x200B;

1. We are in the middle of a run on metals
2. There are no metals sellers
3. Price goes up
4. This week was super bullish and Thursday night we saw profit taking and a pullback on Friday - MASSIVELY bullish.

&#x200B;

I expect $75 Silver EOY, $60 around Halloween. Silver is already +127.4% YTD.If a big sell off happens in the market - a correction of 10-20% - then Gold and Silver will be sold to cover margin calls )like what happened in March/April). That‚Äôll cause a big correction in both those metals. 

If there‚Äôs only a small drawdown (1-5%) then it probably won‚Äôt affect SLV or GLD too much. They might correct a little just because they‚Äôve had such a big run up, but the longterm trend is still super strong. 

If the market keeps rallying, then SLV and GLD should keep moving higher.Up, down, or sideways. Nobody knows.

But silver is definitely more volatile than gold.Who knows really. I have physical in a safe and plan to hold it. Have accumulated it and gold since the 1980‚Äôs.It's gonna trade sideways for an unknown amount of days like after 7/28-8/3 before next leg is my assumption. Cashed out green at open, will reenter in a 2-5 days depending on market conditions.my prediction is that next week is going to be a fucking Red Wedding massacre, across the board (except for NCLH). because that's how you show our benefactors what happens when you promise stimulus and then just go on vacation instead. and then, Trump will Executive Order the shit himself, and then SLV will be back to the only thing worth waking up for8/28 30c all in! Let's go retardsI feel you. I FOMOed into it this week after my uvxy calls ate shit. Take a look at the max timeline chart for SLV... I only saw the two major run ups that didn't go up bigly, like parabolically. Also if you look at the really big increase it ran up over 4 months... So I'd expect it to keep increasing. Hoping for 30 before EOM. 

But then again, past performance is not a predictor of future performance

But know that slv also doesn't drop over night... So unless you're playing FDs, even if it does go down you should be able to unwind without toooooo bad of lossesThere‚Äôs an interesting segment from Tasty Trade about silver. 

https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/shows/small-stakes/episodes/trade-of-a-decade-in-silver-08-06-2020?_sp=c8a9a284-c249-4f62-95d1-1139c5ef8fba.1596857954937

TLDR: Silver has only run up 20% in a single week 2x in the past 30 years. Two times!

In 1998 >>> 20% move was followed by a 4% drop the next week >>> 17% drop the next month

In 2008 >>> +20% >>> down 7% next week >>> down 29% next month

2020 >>> +20% >>> up another 20% the next week!!!

So it‚Äôs crazy high, but not at ATH yet (like gold is). 

Seems like a strong possibility of a pullback before it goes higher.Trumps taking time off from golf on this one. You can count on him to save your extremely otm weekly SLV callsI think lack of stimulus will see a small selloff. Probably SPY 320 or so, maybe not that bad. Metals and GLD will dip slightly as well as they will drop if the market as a whole drops.

Unless if there is a mega crash or the FED makes a major policy announcement dialing back QE to save the dollar, SLV/GLD will rise over the course of the year. I would suggest waiting until Monday near close and buying Leap spreads with maybe 30 as the top. I could see us hitting low 30s at some point, but it might dial back a little as well.

If we get into SLV 35 or 40 range, there are going to be a whole host of other problems going on with the economy.

Edit:  I'll take that back. It could go up to 40 without the complete collapse of the dollar, but you'll be looking of a DXY around 70-80 maybe. If you are expecting it to moon you are talking about the US dollar becoming near worthless.I don‚Äôt follow Gold, but if Silver is 40:1 and silver is $75, gold should be $3k?

Maybe?Slv is stronger than gold by recent actionsRemindMe! 4 monthsUsually after a run up. It should pull back. Follow the the comet silver data. Shorts are being squeezed. Contracts moved to London. Be careful if you are YOLOing. Build a smaller position if you aren‚Äôt sure. Think longer term with silver. It‚Äôs climbs slow. $30 is a big when it gets there. A lot of bag holders from a long time ago.You said it yourself. SLV. What is silver? a commodity, comms are the new tech stock, buy as many you can. Oil, metals, corn, beef (have you seen meat prices at the store? they have tripled.), any of these are dank trades. I've been playing oil since the drop and it is nice income.AGQ spreads are dirt cheap FYI.  Not that slv calls are expensive but spreads on AGQ hedges the risk and buy in with about a 255% return on most spreadsWhat's next? SLV and GLD collapse because:

1. Equities selloff and panic ensues. Money flows out of everything as bears give everyone a reality check.

2. Equities rally and the bulls take full control by feasting on ZIRP, QE Infinity, and money flows into equities and out of "safe havens".

Either way, "precious metals" will collapse again. If you think metal is money you're gonna have a bad time.> I expect $75 Silver EOY, $60 around Halloween.

That would be fucking insane and also an historic moment.I just awarded you with silver w/ this DD. Thanks for the introduction to Craig Hemke. Really appreciate the awareness here.Ah a true connoisseur - old watchtower reader here and tfmetalsreport subscriber too. Making higher percentage in RLFTF this week but I‚Äôm heaving in AGQ/SLV/UGL and calls on bothWhat‚Äôs your EOY prediction for GLD baby cakesMy Nov 45cs hope you're right. I'd like to roll them into Jan 30c next week though.This video was fantastic. Looks like I'm converting to silver gang!Is there any good reason to go in on Silver mining companies at this point then? Is that a viable avenue as well?This summarized everything perfectly.  Thank you for this. üíØOmg thank you for this and the YT link!This post.

I don't know shit about metals but I watched that Craig Hemke video and i don't trust him.  I'm out>If a big sell off happens in the market - a correction of 10-20% - then Gold and Silver will be sold to cover margin calls )like what happened in March/April). That‚Äôll cause a big correction in both those metals.

The only thing preventing a correction/crash is that everyone expects it.  So there are a lot of short positions.  If a crash does happen the shorts will be ready and they'll know that the next step is a tsunami of liquidity from JP so the safest place is metals.Up down left right A B down up A.... Finish herThat's why I stick with goldYou‚Äôve been waiting a long time for this moment haven‚Äôt youBuy low, hold when it‚Äôs high?found the Peter Schiff accountI was massively up at open and things immediately tanked. How long do you usually have to sell before shit hits the toilet? Do you pre-market sell or just wait and put in some limit orders? Market orders?I tend to agree but I opened debit spreads so I‚Äôm holding for theta to tick away at the short leg. 

Will prob close this position and open a new further dated one simultaneously next week sometime.So...red across the board except for the safe havens that are SLV & NCLH?

Are the boats made out of gold???Dumb question: what does 30c mean?Seething. I‚Äôm up 200% on SLV calls. Going to buy more on Monday around noon.While I‚Äôll admit a decent portion of the silver run up has been due to the decline of the USD there‚Äôs also more demand than supply currently. 

The $60 price targets for leaps aren‚Äôt insane, just optimistic. 

Longer term, no stimulus could make things way more interesting than SPY 320. Like, cash is king interesting.I saw something saying that although gold is ATH in dollars, in real terms the ATH would be 2,800Yeah I paper hands the oil, thought the next month was going to go negative too "you're gonna have a bad time"üòÇi'm with you on #1 but the second QE is mentioned is gonna bring metals back in full force, imoIf you think a piece of paper backed by only faith is money, you‚Äôre gonna have a bad time.Except that JPOW will send every tree on the planet to the paper mill to be delivered to the printers before that will happen.I wanna be in the screenshot in 4 monthsI think that‚Äôll be the first move. The issue is the inflows to these silver ETFs.  If they are moving the books around and hypothocating silver - eventually they will have to square the books. -super price positive.Everything is historic at the moment... Unemployment, metals, stock valuations, debt-gdp. It is surreal.We are living through historic timesAny reason to spread rather than focus on one or the other?

[**Reminddit**](https://www.reminddit.com) ¬∑ [Create Reminder](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=remindditbot&subject=Reminder&message=your_message%0A%0Akminder%20time_or_time_from_now) ¬∑ [Your Reminders](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=remindditbot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=listReminders%21)I‚Äôm short rn and I feel like a moron for it.There's actually not a lot of short positions though.  The S&P equity put-call ratio is in a trough.  Maybe a lot are expecting a correction, but they don't appear to be betting on it with puts.Indeed. But it‚Äôs a small percentage of my overall just for an ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù moment like a currency issue. I swear I don‚Äôt wear a tinfoil hat. LolNaaa, he‚Äôs a douche. Never been right about anything.Oh honey.

Never market orders. You want to get filled at $2? Because that‚Äôs how you get filled at $2.i put limit orders typically. i almost never market order sell unless I must get out immediately (ive been fucked more than once on pricing). The reason is, my exps are out pretty far, nov 18 so i could technically hold for a week or two easily but i wanted to use the cash for other daily momentum chases.SLV is not safe, i was just saying it will respond well to any stimulus news. NCLH...all i can tell you is that i love that stock and i think it's because, for whatever reason, it's the place that has accumulated a mass of people that aren't ridiculous and pretty much no matter what, it's a reliable place to just chill and catch 0.5-0.20 cent moves all day every day at like the perfect volume that moves nicely but not so nuts you'll miss it if you blink, but it's not some stroll in the park to trade it so it keeps me on my toes and has schooled tf out of me. the spreads always normal, the price is cheap, it's ETB, before/after hours is always active, and pretty hilariously, it's seemingly impervious to the worst news possible. it's really just the best thing ever and i hope it never goes away. not made of gold, it "is gold"30c stands for 30 call options. I can't believe I'm responding to this lolSo, for the spike in 2011, it broke into the 50s for a narrow window of time before going back into the 30s. The only time in modern history where silver broke inflation adjusted 60 was during the turmoil going around in 1979-80. It would be not prudent to buy a $60 strike, I would suggest no higher than 35 or 40, but 30 would be ideal. It might spike to 60 and rapidly fall, like VIX would. Timing the top would be difficult.

If your goal is to hold to expiration, please pick a much more reasonable level. I strongly believe our current situation will mirror more of the 2011 spike. 30 or just below for leaps. If SLV then closes out the year in the mid 30s.

Short term expiration for some crazy spike is another matter.Gold has a 5k year history so sure, if you want to adjust the spot priced based on your ability to get it, it‚Äôs probably around there.

Google ‚ÄúSilver Eagles‚Äù and you cant get the 1oz silver coin for <$35. Premiums will stay up as the physical is hard to come by due to a run on metals, and the Mint is closed.

Buckle up, we haven‚Äôt seen shit yet.omg, if it does I will literally drop every cent with as much loans and margin I can get my hands on.Nah fam, same shit happened 2008-2011. Metals spiked from permabear retards and then metals crashed while equities went on a tear from QE. Silver still hasnt recovered it's losses from reaching ATH in 2011.It's not "faith". It's credit/debt. If you think metal is money, you're gonna have a bad time. You're the kind of person who thinks typewriters and snail mail are the future... not the past.Well you clearly don't understand the money supply. It's all digital.I just saved the comment and added a note to my calendar! See you on Halloween üéÉ>If they are moving the books around and hypothocating silver - eventually they will have to square the books. -super price positive.

Wut? Explain this sentence to me like the retard I am plz.I probably should just do SLv calls but insane movement at times with agq calls.So maybe at least some rise in price of slv?Lost 4k on uvxy calls buddy. HugsThe correction always happen a day before you think it will. Those ratios will change if the rug gets pulled.There are tons of puts, I don't have #'s but probably more than ever before.  There are just lots of calls too (especially FD's).
And calls can be bearish too, e.g. short SPX and buy protective calls, or hold cash and calls.Uvxy is still at very high levels and that indirectly tracks the options on spyWho will you sell it to in mad max world?Nice! I like playing NCLH too, just wish the options had a bit more volume.

It seems to have some sticky prices. For weeks it was staying between $16 & $18. Was easy to buy calls on the dips. I haven‚Äôt been playing it lately, but I guess that new area is around $14.Thank you! I'm glad you didBut who are you calling? Does robinhood have a call out button?Oh god no I‚Äôm not picking 60 as the strike on the leaps. 

I‚Äôll buy more debit spreads in the 29/32-32/35 range.So bet the house on silver now thenI meant the month where it went negative I thought the etc would go negative again so I got scared. Feel like a clown now of courseya but, that was back when everyone gave the fed the benefit if the doubt that what they were doing was a fix and then they would scale back out. now, that never happened and it made everything worse and QE is going directly to consumers that will jack up prices where before it was all contained on the fed balance sheet. there's definitely enough differences to not go all in on history exactly repeating itselfthere was no inflation, money went only into asset markets, if we hand it out to regular Joes this time, inflation could unfold bigIt is the faith that your pieces of paper are backed by the credit of the United States treasury. The United States treasury claims it can back it due to the gold it has in its reserves. This is why Ron Paul and Bernie Sanders types want to audit the Fed to see if we actually can back up what we claim we can.  In the end, gold will always be a store of value.  Nations rise and fallI wasn't sure if you were retarded until this postSame here. It‚Äôs in my calendar as well lmaoYou'll have to google it.  Hypothication (there is an investopedia video on it) of mortgages was one of the main reasons that housing loans crashed so hard in 2008.

This will be MASSIVELY by ORDER OF MAGNITUDE positive for metals prices.Those contracts were cash settled as no silver actually changed hands now they arent.Hypothication is when someone chokes themselves with a belt while jerking offI doubt it. The entire point of the fund is to reliably track Spot as best it can. Tends to track around 93% of the front month spot price.Right, the trough itself is an indicator that a correction might be close.Yes there are still a lot of puts.  Equity put volumes are available on the CBOE website if you're interested in the numbers.What‚Äôs an FD?52-week high of 135.00 and it's currently at 22.45.  Not a very high level.  Not even a medium level tbh.There‚Äôs no telling. I‚Äôm sure to sell it well before then. If there‚Äôs a dollar crisis, it‚Äôll be good to have. If not, I have a lot of shiny, pretty metal that won‚Äôt be worth zero to give my kids.Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.

I have 20/25 I bought at 18. I have to figure out next week what my next one will be.I am.ah yeah, no one knew wtf was going on, I bitched out too. Dont beat yourself up.If inflation rises too fast they will just raise interest rates. It's really a non issue. They had to do it in 2015/2016 too.OMG you're a fucking retard who has no idea how this works. I can't believe you tried making the doublespeak argument that "pieces of paper backed by the credit of the Treasury need to be backed by gold reserves" sit the fuck down and shut the fuck up because you have no fucking idea what you're talking about.Have I been assigned homework?Bingo. Month over no the COT shows shorts reducing.  We‚Äôre at the very start of a bell curve shape.Ah gotcha, do you think we‚Äôll see a pullback in the short term then? Or reach 30 first?Yeah 22.45 is rediculous high dumdshit idk if you just downloaded robinhood and saw it at the top of the etf list or what but this thing regularly trades less than 10 and reverse splits back up to mitigate contango loss. If your new to this index check out some of the volitility subs before you use mommies card sweetie!Me too. Let's get rich or we can beg togetherI kept reading they were getting tight on storage and some 'experts' said it would go negative again. Oh wellSo bet the house on silver now thenpure silliness. yes they raised rates like twice that was purely to save face after never displaying any evidence of "backing out" of QE4ever and we got to what, like 1%? when Volker raised rates to fight inflation in the 80s we were up to like 18%. we cannot service the amount of debt we have with the rates it will take to affect inflationYou clearly lack reading comprehension skills. Nowhere did I say it needs to be backed by gold. I stated that it is backed by the faith of credit of the United States treasury. You truly are an autistMilitary power is the true store of wealth. If the dollar collapses, metal might be money, but weapons will be wealth. Sad but trueSonny, you've been on your Bloomberg Terminal for too long again. Go do you homework!Yes.Last week was sideways chop, and we were up a little Monday night.  Then Tuesday we were off to the races.  I expect us to bump sideways for a few days (like today) but we are no where near done with this thing.Last split was Sept 2018.  UVXY is something of a VIX tracker.  VIX is low.  UVXY is low.  Smoke more.Well we'll see what happens but metals are not going to do well. I'll stand by that.Dude just google it. The fed makes zero claims that it holds gold to back the USD. 

Your spouting some grade A retardation. 

That shit ended when we ditched the gold standard for FIAT currency. The USD is backed by GDP and GDP only.Totally agree! Hopefully end of next week we see some price action if not early the following week!Smoke more?  Nah this is just wsb get your facts right.  Uvxy always has always been a vix tracker but it tracks volitility by representing the put options on the spy.  That‚Äôs fundamentally what it tracks.  Here are some links that explain it better.  Sometimes it moves with the spy and if your quick those can be times to get some sort of a short position because it usually corrects itself real quick.  If you know what it‚Äôs physically tracking you can capture more opportunities with this index.

https://sixfigureinvesting.com/2015/03/how-does-uvxy-work/Except you're wrongon what time frame? they're definitely due for a correction but... jeez, have you actually looked at any charts? if you can't tell this stuff is strong AF then idk what to tell you except... good luckIt is not redeemable by gold, correct.  Like I said from the start, the dollar is backed by faith alone.  https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.aspExcept no one is debating what the UVXY is.  You said it's at very high levels, I say nah, then you say I don't know shit because it regularly reverse splits, then I point out the latest split was Sept 2018 and now you shift the goalposts.  Just own it.  The UVXY is not at "very high levels" given the current circumstances of having come off a huge volatility event.[deleted]No ugood luck, famJust own it bro!!!!!! From a long term perspective sub $10 is what this thing regularly trades at.  Uvxy traders know. üòêNo you bothalready up 200% with many stop losses set. keep losing buddyAre all uvxy traders that bad at charts?  It hasn't traded below 10 in years.  Are you saying we've had "very high" volatility for the last 2 full years?  Nonsense.Stop losses don't work after hours. When it collapses, your stops wont help you loltrue but i also already profit taken my investment and some :P keep losingsuch arrogancefuk uwell, that struck a nerve lolAre you looking for the SILVER/GOLD/PURPLE Support group threads??Why's everyone whining? Earnings is still next week... HOLD THAT SHIT5 8/21 $35c. -79%8/21 $20C purchased at $2.25

If anyone on this sub is bullish on PRPL it's that dude, and somehow you thought it would beat that price by 30%?###Pretty fucked up username OPSeeing y‚Äôall down so much has me hyped to go buy some at a discountI went stupid long and bought 1/15@35 for 3.40 thinking that was as low as it would go. Now I‚Äôm retarded TWICE.30c 8/21 down 1600 bucks as of now. Still think ill be fine though, not even going to lie.Originally 30c 21/8  but I sold   a 35c to cover my cheeks thank God. Decided to go for a 25c 21/8 -30%.


  I knew I should have waited for a red day .8/21 25C
Should have bailed last week when I was up
FML

TradingView had a nice ‚Äúart of the pump and dump‚Äù article attached the the PRPL ticker, deliberately blaming reddit.9 8/21 $25 is where I‚Äôm at, managed to buy during dip9/18 30c can confirm am fucked!Yikes... I was up 80% a few days ago now -20% because I didn‚Äôt pay attention wtf lol22 8/21 $35c @$1.85 8/21 $35c (8 contracts)9/21 30c
Down ~30k, bought almost every dip but IV is bleeding me8/21 $35c. -57%$25c 8/21. Should have cashed out on Tuesday when I was up 10k. Now only up a couple hundred30c @25$ ... down $5000What the hell is PRPL and why are all you retards buying calls?Bought a single warrant at $4.20 its now at $6.40

Really wish I'd of pulled the trigger harder.Sold 8/21 $25p at $2.75 on Monday.9/18 20c, holding longer than I wanted to because they confirmed earnings so damn late. Hoping next week will do something, it has hardly moved either direction for a week.I had 8/21 22.5C, 8/21 35C, 9/18 30C, and 10/16 35C. Today after taking multiple purple dildos to the asshole, I sold the 22.5C that I had bought awhile back that was still up like $700, just to lower the risk of the position a little bit. I then sold the 8/21 35C because it seems like it's not going to happen, and I bought more 9/18 30C.

So now I'm going in with 10 9/18 30C contracts and 4 10/16 35 contracts.

I've grown to expect an assfucking these days so I'm a little more resilient but damn.Slow bleed. Post earnings will fall to 50 day MA of $19. Shit cash flows.Puts, 9/18 $20 @ $1.50I had bought $30s before and sold early in the week for DIS then bought back in today during dip. Luckily I made $200 at the time, would have been ducked if I waited till nowSold half my positions, and all warrants, at 450% and 75% return respectively before the dip.

This is my first real options play aside from a 4 bagger in AMD during that first spike. I‚Äôve learned a shit ton, unfortunately most of it after the fact. Namely, that I could have been purchasing spreads manually in RH by way of the ‚Äúselect‚Äù button when looking at a calls in RH. I was slow and lost without my easy ‚ÄúDiscover‚Äù button offering me a series of shit spreads (basically expirations tomorrow or 2022). That being said I‚Äôm still up ~50% overall in PRPL including the stonks.

I‚Äôm going to hold a little bit of calls through earnings too. I know I‚Äôll lose a bit of cash, but to me there‚Äôs no better teacher of watching what will happen to IV post-ER than seeing it happen real-time.

An IV question from a newly diagnosed spectrum dweller:

How fucked will I be on the 8/21s in terms of crush if PRPL exceeds on EPS and revenue, including the good news of mid-term growth? Never seen the IV crush personally. Is there a chance that if the ER is the nuts, that IV creeps back up to a profitable % on the low strikes before 8/21.

Riding it out until $0 like a true jackass should, or until my ass gets too sore. üçëüçÜI have the same for August and Sept and holding tight. If it hits 30 by Sept I might even exercise a couple. Godspeed friend!People here don't understand spreads. It "caps their gains" and they want 10+ baggers. To be honest I prefer it this way. I don't know what would happen if a ton of people started actually learning how to use options.

As long as lots of people lose money, market makers are happy to execute at these prices. I fear shit would get fucked up if people actual even read the dd they then unsuccessfully followed.  

Basically we need to feed the stock gods human sacrifices so that we can actually make money.Everybody has a kinkDo it, I dare youI doubled down. Joke on uSet it and forget it.

|-|-|-|-|Free cash flow is from the cash flows statement. It‚Äôs cash flow from operations minus purchases of cap-ex you dumb ass. Cash going up was probably because of financing activities. They borrowed the money. You are destined to lose a lot of money.Fuck u and good for youThey are production limited. Even with the new machine, it will be hard to hit a run rate over $900m or so.  The value is more about the growth story.That‚Äôs what happen to ATVI ü§≠ don‚Äôt get me wrong ATVI is a great company I made a few grand off it but I sold a couple days before earnings because companies tend to die after earnings are released since its ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù and PRPL is at a fair price right now for what it is a mattress company. Now the next earnings will be the one to make money off. üöÄYou have no idea how much I love you.Lol you forgot which sub you're at? PussyBurned for holding especially if the options are high strike/early expiration. Good company, great fundamentals, but probably correctly valued at its current price - at least for right now. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I hope this comment ages like milk.Very. You need a 54% rise to get your money back ü§£No, they didn‚Äôt finance anything. Debt is only about $30k. 

STFU and try actually reading the financials.this is completely different. no idea what the beat will beyah, I knew the IV crush would kill gains, but I let 20% of my original bet ride to see what would happen. Missed out on a couple grand of gains. Oh well...I also hope this comment ages poorly.

Bc heres the thing.

I bough SLV calls a couple weeks ago. 18c, 20c, 22.5c.

The 18 and 20c printed instantly, but I felt that maybe my 22.5s were a bit over valued.

So I held them for a week while they were bobbing around just in the negative. I had time on them so I told myself ill give them another week and then cut losses or sell them as soon as they went green.

Well, Monday came.  They very slowly crept into the positive. I nonchalantly logged into my broker to sell them. Thanking the lord they even momentarily went green.

Sold.

Ez


Well inche k the price a moment later and its red again. Phew i say. Glad i dipped out while i could.

I made about 12 dollars on these calls.

If i had waited 30 mins before selling, I'd have seen the ridiculous green dildo that formed, and all my purple losses would be erased by my SLV profits.

Not my best trading day. So I'm going to hold these calls till they expire worthless if I have to. They are down like 80% as is. Id kill my dog if I sold right now and the direction changed.

I love my dog too much.I love a challengeRoll them forward if you can and sell >/= 30c expiring this month if the price reaches 27 again.What does roll them forward mean? Sell the shorter calls you own and buy longer out calls? I own 2 8/21 30c and 2 8/21 35c which I‚Äôm down 46% and 64%. I‚Äôm really hoping it hits 27 again before earningsI literally have thousands of dollars on a fucking mattress company because of two strangers. 

What the fuck has my life come to?Purple is apart of the pride flag. They‚Äôre gay the fuck did you expectThe earnings for this is going to be one of the most spectacular things to witness either way.I'm holding $30c 8/21Such a stud, offended by the whale comment but I‚Äôll let it pass when we are rolling in purple tenders.I did same with purple, blizzard and cvs.Prpl nurpl gang reporting for dutyHold through ER, and you will be abundantly paid off $$$$$!$5k deep in naked calls hereHolding the line!!If they report a run rate of $900m and you give them the same sales multiple as Tempur Sealy (1.3), that should give them a share price of $23.50.  That‚Äôs a bare minimum for me, since you need to add a growth multiple and also account for PRPL‚Äôs higher margins. A sales multiple of just 1.5 gets you to $27 and a multiple of 1.7 is over $30.cut your loses manYou me an me both buddy.U should stick some money in ur mattress and burn it. More entertaining that wayBut did you die?Im laughing so hard because of how obsurd this is but also because I too have thousands of dollars in a mattress company because of strangers on the internetwe same same, but different. but still same.Lmao me too brother. Let's hope it all pays off and we can start listening to all of these two dudes plays and get rich.

Edit: 2 guys 1 stockI have $12k riding on PRPL. Hoping I don‚Äôt lose it all. It‚Äôs the only play I‚Äôve ever made that I felt comfortable with a few weeks ago. This week has shown me I‚Äôm not so sure anymore, but am still gonna ride it through earningsI mean, I guess it could be worse.Makes for a good story tho amiriteNo kidding I have purple lube just in case it‚Äôs bad and purple lube just in case it‚Äôs goodTenders? WTF is with the hard r man. Relax rich guyIf these purple plays pay off, I'll send you an album of my girlfriends nudes.I‚Äôm having NAT flashbacks.I suspect they will crush earnings because of UI benefits. Many people who didn't necessarily need it to survive got like 20k in UI, and I'm guessing many used it to upgrade furniture and shit like that.

It's difficult for the average person to commit large chunks of money to a mattress or some gay purple ass pad, but with UI it's probably the first thing they buy.Did big money force PRPL to close below $24 for warrants reasons?Hold this shit through earnings it‚Äôs different don‚Äôt ask me to elaborateThen buy a purple mattresswhen im bathing in tendies a week from now, it will be because of you. if I end up tendiless - it will be because of me. 

Blessed be, holy PRPL father - I have not lost the faith.Now imagine how many people I could convert to Jesus based on my mattress conversions.!remindme 1 weekI'm changed to pennies because I couldn't handle losing 100% all the time since im retarded and only played weeklies. Whats important that I have learned in pennies is to trust your plan. The market can do what it will do, but if you have an entry plan and a profit and loss plan, don't even look at the market, just know you'll be right.‚ÄúFelt comfortable with‚Äù LOLSo you‚Äôre only comfortable when every day is green?

|-|-|-|-|100% they crush street estimates. As for price movement that is dependent  on how the media reacts. I believe we will touch 30 after earnings as long as we are around 25 pre earnings.We must be the same personI don‚Äôt really think that, just having flashbacks.NegativeIt resets the clock on consecutive trading days above $24, but who knows what else they have plannedFree robinhood stockWould there new factory and new employees that work at said factory put a hamper on there earnings? Do you think forward outlook will overpower a lower eps?Lol- wishing you luck bro.Those were dark times.I hope not. I actually did august 25/30 debit spreads when price was 25ish and while everyone else was cursing you when it dumped, I don‚Äôt think I ever got down more than 15% on those.Thats low-key bullish in my opinion,  and it makes sense to me.Thanks, you seem pretty confident in the play. 
Don't worry she's not fatYeah - I gave solid risk adverse advice and they squandered it.It's not too late either! They can cut losses, re-enter in spreads, sell puts, re-enter in shares with covered calls. Plenty of decent gains to still be made!It‚Äôs all a game for them lol#fuck the boomersThat's absolutely fucked. And yet Monday will always be greeBig dick Steve laughed like a man worth 300 million dollars with a hot ass wife.So this is bad for the economy right?

Got it. 

SPY 8/14 350CNot sure why this is so hard for people to understand. Mark Meadows would never support any of these talks, yet he‚Äôs a key negotiator. It was never going to work. Trump wants the glory of EO, but it‚Äôs toothless.People think this is bad news, but Mnuchin laughing says it all.  This impasse appears to be great news for the 500 largest companies.  At least one significant small business plan is ending Saturday.  Unemployed professionals at small companies are no longer getting an extra $600 a week and are willing to go to big companies at a discount.  As the deal grew less likely during the week, SPX spiked.  The rich companies are about to get richer.

They are laughing all the way to the bank.They shouldn't pass it and let the market correct itself.I wish I'd seen this last night so I could have pulled out at open

Ah well, I assumed this would happen too and I should have planned accordingly.Now that i think about it, all i care about in next bill is 1. Direct $1200, 2.

Cleanse the heretics.Da red wunz go fasta!This explains the acceleration rate of my portfolio. IV is probably over 1000%WAAAAAGH\>200% IV. This cannot possibly go wrong.I looked at strangles earlier today, the prices are so fucked up that they only pay out at insane deviations. I can put up some charts if people are interested.

Basically the market already thought of that, and the only way you can win is to pick a direction and be correct.My long puts lost halfI bought a single KODK 2.5 1/15 PUT last Thursday. I wouldn't be surprised if it expires ITMWSB in a nutshell. Im in with 100% of my portfolio at open.Strangles >>>> straddlesLooked at prices for a 20 strike puts and if you had bought them 7/30 at 12:45, you could've bought them for 2.30ish and the highest it got was 8.20 lol I thought about buying puts for it the next day after the run too.. could've made bank lolWhy not - because it‚Äôs fucking stupid. Afterthought- why yes then...Ah shit, I'm selling a 20C 8/21.lol underlying has to move  >21.7 / <3.3 to breakeven at expiry for that 8/28 20c/5p, that should be funYou‚Äôre fucking retarded as fI bought a 8/14 8p after the legal trouble was announced.

More than sure it'll expire worthless, but whatever, you'll never get anywhere without taking some leaps of faith. [https://13wham.com/news/local/dfc-says-kodak-deal-on-hold](https://13wham.com/news/local/dfc-says-kodak-deal-on-hold)The KODK deal is some crazy shady shit. But like you said, we live in a different reality now.I can already see the threads next week. "Bought a call and put, why did I lose money on both?"No but see when it spikes again the IV will be >300% and even the one that loses will go upWelcome to theta gang.It‚Äôs just an IV play. It works when the markets are logical and things are stable, but you‚Äôve got a big known unknown. 

The real way to profit on them is IV pump. Strangles are printing bigly a couple times a month.I'm only interested if your charts will get me tendies and yachtsThe weird part is Kodak is the one who appoints the committee... Seems pretty redundantClassic wsbVega gang stole your tendiesits not going to spike again... pump and dump is over everyone sold, its back to being the dog shit it has been for the last 20 years.The last time I did this I made a killing.

Eh it'll probably jumpProbably Monday if she's a massive pump. Keep a couple and sell em later in the weekYeeeeeeAMD is not shitting on Nvidia graphics sales. They're doing a lot better now, so they did take some market share, but Nvidia is still killing themHey. That's why I tagged it as a yoloCont4acts are significantly lessTy love you tooI have Nvividia Gfirce thing and haven‚Äôt used it yetIndeed they are not. I do have an AMD GPU because the cost benefit was good at the time of purchase - even more so considering that FreeSync monitors are cheaper than GSync. 

But NVDA has:

* CUDA

* Ray tracing 

AMD doesn't have either (it can use OpenCL but so does everyone else)

Some of this may be a fad (like PhysX, still NVDA but very few people are talking about it today). 

I'm on red team but I'm considering NVIDIA for the next GPU upgrade.AMD is the new cool kid again. N will have to come up with some really kickass stuff soon.Fair enoughThat‚Äôs like saying my lambo has a CD player but I haven‚Äôt used it yetGraphic cards are not just for gaming FYIHopefully. Fully intending on getting whatever the top tier card is if it's 2080 level or better, and a 4600X probably. Rocking a 3600 and 5700 (with XT bios) right now, but AMD has a history of over-hyped parts that just don't compete on the high endI would never use a CD player. Who uses CDs still?I know, why else would I have mentioned CUDA?It's a smoother, warmer soundThan?Oh I was jokingI‚Äôm too retarded to catch sarcasmIt‚Äôs ok to be retarded when infinite money exist!I love money. Now just to have enough of it for hookers, cocaine and an expensive collection no one in the world collectsPeople will hate but this exactly the kind of mindset that will make you money. I‚Äôm in.You left out one important piece of information. In their last ER they announced partnership with AMZN. AMZN will be rolling out Slack to all 40,000+ employees. As part of their deal Slack will replace their voice chat in favour of integration with Amazon Chime. Slack will also be integrated with AWS somehow (I don't remember the details).

TLDR: 

* I have WORK $35 calls expiry September 18th. 
* I need to average down.Good luck you beautiful autist.  I‚Äôve been burned  by MSFT, PAYC, and TWLO earnings so I‚Äôm not playing WORK which means it‚Äôll probably double over night...Former bag holder of slack after last earnings. Rode the last pre-earnings wave for too long. Might do the same thing except not bot a tard and actually sell before earnings this time lolThis DD is so retarded that it might work.  It happened last time. It could happen again. 

Regarding the comments about an acquisition, if companies were thinking about buying Slack, this is the time. Not Microsoft, they don't need them. But Salesforce, SAP, and bunch of other enterprise platform providers should grab them now.I have 100 shared avg of 33 something and have been getting clapped. I dont see this stock booning unless theyre turn a profit which they havent. They just do a shit ton of SBC and have huge operating expenses. I didnt do my research when i bought. I followed your shitty mentality. So lets baghold this bitchI wouldn't count on there being a huge run up. I've been watching a handful of similar companies and I barely saw a difference in trading until the week of earnings, and even then they were up maybe 15% if they were lucky. 

It's a little too late now to act on this, but my money's on AVYA, they'll be releasing earnings Monday morning.Company I work with uses MS teams (paid). Friends use slack (unpaid.) So if they use sign ups and hit it hard during ER, it could go to tendie town. But revenue is probably gonna suck because too many people are using the free version.How high do you think itll go?I got my order in with like ten seconds to go today. Why not?Fuck it, I'm in.I remember last earnings season.... I'm in.This post was flaired as DD so it's on the DD list.

**^(*My owner is monitoring these posts, reply with feedback! You can now track comments by mentioning me!)**But WORK has a history like MSFT of going down even on good news. The stock is toxic. And I say this as a perpetual WORK call holder since I actually believe in the company (but their lack of a free video conferencing option is killing them).and then they dumped from 40 to 31 dollarsBut in the case of MSFT and TWLO, if you bought calls 3-4 weeks in advance and sold right before ER you would've made lots of money. And that is exactly what OP is telling you to do. 

You dumbasses need to stop holding calls through earnings.Just noticed my grammar is trash sorry was in a rush>I‚Äôve been watching a handful of similar companies

Who exactly?The market is too retarded for me to even put a number on that, but I think it‚Äôll definitely have a run-up to at least $32 before ER.I agree. If they get acquired, they‚Äôll moon, but I doubt anyone would buy them. MSFT would be the best bet, but they already have Yammer. But again, staying as unbiased as possible and despite my calls being affected, their future outlook looks grim. Who gives a fuck though, retards from r/stocks will still hurl bricks of cash at them.Yes sir. It's at a good support level as well.Lmao. Shit wasn't moving so I just let it go for $60 profit.That‚Äôs because there‚Äôs nothing incentivizing for it to go up. It‚Äôll power through the resistances with ER anticipation.Mainly because I believe everything Slack does, Microsoft or another company just does it better.

You want a company-based social media? There‚Äôs Yammer for that.

You want to assign people tasks? 
There‚Äôs Outlook for that. There‚Äôs also ServiceNOW, Jira&Confluence, etc.

You want to talk with people?
There‚Äôs Zoom, Skype, Teams, etc.

Their market share is pretty good, but I don‚Äôt think their future outlook is good unless they get acquired, but I am unsure if there would be any potential buyers out there.That‚Äôs why we won‚Äôt hold it through earnings, this is a pure momentum play. And there‚Äôs not much risk, even if it drops a bit between now and earnings, the increase in IV will mean you can probably break even. 

You compared it to MSFT, which tends to run up pre earnings, which is what we want. 

The risk/reward ratio is very good on this play imoYes, but that was because they declined to provide guidance for the next quarter. Another important point the OP missed.

Edit: I am not trying to sell this to anyone. I am just sharing what I know. Please do your own DD and follow what seems to be the best course of action to you.Yup, learned my lesson.  Bough HD calls last week and planning to close them on day of ER to get in on that sweet IV spikeI might be in a bubble. All the companies I've been working or interviewing for in the last couple of years used some combination of Google, Slack and Zoom.

I think Slack has a superior UX and don't think Microsoft can compete with it because they're moving too slow. Also their support outside of Windows has not been great in the past. I think Microsoft's biggest advantage is also its biggest weakness: They offer a full suite of products, so it might be cheaper in the bundle, but overall their products are inferior to specific counter parts. So in a traditional office environment with Windows, I think Microsoft might be the better choice, but given the accelerated trend towards working remote, communication and UX are too important to justify the selection of inferior products.

I thought Amazon might want to acquire Slack. It would also be a direct strike against Microsoft with which they're competing already on the cloud (AWS vs Azure). However since the senate hearings, I think Amazon might want to hold off on that.I said it at 19 and ill say it again. Keep pumpingyou wont even be able to short this stock for 2-4 weeks even if you hate itPREPARE FOR TROUBLE!

People are just grabbing change off of it by day trading. 

There's a bit of a caveat that there's a bunch of delinquent mortgages out there and a bunch of fed back stopped loans.  When that rug gets pulled housing market could get ugly.  I wouldn't say this is a sure fire win. If anything it's a long term play and let's be honest pretty much no one here cares about that.You‚Äôre right that it‚Äôs a real company making a profit. But a lot of people are pumping it up rn just because it‚Äôs continuing to go up. I‚Äôm going to buy and hold for long term after the hype subsides and it becomes a bit cheaperIt‚Äôs ok they don‚Äôt get it at the momentA decade after

But I wont mind one as It could be a shot to up my position some.  Long term hold for me as well.

Yes, that is indeed the plan üç∑Whats ur contract price and strike?Absurdly overvalued company.I‚Äôm an idiot but, all those people that went to LA fitness type gyms are too wealthy to take risks going back (not even open in my area).

Of course I guess the same could be said for half the market lately with these random pumps and dumps that happen on zero news.It is another bowflex, thigh master, ab roller, nordic trac.

What is the market cap of PTON? 19.3 billion?

Is an exercise bike company capturing 1/5 of all exercise or just 1/5 of all exercise revenue? (By stock valuation) 

Traditionally a healthy p/e of 20-25, values this company at a market cap of $0.  If this company is operating at a forward looking p/e value where 19.34 billion is in the 20-25 p/e range of profit because it has no realistic competitors because it has a healthy advantage in its own exclusive television workout marketplace and the barrier to enter this market place is relatively insurmountable, I cannot wait to see Pelotons first 1 billion dollar sales (profit) year!

Your investments are so good that even when you try spending, they go up my 1/15/21 200c is up 366%86% percentage surge in BRK.B profits does not really matter, as it is mostly a non-realized gain which is just the increase by the broader market, more important is to look at the purchase they did of additional shares of companies, any new loans/prefs they bought.

The $10 bln writedown is much more interesting, as he suggests that the value of Precision Castparts is $10bln+ below the original purchase price (i.e. he is making a loss on this) .

The repurchase of its stock is a good sign, as he believes the BRK is undervalued.Trust in papa buffetRead my latest DD to get my thoughts.Wait did they release earnings today on Saturday? Didn‚Äôt know that was allowedJust realized that Buffett bought an ADDITIONAL $2 Billion of stock in July. So BRK is still  10% undervalued based on Friday's close. This is based on a 1.3x book multiple, which is the lower side of BRK's trading history.Bought 100 shares at $79. Hope it drops so I can buy more :)I only buy full shares of brkBag holding 200C 8/21 , up 1200% as of Friday

I don't mean to be a buzz kill, but you might want to take some gains.Dodging bombs, making money! Fuck yea!ImpressiveDid you have an open call when it went parabolic from like 1k to 1500 in 2 weeks beginning of July?  What do you do in that scenario?

Israeli is good at stocks üê≠U belong here coz u seem to be gambling.it's up to your risk tolerance

A rule of thumb with TSLA - don't be greedy coz they can go tits up in just few trading daysI sell calls

Note that currently the share price at 1450 and I'm at my ATH, which is way above the days when TSLA closed above 1600You're only killing your own buzz my dudeMy guess would be buy back at the next dipShould be able to buy it back after theta eats the premium and sell another one.my current positions:

sold 8/21 1680C bought 1820C sold 9/18 two 1630C bought two 1720

I sold also 1900C for 9/18 few weeks ago (collateral is my 100+ shares) and yesterday I bought it back for 3000$+.

I hope TSLA will go up before\\after the Q3 and then I'll sell one heavy OTM call, such as, 2700C for Jun-2022 (will cost about 30-40K$)

&#x200B;

If TSLA goes down, Im fuked.. but I don't care, will buy moreNot if it's ITM.  When Tesla was hovering around 1k, you might sell a call for 1200 thinking it's way OTM and safe.  But then it mooned to 1500 within 2 weeks and never dipped back down.  I normally keep rolling forward since I sell CCs on long term holdings that I don't want to have called away.  So far have been lucky and have eventually recovered enough to buy back.  But with something like TSLA I'd be worried more about that.Tesla will be at $2700 next year when the Cybertruck and robotaxis roll outYou‚Äôd have exercise risk sure, but if you don‚Äôt get assigned and the option holder plans on taking to expiry, you can buy back the option at a loss close to the gain you get from the appreciation of the underlying.  1DTE your premium will be much less than what you sold for and the intrinsic value is recovered by not having the stock assigned.

Edit: assuming a CC.First, balls

Tell me how that goes for ya xxOkay, I thought you did a nice yolo for the right reasons then I see this retarded DD.  Tesla's going up and everything is the opposite of you said except some possible fluffing up of earnings. Real car companies are making garbage diesel vehicles. This also only works 1 day every 2-8 weeks.

Only reason Tesla went down is that the entire market was pricing in for potential stimulus news which didn't happen and Sino-US trade uncertainty.Oh ok, I don't use Robinhood but someone else posted that online.This! I love the courage but goddamnmoron! moron! moron!

üî´ Always has beenBig factsEXACTLY! because if you lose the money, it‚Äôs okay you would have to work all your life anyway. But if you hit jackpot, you can retire with 5 millions in your bank account at 50, something boomers took for granted.True, also I'm not sure if the boomers on r/investing are more knowledgeable. However I am sure that they would jizz their pants with a 15% profit per year.Upvote. The internet is a wealth of knowledge and our generation was born into the world of google-for-knowledge. The next generation will likely be more intelligent than we are, as will the generation after that. Boomers love to claim infinite wisdom but cling to rapidly decaying knowledge of out-of-date fundamentals.Lmao Chappelle as Prince is one of the funniest things everEven if they did there is to much momentum someone else will be willing to offer free options trading.Just say you‚Äôre a ‚Äúüåàüêª‚Äù.This! I'm in my 20s. I can gamble away a few grant ang get it back with some months work but if you go 10x/20x/50x/100x it is a significant amount which can - conservatively invested - make your life much easier in the long run.That‚Äôs so bullishFree isn‚Äôt the issue.

Bears still got cucked, buy the dip.They've been in the shitter for over a decade. 

Even before I left there in '08.

They've never been able to compete with local grocers on price. And they were big brained enough to own and maintain their own trucking fleet. So I don't see how they even adjust that Titanic.

Before I left, they were kicking off an international expansion initiative so maybe they can pivot that way. Most of the people I knew there have moved on elsewhere so I don't have any current insight, unfortunately.Makes sense, unless: priced in. Stock is already down 10% from early June. Is only half way back up from March low way underperforming broad market.  But ya, shock of the actual may cause a further dip.This post was flaired as DD so it's on the DD list.
